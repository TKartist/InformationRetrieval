With the launch of the new V12 engine in the DB7 Vantage, production of the earlier straight-six DB7 ended in mid-1999. Features include: remote central locking, electric heated seats, tinted glass, heated windscreen, touchtronic gearbox with paddle controls on the steering wheel, traction control, complete tool kit, V12 power plant, remote central locking, heated rear windscreen, electric windows, electric folding mirrors, heated rear window, tinted glass, immob, alarm, Tracker, burr walnut trim, cruise control, climate control, adjustable steering wheel, metallic paint, Alpine stereo system, multi CD player, power amp and electric boot control.

Enzo Ferrari decided to pay tribute to his late son by posthumously releasing the Ferrari Dino, although it was not a Ferrari as it was released under a subsidiary brand called Dino.\n\nEnzo created the Dino brand specifically to produce V6 engine cars to compete with the commercially booming Porsche 911, which had negatively impacted Ferrari's sales figures. Enzo did not consider the 911 a true competitor to Ferrari and believed that a Ferrari should not have a V6 engine. Thus, he established the Dino brand both to compete with Porsche and to honour his son, while preserving the reputation of his beloved Ferrari brand.\n\nDino Ferrari was tasked with designing a small engine that met the standards of Formula 2 championships, which Ferrari would use in their racing cars. He began designing a V6 engine, which was relatively small by Ferrari standards. However, Dino died before he could complete the design. According to regulations, cars participating in Formula 2 races had to be produced in a minimum of 500 units, which was a challenge for the small Ferrari factory. Ferrari enlisted the help of Fiat, which would produce the V6 engine for them. Dino was a collaboration between Ferrari and Fiat, which elevated both Italian car brands to new heights.\n\nFerrari Dino 246 GT\n\nThe Dino 246 GT was introduced at the Turin Auto Show in 1969, however, production already began beforehand with high expectations and anticipation for success.\n\nUnder the hood, there is a transversely mounted V6 engine that produces 195 horsepower that is manually operated with five gears, a real pleasure. The Dino offered competition to the Porsche 911 and was commercially successful in the market. Ferrari cars were less competitive with the 911, given the even higher segment in which they operated.\n\nThe interior is very Italian: fashionable, elegant, and designed with an eye for the smallest detail. ‘Less is more’ sets the tone. The seats are finished in fine beige leather and hint at sportiness. The dashboard emphasizes Italian performance with a sporty steering wheel and a dashboard with numerous gauges.\n\nJust over 1,000 examples of the 246 GT were built. The fine design and the Ferrari-unusual V6 engine are very popular. The Dino 246 GT is the dream car of many Ferrari enthusiasts.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 424 (167 inch)\nWidth (cm): 170 (67 inch)\nHeight (cm): 114 (45 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 234 (92 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1080 (2381 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: transversal 2491 cc V6 rear-engine\nValve gear: 12, DOHC\nFuel system: 3 Weber carburettors\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 195 hp (143 kW) at 7600 t/m\ntorque: 225 Nm at 5500 t/m\nTop speed: 235 km/h (146 mph)"}
{"name": "1990 MERCEDES-BENZ 500 SL - €24,950 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 129161 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Both a tribute to the past and a pioneer in modern Mercedes-Benz design\nMost powerful engine in its series\nAMG rims\nCanadian vehicle that was brought to Belgium\n \n\nThe Mercedes-Benz R129 was a series of luxury coupes that succeeded the revered R107 series. This new series also came with a lot of superstar glamour. It came in a wide range of various engines, and was produced for thirteen years on end, from 1989 to 2001. Like its ancestors, the Gullwing, the Pagoda, and the R107, the R129 quickly gained the cult status it deserved.\n\nIn 1989, discontinued the R107 series and decided to succeed it by a new series called the R129. However, this replacement was not the true end of the R107 as it still is a coveted classic nowadays. The R129 is an equally sporty, if not sportier compared to its predecessors, and Mercedes-Benz’ characteristics were embodied in it as well: the design is contemporary, and it came with innovative technologies. Just some of these technologies were an electrified automatic convertible system, a safety-enhancing automatically deploying rollover bar in the event of an accident, even a very innovative driving position system was installed in the seats. Besides that, the R129 was available in various engine finishes, as it had been this way before. People could change in a range of engines that went from a 12-valve six-cylinder engine to a 48-valve V12. Though all engines had their own charm and all of them were impressively performant.\n\nThe angulated design typifies Mercedes-Benz’ nineties style which was also retained after facelifts in 1995 and 1998. However, these facelifts brought some visible distinctions, the most noticeable being the cases of the turn signals, which were no longer orange but coloured with the transparent headlights. From 1998, each cylinder was powered with two spark plugs in order to achieve an even smoother and more efficient combustion with maximum efficiency.\n\nThe R129 is a tribute, and a continuation of the past of Mercedes-Benz' classy and powerful coupes. At the same time, its new technology shows preparedness for the future.\n\nMercedes 500 SL\n\nThe 500 SL was released as being the flagship of the R129 series that was first shown to the world in 1989. Its powertrain must be the most noteworthy as this car is powered by a 5.0L V8 that makes the car able to accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometres per hour (0-60 mph) in only six seconds.

{"name": "1979 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL MKV - €8,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The Lincoln Continental was produced from 1940 to 2020 by Ford's Lincoln division. There were 10 different generations. The first three represented the optimum of luxury at Ford, until the early 1980s, when it was replaced in this role by the Lincoln Town Car. The Continental then became a simple sedan, even adopting the Ford Taurus platform in 1988. Its production ceased in 2002, when it was replaced by the Lincoln LS, then by the Lincoln MKS. In March 2015, an all-new Continental was revealed in New York to replace the MKS; it was put on the market in 2016, in the 2017 vintage. During production, the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental (offered here) was sold in two versions, with a major overhaul in 1975. Following the downsizing of the General Motors and Chrysler product lines, the Lincoln Continental was released. became the largest mass-produced automobile in the world for the 1977 model year. It was only surpassed by special limousines, such as the long-wheelbase version of the Mercedes-Benz 600, the Rolls-Royce Phantom VI and ZIL-4104. Following the reduction in sales of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis in 1979, the Lincoln Continental was marketed as the last \"traditional\" or \"large\" sedan in the United States."}

{"name": "1988 ALPINE GTA D501-100 V6 - €15,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The Alpine GTA was introduced as the successor to the Alpine A310 in 1984. Alpine have a really unique style, which is their greatest strength, and it is once again emphasized in this futuristic, almost space-age sports car, that has been designed as if it had travelled from the future to the past. It is the first Alpine to be fully built under Renault’s supervision, the goal was clear: to provide French competition to Porsche's 911 and 944, not an easy task.\n\nIn an era when Porsche's immense success intimidated, even threatened all car manufacturers, Alpine were the brave to directly challenge it. In 1984, they introduced the GTA, a four-seater coupe with a futuristic look and a sleek design. Its futuristic design made it able to be aerodynamic, and not just a little bit – objectively. It was actually ‘one of the most aerodynamic cars available’. on top of that, it was incredibly fast. Additionally, it was the first Alpine built under the complete control of Renault; previously, Alpine had been merely a subsidiary of Renault that mostly used Renault components.\n\nUnder the hood of this time-travelled machine resides the well-known 2.9-litre PRV engine, a V6 that was developed in a collaboration between Renault, Peugeot, and Volvo, which had previously earned its place in other equally futuristic cars like the DMC DeLorean.\n\nThe futuristic theme continues inside as well. The center console continues to the back seat and the ‘interactive’ dashboard features gauges and meters that enhance the driving experience even further. The gear stick is uniquely positioned to the left on the center console, the stalwart steering wheel hints at sportiness, and the door panels are pragmatically equipped with ‘Alpine’-branded speakers. Undoubtedly, the racetrack is this car’s hometown, nevertheless, it is very fit to daily traffic.\n\nOver the years, various variants appear, including a turbocharged model with a smaller 2.4-litre engine and a few limited-edition versions. Due to changes in regulations, the car was equipped with a catalytic converter from 1987 onwards. In 1991, production stops and the GTA is succeeded by the A610.\n\nAlpine GTA V6 Turbo\n\nThe Alpine GTA V6 Turbo, or 'D501 05' for Europe and 'D50 A' for the United States, was built shortly after the first anniversary of Alpine and their GTA. It featured a smaller 2.4-liter engine but was equipped with a turbocharger that avoided power loss, eventually power was even increased adding this turbo.\n\nThe Alpine GTA V6 Turbo is a rare car, not too many people have heard of it, making it special. It is the perfect vintage car for enthusiasts who adore French temperament in a sporty package.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 433 (170 inch)\nWidth (cm): 175 (69 inch)\nHeight (cm): 120 (47 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 234 (92 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1210 (2668 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: Turbocharged 2458 cc mid-engine V6\nValve gear: 12\nFuel system: Renix MPI\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 197 hp (147 kW) at 5750 t/m\ntorque: 285 Nm at 2500 t/m\nTop speed: 250 km/h (155 mph)"}

Both cars employed the same 6750 cc Rolls-Royce V8 engine, as used in the outgoing Bentley T2 and Silver Shadow II models.\n\nThe Bentley variant however, received a welcome power boost in 1982, with the launch of the Mulsanne Turbo at that year’s Geneva Motor Show. The addition of a Garrett turbocharger gave a claimed 50% increase in power and pushed the claimed top speed to a limited 135mph. The Mulsanne Turbo remained in production until 1985, by which time a little over 500 examples of the model had been made.\n\nThis car was originally supplied new in the UK by Bentley main dealer Mann Egerton. It was then brought to Jersey (where it was chauffeur driven for one owner) before being sold in 2008 to a new Guernsey-based owner. The car returned to Jersey ownership in 2021. It has had very little use since moving to Guernsey, at which point the mileage was around 39,000. \n\nThere is a comprehensive service history with the car – it details nine Bentley dealer-provided services up until the year 2000 at 32,686 miles. Thereafter, it was maintained by independent garages until 2006, when it returned to the local (Jersey) Bentley dealership with instructions to fix whatever was needed. The last service record is dated 2019, with 41,735 miles logged. In 2022 the car had 4 new tyres fitted; the air conditioning system was overhauled and a new battery fitted. The vehicle runs and drives very well. \n\nThe Bentley’s bodywork is corrosion free and in very good order. The original Royal Blue paintwork is in fine condition.\n\nThe typically luxurious interior boasts walnut veneered fascia and door cappings, cream leather upholstery piped with blue and dark blue wool carpeting. Generally in very good condition, although there is some wear to the veneered parts commensurate with the car’s age.\n\nThis is a relatively rare Bentley model with more than adequate performance, which has been well cared for and relatively little used during its life.\n\nThe car has now been re-registered in Jersey and we can assist with shipping and importation processes if required. We can ship worldwide."}

Originally owned by a US Army serviceman stationed in the Netherlands, later being sold to another US Military man who has owned her for the last 20 years.\n\nThe 911 SC (Super Carrera) from this era is renowned for its robust air-cooled, flat-six engine, known for reliability and great performance. The 1982 model, part of the 911's G-series, features a 3.0-liter engine, delivering a balanced mix of power and agility, making it a joy to drive.\n\nThis particular car, after changing hands to a fellow Army colleague, found a long-term home with his wife, who has preserved it for two decades. Its exterior and interior conditions are expected to reflect the high standards of maintenance typical in military care. The car's paint, trim, and overall aesthetics might still shine with the luster of a well-preserved classic. Restoration works have been carried out but nothing offensive, all in keeping with the original car.\n\nThe 911 SC's interior, retaining its original features, would offer a classic and straightforward layout, with comfort and functionality at its core. It's equipped with features typical of the early '80s Porsches, such as supportive seats, a functional dashboard, and the classic Porsche steering wheel.\n\nMechanically, the car's maintenance by its military-affiliated owners suggests a vehicle in excellent condition, with regular servicing and attention to detail. This level of care is crucial for a vehicle of this age and pedigree, ensuring its longevity and performance.\n\nIn summary, the 1982 Porsche 911 SC is a well-maintained, well looked after desirable Porsche. Its military-associated ownership adds a unique aspect to its story, making it a cherished vehicle for collectors or enthusiasts who value both performance and a well-documented past."}

{"name": "2001 MITSUBISHI EVO VI - £100,000 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This lot will be auctioned via Iconic Auctioneers, Race Retro Classic and Competition Car Sale 2024 on Saturday the 24th of February, Stoneleigh Park, Stoneleigh Rd, Coventry, CV8 2LG. Launched at the peak of rally mania, Mitsubishi experienced huge success in Lancer Evolution sales, reportedly selling 6,000 Evolution IVs in the first three days of its launch! The 1996 WRC season brought Mitsubishi its first World Rally Championship drivers’ title, with thanks to a blisteringly quick driver named Tommi Makinen.\nIn quick succession, the Lancer Evolution VI came to be and, in the latter-half of 1999, Mitsubishi unleashed a special edition to celebrate its favourite driver’s four consecutive WRC drivers’ titles from 1996-1999; the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI 'Tommi Makinen Edition (TME). The Evolution VI was already a technological tour-de-force but the TME came equipped with a more responsive titanium turbocharger, uprated and lowered suspension, quicker steering, an upgraded exhaust, a new ECU, beefed-up transfer case internals, a redesigned front bumper for improved cooling and authentic 17-inch WRC Enkei alloy wheels. The interior featured embossed Recaro seats, a MOMO steering wheel and red stitching. The performance upgrades saw 0-60mph despatched in 4.4 seconds and a maximum top speed of 150mph. Power was rumoured to be north of 300bhp, rather than the 276bhp 'Gentleman’s agreement'.\nOffered here is the rarest of all the Tommi Makinen derivatives and often regarded as the last of the true homologation specials. Ralliart UK planned to produce a limited run of twelve cars to celebrate Tommi Makinen’s unprecedented third win on the Monte Carlo Rally but, in fact, only five cars were built, this being Number #5.\nThe RS Monte Carlo edition started life as a standard competition RS model before the Ralliart Technical Team, headed by WRC Mitsubishi Works principal Toney Cox, applied their extensive knowledge to produce the ultimate Mitsubishi Evo. It was fitted with the renowned Ralliart UK Stage 1 engine performance pack providing stunning acceleration, improved throttle response and overall drivability. The uprated suspension was enhanced with specially developed Eibach springs which, with revised geometry, provided improved handling and the 'Monte Carlo' was equipped with the competition close-ratio gearbox and a Group N rally-specification front helical differential. The interior benefitted from Recaro SR front seats with the rear seats and doors trimmed in a matching fabric.\nFirst registered to Ralliart UK Ltd. on 11th July 2001, Number#5 was subsequently sold to its one and only owner on 17th August 2001 with only 71 miles indicated, and today the odometer reads just 3,497 miles. The history file contains a copy of the original RS Monte Carlo press release from Mitsubishi Motor Sports and Ralliart and the original invoice to our owner. Essentially still factory fresh, Monte Carlo #5 has recently been checked over by a renowned rally preparation business and represents the final opportunity to own a pristine example of what, in our opinion, is the ultimate Evo."}

Lovers of the wide-body 911 had to wait a long time after the cessation of the 911 3.2 range before a Turbo-look Porsche with a naturally aspirated engine was offered. The spectacular 964 Carrera 2 Cabriolet Turbo-look (named “America Roadster” for the US market), appeared in 1982. This independent model of the 964 series was built in model year 1982 and 1993. The line of the closed roof was finally in tandem with the body line and the chassis and braking system from the 964 Turbo 3.3 were utilised for its production.\n\nThe 964 range represented the first modernisation of the 911 and is, by most measures, the most technically advanced whist still retaining the raw, classic sports car look and feeling of the original air-cooled 911 series. Porsche claimed that 85% of the parts used in the new 964 range were new, with notable changes such as the M64 3.6 litre engine, coil springs, ABS braking, air bags, power steering, a retractable rear spoiler, and re-engineered heating and air conditioning systems. The 3.6 litre engine had an output of 250 bhp and gave the car a 0-60 mph acceleration time of just 5.5 seconds.\n\nOur Carrera 2 Cabriolet Turbo-look was purchased new from Porsche Tokyo, Japan, by a Porsche collector in March 1992, and they kept up the dealer servicing up until 2019, when it was brought over to the UK. The car has benefitted from a recent full major Porsche specification service, brake fluid service, Dunlop tyres, new front brake discs and pads, underside clean, machine polish and detailing.

This AC Superblower is powered by a supercharged Ford 5.0 litre 302 V8 engine, putting 355 bhp at the driver's disposal. A maximum torque figure of 385 lb/ft @ 3,750 rpm is equally impressive.

The production of the Cygnet was discontinued in 2013 after a relatively short run.\nThe decision to discontinue the Cygnet was likely influenced by its niche market, pricing, and the evolving priorities of Aston Martin.\nWhile the Aston Martin Cygnet may not have been a commercial triumph, it remains a curious footnote in the brand's history, showcasing the challenges and experimentation luxury automakers face in adapting to changing market demands and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe production time of Aston Martin Cygnet was between ~5/2011 and ~9/2013. In September 2013 Aston Martin decided to stop the production of the Cygnets because of too low sales numbers.

{"name": "1974 PORSCHE 911 2.7 MFI - £POA ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "UNDER OFFER! PORSCHE 911 CARRERA 2.7 MFI TARGA, 1974, 82,500 MILES, FULLY RESTORED, GEMINI BLUE METALLIC WITH BEIGE LEATHERETTE & TWILL INSERTS FACTORY SPECIFICATION: - 915 5-SPEED MANUAL GEARBOX, METALLIC PAINT, TARGA FOLDING ROOF, REAR SPOILER, TINTED GLASS, INTERMITTENT WIPER CONTROL, IMPACT BUMPERS, CHROME TRIM OPTION. NEW PORSCHE CLASSIC SAT NAV RADIO AND BODY DECALS FITTED. Hexagon Classics are delighted to offer this desirable, fully restored 911 Carrera 2.7 MFI Targa, a car which we know extremely well. This 2.7 has been the subject of a fastidious 3-year restoration by Hexagon's Porsche factory-trained master technicians, paint shop and trimmers to produce an example of the rare Carrera 2.7 Targa that is truly second-to-none. Whereas the first Carrera RS 2.7 had only been offered in a coupe body, for the 1974 model year it was available in both coupe and Targa bodies. One of the best-kept secrets in the 911 story, this 2.7 was the top model of a three-car line-up. An extremely rare Porsche indeed.The new G-series, as it became known, was produced between September 1973 and July 1975. The horizontally opposed air-cooled six-cylinder 2,687 cc engine could produce an impressive 210 bhp at 6,300 rpm. 0 - 60 mph was achieved in 5.5 secs and the car could reach 150 mph. These new Carreras had headrests integrated into the seat tops, three-spoke sport steering wheels and electric front windows. Porsche used Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection to improve efficiency and emissions, the stylish 15\" Fuchs alloy wheels remained, and impact-absorbing bumpers, rear reflector and deeper sills were added. The rear tail and front lip spoiler were made from a softer rubber compound to comply with German safety legislation, and the vented brake discs from the RS were standard.The steering is superb, light enough at parking speeds, direct and responsive on the move, with just the right amount of castor action and feedback over bumps. The cornering powers are so good that very few owners will dare to explore the limits of adhesion in the dry on public roads. Using the Porsche mantra of \"slow in, fast out\", the Carrera 2.7 Targa comes into its own. The ability to enjoy open-air motoring is a wonderful bonus. Sharing the same MFI engine as the much-admired 2.7 RS, these cars offer an affordable alternative but without the large price tag.Completed at the factory on October 1974, our Targa was first supplied by Porsche Cars Great Britain in November 1974. The history file contains the Porsche CoA, wonderful period invoices, historic MOT's and handbooks. Now carefully run in, serviced and ready to enjoy.Available for inspection at our London showrooms."}

{"name": "1972 ALFA ROMEO 2000 GTV - £59,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This original UK supplied matching numbers Alfa Romeo GT Veloce is not only the most original example we have ever come across, but also without doubt the very best we have seen in over 30 years in the industry. OYJ 451K first came to us last year and was driven to us from Norfolk covering 200 absolutely faultless miles, arriving with a warranted 31,500 miles from new with a wonderful, detailed history to include original service book, early service invoices, MOT records and general maintenance invoices throughout its life. Having been recently with one of our Somerset based regular customers, this stunning Alfa returns with 32,000 warranted miles.\nOYJ 451K was supplied new by Hamilton Brothers Limited of Glasgow Road Paisley on the 1st May 1972 to a Scottish gentleman of Italian descent, a Mr Seve Barbieri who kept the Alfa for an impressive 33 years, only selling the car in 2005 due to an end to his driving days. The cars first owner cherished the car and covered almost 23,000 miles during his ownership. The cars original service book records maintenance and stamps at 6424, 11150, 15574, 19977 and 22436 miles. Original Shell service reports from the 1970's are also on file at 752, 2987, 6424 and 9491 miles.\n\nDuring the later years with its first owner, the Alfa was maintained by the Chairman of the Scottish section of the Alfa Romeo Club who also owns Alfa Specialists CP Garage Services in Dundee. To this day, they still specialise in the service of Alfa Romeos and have an excellent reputation built on word of mouth within Alfa Romeo Club circles. In 2005, the very man, the Alfa Romeo trained proprietor of CP Garage Services purchased the car for himself and owned it until 2014 having taken the mileage to 29,000, service book stamped at 27505 with four other services also recorded by CP Garage Services. The Alfa was then purchased by a London based collector and enthusiast with a collection of first class, highly original low mileage cars.\n\nIt was in early 2015 the Alfa Romeo was sent to Alfa Supremo Ian Ellis for a full evaluation and £10,000 of work was carried out on the car to include new tyres, re-furbished wheels, re-conditioned starter motor, rebuilt cylinder head, engine mounts, new clutch, front and rear brake pads, lower ball joints and wishbone bushes, boot seal and boot mat set. The cars London owner later sold the car for it then to be maintained by Alfa specialists Automeo for its next owner who fitted two new weber carburettors and new ignition items, valuing the car at £65000 in 2021 and stating it was corrosion free and the best example they had worked on in 30 years as Alfa specialists. Having regretted selling the car, the London based collector who purchased the Alfa in 2015 bought the car back in 2021 and the car came to us after minimal use on fine days only with just 31500 miles from new. Since then a further faultless 500 miles have been covered.\n\nThis incredibly correct car is truly sensational and remarkably original, a perfect purchase for the discerning collector with its superbly documented full history and warranted low miles. The Cava Beige paintwork is of an excellent standard and the bodywork first class with exceptional original straight panels and structurally outstanding underside having had Ziebart injection treatment in its early life. The largely original upholstery is impressive, as is the well-presented engine bay. This early GTV 2000 displays its Tipo 105.22 and Bertone body number stampings on the boot scuttle, retains its original manufacturers rear window sticker and of course retains its impressive unrepeatable early history. This unrestored car is equally impressive on the road as demonstrated on its original 200-mile drive here, it feels tight, responsive, rattle and shake free and offers and first class driving experience with its top quality low mileage running gear. This is a true collector's piece and offers a unique opportunity to own one of the very best original examples in existence."}

The majority of the past 22 years in the UK has been with one family, and since 2003 the RV8 has covered 27000 miles. Our Woodcote Green MGRV8 has been well maintained with various invoices on file over the years, but it's the recent expenditure which is a great selling point.\n\nWhen down in Essex with our long term customer, the MG was treated to new brake calipers, discs and pads, new fuel pump, pre and main fuel filter, clutch slave cylinder, clutch pipes, new sump gasket, new shock absorbers front and rear, new alternator and belts, new carbon fibre belt pulley, new stainless steel exhaust, two stainless catalytic converters, two new Lambda probes, all new silicone hoses amongst various other service items. Needless to say after this work, the MG was absolutely on the button, ready to go in excellent mechanical condition. Since being in the North East its been used very occasionally, and returns to us exactly as it left.\n\nOn the road the MG is a delight with impressive power and performance from the fit, healthy and superb sounding V8. The five speed gearbox excellent to use, and handling and braking superb after the recent program of work. The MG presents well with a lovely consistent Woodcote Green paint finish. The bodywork is excellent, the car structurally superb underneath and the original Beige leather upholstery is in lovely order throughout, as is the hood. Our MG offers excellent value and will prove a great buy for its next owner."}

This example is a 1.3 GLS Aeroback in Silver that has covered 48600 miles over its 34 years. It has had only 3 owners and was first registered on August 1st 1989. Proton cars went on UK sale in only February of that year. The most recent registered owner was a company that supplied action vehicles for the TV & film industry. They acquired the car in 2015. From a Google search of its registration number it has clearly been a starring car on Emmerdale, Brassic and on a BBC drama about homelessness, 'Men Who Sleep In Cars', where it was the character car for the part played by Cesare Taurasi. There are google screen shots of it on set below. Most recently it has appeared in Aldi's 2023 online Christmas marketing campaign.\n\nThis car is in remarkable condition and has clearly had an easy life. The only non original items fitted are the aftermarket wheel trims. It drives very well with the Mitsubishi 1300 engine being a willing performer and the 5 speed gearbox providing slick changes.\n\nSpecification is gloriously basic with minimal items to go wrong. It has its original Blaupunkt radio, UK importer fitted Webasto sliding sunroof, analogue clock, mud flaps and a full size spare wheel. It does not have PAS, ABS, central locking, electric windows or even internally adjustable mirrors; I'm not sure that it even has an ECU?!\n\nNo service history has been passed on to us but in recent years it has clearly had a new exhaust system and tyres. The MOT is until January 2024 and it is HPI clear. We have given it an oil service and replaced spark plugs, cambelt & tensioner, clutch, fan belt, front brake pads and tailgate struts as part of our preparation.  \n\nThis is a great chance to acquire one of the earliest UK Proton models that is still in very original condition. Inexpensive reliable retro motoring is this cars appeal and it always draws attention at classic shows and meets.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to get in touch with your interest."}

He immediately appealed as is it's very clear that what you see is what you get. Other than his wheels being touched-up, everything is absolutely original and un-molested. The chassis is probably the cleanest you’d ever find for the age - it's never required a single patch and certainly no replacement sections such as the crossmember. In fact the chassis is so good it still has lots of it's original paint in-tact. As you’d expect; the bulkhead is in similarly good order. The bodywork is beautifully straight. The paintwork does have some very minor blemishes at rear panel edges but what I find particularly appealing is that the smart Caledonian Blue finish has never had so much as a touch-up pen near it in what would be a crude attempt to mask anything. Mechanically, Chris has been extremely well cared for as the full service history points to including meticulous annual services during the last decade despite only covering approximately 2000 miles each year during this time and a grand total of 105,000 miles to now. The 5-pot engine starts well, runs like a Swiss watch and pulls like a train, the clutch is smooth and bites low in its pedal travel while the gear selection feels positive through the range. Chris steers evenly, brakes precisely and has no noticeable take-up in the drivetrain either under acceleration or on the over-run. While this isn’t in showroom condition it's still a very tidy example of a Defender purchased new from Ripon Farm Services and run commercially during it's early years before being “pensioned-off” for the large majority of it's life with a retired gentleman who kept it only to transport his dogs up a quiet country lane for their daily walk. Life with me has been equally sedate. With a genuine reason for sale now, Chris is full of potential for life with a new owner.

The 2CV6 Charleston featured the 2 cylinder 602cc 'flat-twin' Boxer engine with a 4 speed Gearbox and with a new carburettor, the engine produced 29 bhp (22 kW) and gave the car a top speed of 71 mph (115 km/h).   The 2CV has an Independent McPherson front and rear Coil Spring suspension,15'' Steel Wheels and the 'inboard' front Disc Brakes and rear Drum Brakes.  This lovely Citroen 2CV6 Charleston was first registered in North London on 12th December 1986 and is finished in its original colour scheme of Two Tone Grey with its original Grey velour seats, currently fitted with Pastel Purple seat covers, black rubber matting, a new Grey Vinyl roll-back roof, its original 602cc 2-Cylinder Engine, 4 Speed Manual Gearbox.  The car has had 8 former keepers from new and has a full and comprehensive service history with a folder containing invoices for servicing and repairs from the late 1980's to date, its original Citroen Handbook pack, MOT certificates from its first one in 1989, clear HPI check, Citroen Deux Chevaux Car Club documents and magazines, a number of old Tax Discs and 2  sets of keys.  Very importantly, the car had a new Chassis fitted by Citroen dealer Crayford Motors Ltd in October 2001 and it appears from the MOT history that the car was not used between 2013 and 2019. It was it was re-MOT'd in April 2019 @ 49,163 miles and was then sold to the current owner in June 2019.

The car has now covered a genuine and very low 51,694 Miles from new and it really is in excellent condition throughout and needs to be seen and driven to be fully appreciated.

{"name": "1967 ALFA ROMEO 1600 DUETTO SPIDER LHD - £39,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 8293 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Light, nimble, and attractive are some of the words that can be used to describe Alfa Romeo’s Spiders and that philosophy held true right through the whole range from the Giulietta Spider in 1954 right through to the last Series 4 Spider in 1994. As successors to the Giulietta and Giulia Spiders from the 50's and early 60's, the new Alfa Romeo Spider introduced in 1966 remained in production for almost three decades in various guises. The first three series were assembled by Pininfarina in Grugliasco, Italy and the fourth series in San Giorgio Canavese in Italy. The last S4 Spider was manufactured in April 1993 and was the last 'rear-wheel drive Alfa Romeo' before the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione of 2007. In 1966, Alfa Romeo introduced the successor to the Giulia Spider with a 'write-in' competition to decide the name. Even though the winning entry was 'Duetto', the manufacturer faced trademark issues and was forced to rename the car the Alfa Romeo Spider 1600. Only 6,324 examples of the 'Duetto' Spider 1600 were produced and this car is one of them. According to Alfa Romeo's Certificato di Origine, this very nice LHD 1600 Spider (105.03) - Chassis # AR665800 and Engine No: AR00526/A*S647A was built in Italy on 29th August 1967 and was exported to Newark, New Jersey in the USA. The delivery/registration date is recorded as being March 1st 1968 and it is finished in its original colour scheme of Rosso Red with a Skai Nero (Black) interior. The Alfa Romeo museum have stated that the Engine number was not recorded on the vehicle record (not unusual for Alfa Romeo), but we are sure that it does have its original and matching engine.  Unfortunately, nothing is known of its life in the USA, but it was shipped to the UK in 1989 and was first registered here on 17th November 1989. We were informed by the previous owner, who bought the car from Alfa specialist Lombarda in Notting Hill in July 1997, that the car had just been restored by them and it is fair was in fantastic condition when we sold the car for him to the current owner 13 years later in December 2010. He took the car to his villa in Marbella, Spain in May 2011 and it has been in Spain for the last 12 years. It was hardly driven at all during its time on the Costa Del Sol, so he decided it was time to sell the car and it was shipped back to London this summer and just given back to us to sell for him. Prior to transporting the car back, it was fully recommissioned by English Classic Car Specialist Michael Owen Sissons in Estepona and works included a complete new exhaust system, a new set of tyres, service including new plugs, oils and filters, brake fluid change, brake overhaul with new caliper seals, brake pads and hoses, overhaul of both carburettors, water pump, petrol pump, cooling system hoses, drive belts and more with a total spend of €3,105.89 (£2,700). We are just in the process of preparing the car for sale and a full set of photographs and a video will follow shortly. Upon sale, the car will come with a new MOT and our own standard 6 months Mechanical Breakdown Parts & Labour Warranty. This car is of course Road Tax Free, MOT exempt & ULEZ compliant.

This contemporary and luxurious, yet sporty, German sportscar was released in 1963. To this day, they are still being produced in large numbers, also a range of variants has been developed to mimic a tailor-made product range. Although the 911 has been refined over the decades, the basic design – which is recognisable and thus sublime – has generally remained unchanged. This pragmatic and contemporary approach only Porsche could ever succeed in.\n\nThe 911 is the successor to the Porsche 356 and was designed by Ferdinand Porsche - the grandson of Porsche’s founder – and presented at the Frankfurt Auto Show in the autumn of 1963. In 1964, the first models were delivered to customers, and due to its great success, the 911 was soon expanded: a cheaper 912, a faster 911S and the rollbar equipped and extremely safe convertible Targa were released. This Targa was named after a Sicilian race that was year by year won by Porsche.\n\nInitially, this car would be called the Porsche 901, but Peugeot became the headwind as their models were named by a three-digit number with a 0 in the middle. “Don’t worry”, said Porsche and they replaced the 0 with a 1. The Porsche 911 was born! After that, there was still Porsche cars built that were named with a three-digit number with a 0 in the middle, however those were exclusively intended for racing and circuit purposes, not for public roads.\n\nUndoubtedly, the 911 has been modified over the years; as durable a design may be, times change, and cars do too. Porsche has always been prepared for changes and innovation. They gradually increased the engine displacement, the power and the size. The biggest mechanical change was the transition from air cooled engines to water cooled engine. Water cooled engines ensure an evenly cooled engine, which results in uniform combustion. This results in lower consumption and less emission.\n\nPorsche 911 SC\n\nIn 1978, the Porsche 911 SC was revealed as being the last 911 (maybe). This is reflected in its model name, as SC stands for ‘Super Carrera’, as they wanted to finish this series with a climax. At Porsche, there was some doubt about whether to continue the 911 series, as the intended successor, the 928, had already entered the ‘Porsche flagship fray’, if we may. However, the 928 never managed to match the 911's fame.\n\nThe 911 SC didn't bring many changes, which is perfectly fine. Initially, there was a targa or a coupe, as usual, in 1983, the first 911 cabriolet was brought to life. There was a wide package of options, which gave customers more freedom of choice. This was well received as the SC was considered an ‘entry-level’ and ‘alternative’ option to the Turbo. The iconic ‘whale tail’ and the - also iconic - Fuchs rims were the main features of this options package. Customers could also opt for a blue and red paint scheme - ‘Martini edition’ - that was available due to Porsche's circuit successes.\n\nAll doubt got left behind, Porsche decided not to stop 911 production, the car had become a real icon. Nowadays, the car remains very popular, thus it is a highly sought-after car. There’s even big community of 911 aficionados, ensuring its rocketing market demand.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 429 (169 inch)\nWidth (cm): 165 (65 inch)\nHeight (cm): 132 (52 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 227 (89 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1190 (2624 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 2994 cc flat-six air-cooled rear-engine\nValve gear: 12\nFuel system: Bosch K-Jetronic\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 204 hp (152 kW) at 5900 t/m\ntorque: 267 Nm at 4300 t/m\nTop speed: 227 km/h (141 mph)"}

{"name": "1971 ASTON MARTIN DB2 THE EX’ JOHN ETHERIDGE ASTON MARTIN DBR2 RECREATION - £POA ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 668 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "THE Ex’ JOHN ETHERIDGE ASTON MARTIN DBR2 RECREATION\n\nBuilt between 1988 and 1991, this highly detailed and professionally recreated DBR2 was the brainchild of the late John R Etheridge, an Aston Martin works Experimental Division engineer from 1956 onward and member of the race team.\n\nHaving wished for many years, since his time in the works racing department, to build for himself a DBR2, Etheridge’s opportunity came in 1990 when, with financial backing from F1 race entrants Safir Engineering, construction of this wonderful recreation started in the workshops of J. R. Etheridge Engineering Ltd, in Bushey Heath, London,\n\nAn original 1957 ‘Works’ DBR2, DBR2/2, maintained by Etheridge, was made available by the then owner, for detailed technical analysis and reverse engineering. A new tubular steel chassis, faithful to the original, was constructed and a new body buck made (included in the sale) enabling the aluminium body panels, to be fabricated. Built to the original configuration and keeping to the original design principles, including the use of Aston Martin parts, the completed car was first seen in public in 1991.\n\nAs with the original DBR2’s, the Tadek Marek designed Aston Martin DB4 engine, to 4.0 litre capacity, is fitted and carries a cylinder head identified with DP5057/2 stampings. DP5057 being the official engine project number for DBR2, the /2 denoting this cylinder head as being the second ‘project’ cylinder head, built up and fitted in 1957 to DBR2/2.\n\nCommenting after inspecting the car in 1990, Ted Cutting, former Aston Martin Engineering Director 1949-1964, wrote to Etheridge, ‘you’ve done a great job. I’d go so far as to say that the car you’ve built, I’d have been proud to have done myself!’\n\nThe highly effective DBR2’s, of which only 2 were built, successfully raced in 1957 and 1958 as Works entries, with DBR2/1 and DBR2/2 being driven by Works drivers, Stirling Moss, Roy Salvadori, Tony Brooks and Paul Frere. With outright wins and new lap records set in Goodwood’s Sussex Trophy race, at Silverstone in the BRDC meeting and in the Empire Trophy race at Oulton Park during the ‘57 and ’58 seasons. Other races entered with the DBR2, included the Le Mans 24hrs in 1957. Retired from international sportscar racing by 1959, due to a new 3.0 litre engine size limit being imposed by the regulators, both original DBR/2’s were successfully campaigned by Carroll Shelby in the USA, before being sold off. Now in significant collectors’ hands, the two original DBR2’s are conservatively valued in excess of $20 million each.\n\nThis exceptional recreated DBR2, 1 of 1 built, was retained by Etheridge until 1995, when the car was sold to the late, racer and notable Aston Martin collector, Robert Leyba in Germany. Etheridge’s DBR2, forming part of Leyba’s sizeable collection, which at that time was the largest Aston Martin collection in Europe, was used occasionally on road events, before being sold at the inaugural Bonhams Aston Martin auction in 2000, achieving almost double the auctioneers estimate. The last owner, a Belgian collector, professionally stored and enjoyed the car occasionally, over the last 20 years.\n\nUK road registered and carrying 1971 Aston Martin vehicle identity, this exceptional car is simply wonderful and fast to drive. Eligible for many historic road rally events and with some level of modification, could be made to comply with FIA HTP regulations, applicable for International historic racing. Finished in period Aston Martin racing green, the car is trimmed and finished in original and correct period materials and fitted with the correct period instrumentation, layout and switchgear.\n\nAvailable for viewing now at our Hertfordshire showrooms.\n\nNotes on the constructor, John R Etheridge (1941 -2014):\n\nEtheridge’s credentials need little introduction, save to say that after serving his years employed in Experimental Division and racing activities of Aston Martin, he in 1963, at the personal invitation of John Wyer, joined Ford Motor Co’s highly successful Advance Vehicle Operations team, to build and race the all-conquering Ford GT40’s. A heroic story well told, in 2019 Hollywood blockbuster, Ford v Ferrari. Wyer always opined that John was one of his finest racing mechanics.\n\nAt the end of Fords GT40 racing programme, Etheridge teamed up with established race car manufacturer Safir Engineering and John Wyer’s automotive business in acquiring from the Ford Motor Co in Dearborn, a licence to build and further run 40 Ford GT40 MkV’s, now in collections worldwide.\n\nIn 1968 he set up his own company specialising in Aston Martins, Ferrari’s and the Ford GT40. His workshops always looked more akin to hospital operating theatres than any garage – such were his standards.\n\nDBR2 Recreation - Outline Specifications\n\nChassis:-Tubular Steel, central ‘Back Bone’ structure.\n\nBody:-Aluminium alloy, hand formed using body buck (included)\n\nEngine: Aston Martin DB4. 4.0 litre capacity, 6 cyl.

{"name": "1980 MORGAN 4/4 - €29,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Completely hand-built\nFlashy paint job and fitting interior colours\nCar with the longest production run ever, according to Morgan\n \n\nMorgan is a British family-run business that was established in 1910. Each car they build is built by hand, which makes them unique and distinguishing in the entire automotive industry. The ‘Morgan family’ does not want their production to be automated, their team of approx. 200 seasoned craftsmen create masterpieces that exude British craftsmanship and personality.\n\nMorgan initially only built tricycles, as the taxes in the UK on tricycles were considerably lower than on automobiles. In 1910, they brought a single-seater trike to the market. Only a modest number of orders was made, nevertheless, Morgan decided to produce a two-seater variant. This two-seater sold a lot more models, which caused him to continue his business.\n\nIn 1936, the company repositioned itself and began the production of four-wheel driven vehicles. Under the pre-war was a four-cylinder inline engine delivering just 34 horsepower. This early Morgan car was named ‘4/4’, referring to the four-cylinder engine driving four wheels. Over the decades, new models were based on this Morgan's first four-wheeler. New engines were used, though, the basic design remained very similar.\n\nThis prestigious British car brand became a status symbol that acquired global fame. Today, Morgan is still a well-known car manufacturer. Their artisanal approach is unique, and they are virtually the only ones who manufacture cars entirely by hand.\n\nMorgan 4/4\n\nAs mentioned, the Morgan 4/4 has been traditionally hand-built since 1936. Production of this Morgan's first four-wheeler continued uninterrupted until 2018, making it the longest-produced car ever.\n\nThe 4/4 is unmistakably very typical to Morgan’s style and easily recognizable, even from miles away. Even the old models are surprisingly hard to distinguish from the new ones. Its design is timeless, although what lies under the hood has changed over the decades. The 4/4 has also undergone a few subtle aesthetic changes, which we can easily forgive.\n\nMorgans are undeniably iconic cars. Each Morgan has a unique story, thanks to the exceptional service that Morgan consistently provides, and that is why they are sought-after classics.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 366 (144 inch)\nWidth (cm): 142 (56 inch)\nHeight (cm): 129 (51 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 244 (96 inch)\nWeight (kg): 735 (1620 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: four-cylinder 1585 cc front-engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: 1 Weber carburettor\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nRight-steered\npower: 97 hp (72 kW) at 6000 t/m\ntorque: 118 Nm at 3800 t/m\nTop speed: 170 km/h (106 mph)"}
{"name": "1988 FERRARI TESTAROSSA '88 - €130,000 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Non-catalysed and manually shifted Italian V12 power, something many enthusiasts can only dream about\nTyping Ferrari’s style and history\nBelgian car\n \n\nThe Ferrari Testarossa was presented at the Paris Auto Show in 1984. Its name was derived from two earlier successful Ferrari racing cars of the 250 series. At the time, it was the production car with the most powerful engine on the market and noticeably only superlatives can do it justice. Sales had been successful - by Ferrari standards, not in millions - though production stopped in 1992, with a total of approximately 7.200 units produced.\n\nThis luxurious sports car was designed by the famous design company Pininfarina, who are based in Turin. It is fair to say that they made this Ferrari a true icon. Regulation in various countries did not allow for large air sucking holes to be built into a car. Pininfarina decided to design air ‘slots’ on the doors of the car. These air slots are nicknamed ‘egg slicers’ and provide the V12 engine with enough oxygen to burn fuel and convert it to Italian horsepower, real horsepower. Initially regular air intakes were designed, but those seem to break the laws in some countries. Thanks to the iconic design of these vents, the Testarossa deserved starring roles in famous TV series like Miami Vice. Rumour has it that famous people such as Elton John, Rod Stewart, and Michael Jordan have one in their garage.\n\nUnder the hood of the Testarossa is an unbelievably high-performance V12 engine of 4943 cc which produces 385 horsepower and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0-60 mph) in less than six seconds. Four valves per cylinder give the power a boost, for a total of 48 valves, which was also ground-breaking at the time. The 48-valve engine is controlled by a manual five-speed gearbox, which creates a driving experience that is typical to Ferrari.\n\nTestarossa is Italian for ‘redhead’ and refers to the similarly named Ferrari racing cars of the 1950s and 1960s, whose names referred to the red painted cylinder heads. Over the years, a few minor adjustments were made to the car. In 1986 and in response to customer demand, a right-hand mirror was installed, as it was not originally present. In 1991, Ferrari unofficially decided to stop production of the Testarossa. The successor would be the 512TR - TR still meaning Testarossa - and was essentially an upgraded Testarossa.\n\nThe Testarossa is a car that only superlatives can describe. It has set the tone for further Ferrari cars and had – at the time – the most powerful engine to be ever made for a production car. This, and its appearance in numerous tv series, make it a very coveted classic among car aficionados.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 449 (177 inch)\nWidth (cm): 198 (78 inch)\nHeight (cm): 113 (44 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 255 (100 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1630 (3594 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 4943 cc V12 mid-engine\nValve gear: 48\nFuel system: Bosch K-Jetronic\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 390 hp (287 kW) at 6300 t/m\ntorque: 480 Nm at 4500 t/m\nTop speed: 290 km/h (180 mph)"}

The Z8 was built to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary 507, and although that 507 nearly spelled trouble for the Bavarian ‘car magicians’, it still is a car that holds a prominent place in the BMW history books as 'iconic.' That same thing is exactly what the Z8 also claims on its list of accomplishments. The 'Z' stands for 'Zukunft', which means 'future' in German, its sleek design proves that it is a very correct name.\n\nAfter revealing flashy prototypes at international auto shows and making some refinements to the design of those revealed prototypes, it was time to unleash the Z8 onto the market. In 1999, the Z8 officially goes into production, the following year it was available for sale, marking the beginning of the new millennium in an extravagant manner. Equipped with the most powerful BMW engine of that time - a naturally aspirated V8 engine from the E39 M5 operated by a manual gearbox - the Z8 has a maximum power output of 400 horsepower and a maximum torque of 500 Nm. With these specifications, it is able to reach a speed of 100 kilometers per hour – 62 miles per hour - from a standstill in less than five seconds. Its top speed it electronically limited at 250 kilometres per hour.\n\nIn addition to its powerful engine, the Z8 offers plenty of luxurious features. There is no option list as the Z8 is a complete package on its own that comes with all the options. Therefore, the interior is fully made in leather, even the roll bar has the leather finish, there is an aluminium-finished steering wheel, the rear window of the hardtop is heated and matches the interior colours, and there even is a button to start and stop the engine.\n\nIt goes without saying, after seeing this car, that the automotive artistry of the Z8 offers architectural beauty in every way. The Z8 is entirely made of aluminium and completely crafted by hand using a new body construction technique called the ‘spaceframe’. Besides that, new-designed neon lights were also used for the Z8’s lighting.\n\nIts appearance in the 1999 James Bond film 'The World is Not Enough' gave it a boost in popularity and cemented its iconic status even before the Z8 hit the market. During its production period from 2000 to 2003, a total of only 5,703 units were built, each one meticulously handmade. The Z8 embodies a holy trinity of rarity, German natural power, and (near-)perfect design, which is why it has captured the hearts of many.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 437 (172 inch)\nWidth (cm): 183 (72 inch)\nHeight (cm): 132 (52 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 250 (98 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1635 (3605 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: V8 4941 cc front-engine\nValve gear: 32\nFuel system: Bosch Motronic\nGear box: 6-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 400 hp (294 kW) at 6600 t/m\ntorque: 500 Nm at 3800 t/m\nTop speed: 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited)"}

No wonder we haven't had one for a few years !\n\nMost of us know that when produced these cars were the most expensive cars in the World - three times the price of a 'normal Silver Shadow' and another 50% more than a Corniche!\n\nSo you could buy a Camargue or three houses (yes that's 3) in Suburbia.......\n\nDesigned by the renowned Italian design house of Pininfarina SpA the looks at the time, and even now, are rather Marmite - you either love them or you hate them\n\nThankfully I have always been a positive sole and can see the beauty of their elegance - as a youngster two of my fathers chums had them (probably the only two in Hadley Wood at the time) and I had the chance to ride in them\n\nIn the mid seventies they really were an unusual vision and sitting in the back (very comfortable by the way) I was amazed at how many jaws dropping you saw from the passing pedestrians, constantly\n\nWhatever the thoughts about her looks, for sure she has serious presence - and still today\n\nRolls-Royce under the guidance of Sir David Plaistow had the vision to bring a car of this type to the market place, and not only did they use Pininfarina to design, they also updated the fascia along the lines of aircraft cockpits\n\nThey considered a lot of their potential buyers would also have their own private aircraft (for when all controls were in their normal settings, all indicators were all perpendicular), so that the driver (pilot) could see all was good from their peripheral vision - not taking their eyes off the road\n\nA brave move on both areas of consideration\n\nThis particular example is finished to original specification, and completely appropriate for the late seventies too, with Regency Bronze exterior complimented with dark green hides to the interior\n\nShe has a full history to validate her 62.500 miles only since new\n\nTwo service voucher booklets (stamped since new with her first service in March 1978), original Camargue instruction manual, a host of invoices from the early eighties onwards as well as many Mot's and various other information in the history folder\n\nIn 2021 at the Salon Prive at Blenheim Palace she won the Manufacturer's Award - enough said !\n\nAs you can see from the photo's she has very straight bodywork with great panel gaps, beautiful paintwork, bright work, interior trim, veneers and carpets. The engine bay and boot are also in correct and original condition whilst both large and small tools are kept within their respective compartments\n\nAll in all we feel this must be one of, if not, the best extant."}

Only 34 RHD cars were sold to the UK (and only 43 RHD cars globally). It is believed that the last 5 Maserati 3500GTi’s ever built are particularly unique.  Whilst they maintain the same external presentation of other 3500GTi’s, they are built on the Sebring chassis, have a single exhaust running through the middle of the car rather than through the left hand sill, dual fuel tanks in the rear wings instead of only a single tank and the battery mounted behind the rear seat and not under the boot floor. This car is the second to last 3500GTi that Maserati ever produced and is the last RHD car produced that remains in the UK today. The preceding number car was near-identical and owned by the late Bill McGrath of McGrath Maserati for many years. This car came with air conditioning from the factory and, somewhat romantically, the passenger head rest option. This was allegedly for the comfort of your female companion (and no headrest for the driver), how very Italian. This car had had a 9 year full nut and bolt restoration. Every part of the car has been meticulously rebuilt and returned to it's original former glory. Keeping the vehicle original was key to this restoration, including the original Lucas mechanical fuel injection system (often deleted on some restorations due to complexity) and therefore maintaining the authenticity of this beautiful, rare, motoring icon.

The car sits on BBS Alloys & is in impeccable condition thoughout.  A massive service history & maintenance record comes with the car showing it has been properly looked after.  The car has covered a scant 40,375 miles from new.\n\n\n\nAnnounced in April 1972, the AM V8 is an extensively modified version of the DBS VS which was announced in September 1969. Externally, the grill was entirely new, no longer sweeping across the complete front but now tailored between the head lamps reminiscent of the earlier six cylinder models such as the DB3S. The engine, was by then the well tried and tested all alloy V8 designed by Tadek Marek that had made it's first appearance in January 1967 at the Racing Car Show in London and raced by Lola in their Type 70 Mk III GT.\n\n1978 was an exciting year for Aston Martin and their owners, in June the Volante was unveiled and a few months later the V8 series IV or \"Oscar India\" = October Introduction, became available. The revised specification of the series IV included a change in shock absorber settings, leather head lining, burr walnut dash board and door cappings, discreet integral rear spoiler, carburettor bonnet bulge with the dummy air intake now closed at the front and extensive improvements to the standard air conditioning.\n\nThe final and most desirable version of the V8 Saloon, was first seen at the New York Motor Show on 26th January 1986. Benefiting from rolling production improvements enjoyed by its predecessor such as modified air conditioning and the adoption of 8\" BBS allow road wheels, the Oscar India series V now fed the 585 series V8 engine (revised in 1985 to included improved piston and cam profiles) by Weber-Marelli fuel injection delivering 305 B.H.P in a more refined and precise manner.\n\nAston Martin records show that this is a rare model with just 43 right hand drive and 17 left hand drive models built.\n\n\n\nVehicle History:\n\nFirst registered in 1989, the car was sold to its second owner just over a year later in March 1990. Then in May 1991, it moved to the stewardship of a Mr Irvine who acquired and maintained stewardship of the car through two employers, in whose name the car was registered before finally landing in his own name.   The current onwer purchased the car for his collection where it has resided in a heated garage alongside assorted Rolls Royce & Bentley motor cars.\n\n\n\nThe car is presented in outstanding order and a review of the history of the car reveals why - thorough service and maintenance through Works Service during the 1990's it had thorough attention to any mechanical or body requirements and under the previous owner, irrespective of its nominal mileage, the car has not only had a programme of regular maintenance but also a thorough mechanical, body, paint and underbody overhaul be the Aston Martin specialists, Aston Engineering.\n\nIn consequence, the car is presented in outstanding condition and is a pleasure to drive.\n\nSummary:\n\nThere are lovely cars brought to market  where their restoration has been a necessity brought about by historical neglect.\n\nThis car is very different - long term ownership by two Aston Martin enthusiasts has meant that the car has been consistently brought up to the highest standards. Under her current stewardship she has been taken to the next level - restored, enhanced and subject to maintenance and constant improvement.\n\nAn Aston Martin V8 Series V has always been recognised in the market for its rarity and its rightful position as the perfect evocation of the V8 - an everyday, useable classic.

A strictly limited production run of 99 cars, for worldwide production, were built at Aston Martin’s production facility in Gaydon, England with just 32 for the UK RHD market.\n\nThe Vanquish Zagato was based upon Aston Martin’s highly successful Vanquish model that utilised their VH chassis architecture, mated with a 6.0litre V12 engine, in this model tuned to produce 595bhp, capable of propelling the car to a 0-60mph time of 3.5sec. Bodied entirely in Carbon Fibre, the Vanquish Zagato incorporates many of the design houses signature styling cues such as the ‘double bubble’ roof and large front grille, built with the exquisite ‘Z’ pattern.

Purchased by Mr Lyons who specified Mineral Blue metallic paint and locking wheel nuts as highlighted on the new vehicle invoice, it was the first new car he ever purchased and he pampered it accordingly.  His pampering is best described as fanatical and the car was utterly cherished claiming in a printed advert when sold in 2016 that it had only been washed three times since 1990 and covered up in his garage with 30 bags of desiccant in it as a precaution, (a substance that absorbs water).  Despite minimal use it had more oil and filter changes that he could remember, was started and run every week or two and was only run on 4 Star petrol! MOT certificates and Ford invoices support all the maintenance work and low mileage.  A letter from Mr Lyons to the only other owner, Mr Harris, is also included for verification of the special history of this car.   All handbooks, service book, previous registration documents and spare keys are present and neatly filed along with all historic documentation.\n\nRepresenting a one-off example of the final edition Capri, this wonderful 2.0 Laser is ready for its next appreciative owner and would delight any Ford enthusiast and collector.\n\nMOT November 2024, HPI Clear."}

HPI clear.\n\nIt is MOT'd to November 2024 and our extensive preparation has included replacing brake pipes that were a previous mot advisory, fitting new front tyres, having an engine oil service carried out and also servicing the transmission. The rear tyres have also been changed at some point in the last 12 months. It performs and drives very well.\n\nThe first owner of this car was a London based lady who used it sparingly for the first couple of years of its life. The most recent owner (prior to ourselves) kept it for nearly 15 years before part exchanging it with a Mercedes dealer from where we sourced it.\n\nThe specification includes 5 speed auto transmission, cruise control, trip computer, heated front seats, air-con, climate control, electric glass sunroof, ESP/ABS, heated and electrically adjustable front seats, bi xenon headlights, auto lights & wipers. The colour combination of Ice Blue metallic with Alpaca leather is quite unusual and makes the car really stand out. It was originally supplied with 17\" alloy wheels but these were upgraded to the 18\" items seen here very early on in its life, we have just had them refurbished too as we felt they suited the car.\n\nThe V8 CLK's are quite a 'sleeper' at the moment. If BMW had built V8 versions of its E46 Coupe they would be highly sought after today. This is basically the Mercedes version of such a car being a big engine in a small compact body. The 5.0 V8 develops 306 bhp making this car capable of 0-60 in 5.9 seconds with a top speed limited to 155 mph, yet with excellent touring fuel consumption of 30 mpg being achievable. A few years ago I ran a W208 CLK 430 as a daily and found it was no more thirsty than a 2.0 Mondeo. \n\nOn the road the W209 500's have about 95% of the talent of the bigger CL500 but without all the added complexity of Active Body Control or vacuum operated everything. The CLK 500 is a much simpler car that rides on conventional suspension with much lower maintenance costs as a result.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to get in touch with your interest.\n\n"}

This matching numbers example was purchased in 2009 by the Director or Porsche Tech, London who had his team carry out a comprehensive rebuild and project that soon progressed to become a show piece for Porsche Tech and with the Supersport featuring wide steel rear wings, the decision was taken to rebuild the car as an accurate evocation of the RSR, incorporating a working front mounted oil cooler while keeping the engine totally stock for the drivability desired – it was to be a North London daily driver. 8000 miles have been covered since completion and the car is truly sensational.\nOn initial purchase the 911 stripped to a bare shell ahead of a complete nut and bolt rebuild. This way, the owner could ensure the shell was as good as new and the mechanicals would prove to be reliable. A photo record shows the bare shell being taken back to bare metal and all corroded metal being removed and replaced by renowned Porsche specialists, 911 Bodyshop in North London. A thorough record gives the detail of all metal work carried out ahead of preparation for a full re-paint in Grand Prix White. On completion of the body restoration, re-paint and RSR modifications, the car left the trusted Bodywork specialists to return to Porsche Tech for fitting up. The Porsche was then re-fitted with its now fully rebuilt engine, rebuild to standard 3.2L specification and rebuilt gearbox. All mechanical and electrical items showing signs of wear were replaced/re-conditioned and the car finished to an exceptionally high standard.\n\nSpecification wise the Porsche features a Wevo 915 gear shifter, Recaro bucket seats, 4 point harness, lightweight bonnet, ducktail, sports exhaust, air-conditioning, bonnet pins, front mounted oil cooler, deleted sunroof and rear seat, original Fuchs alloys, RSR roll cage, door cards, wing mirrors, rear bumper, front spoiler and RSR style fuelling system. Reportedly the car has lost 300 lbs in weight and on the road the car is beautifully setup and handles superbly with Bilstein Sports shock absorbers fitted to the front and rear. With its rebuilt engine and gearbox, the car is incredibly fit and having been checked over with a local 911 specialist we can confirm the car is excellent mechanically and impressive on the road. The bodyshell is quite simply outstanding, paintwork beautiful and its RS lightweight style interior very nicely presented. Within the past 2000 miles the Carrera has had a new set of tyres and maintenance to ensure its kept to a very high standard mechanically. This really is an impressive car and considering the costs to rebuild a genuine Supersport to this standard today, this car offers outstanding value."}
{"name": "1972 TRIUMPH GT6 - £22,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This amazing time warp has covered just 32000 miles from new and had just one recorded owner from new until we sold the car back in July 2023. The recent owner has struggled to get in and out of the car, and has only covered around 150 miles but considerable time, effort and money has gone into further improving this wonderful car. The GT6 comes with superb paperwork to include the original sales invoice and passport to service book. VJE 613L was supplied new by B.E Cocks & Co Ltd on Newmarket Road in Cambridge on the 29th September 1972 for a total price of £1614.27 to include overdrive, petrol, delivery charges, insurance, license and number plates. Interestingly, the original rear number plate (front had a sticker as per photo in the history file) is still with the car, both were changed for Black and Silver plates later. The passport to service book records the PDI service stamp from the supplying dealership at 46 miles, and the cars first service was carried out by Wheelers (Newbury) Ltd at 1115 miles in October 1972 when just a few weeks old. MOT certificates with the GT6 date back to 1979 at 9105 miles and a spare set of keys, tool roll and owner's manual accompany the car. Also with the car is the original speedo showing 29500 miles, the replacement speedo has clocked up 2500 miles since the change.\nThe one registered owner was based in the Caribbean on the Cayman Islands and this explains the ultra-low mileage. The GT6 was kept at a family member's address, registered there, and used whilst he was in the UK. Invoices and MOT history show the car in use during the 1980's and 1990's, but then the GT6 was dry stored and unused for many years. In 2022, the GT6 was re-commissioned, had a new clutch, brake master cylinder, various brake and fuel pipes, new front brake calipers and a comprehensive service. During the summer the GT6 had another major service, new front brake discs and pads and new tyres. The recent owner has also had all four road wheels blasted and painted in the correct Triumph Silver, the air cleaner box has been taken back to metal and painted, a Triumph battery retaining strap sourced and fitted, a new period aerial fitted, tailored quality mats fitted and front number plate mounting brackets made to original specification. The nice detailed work has beautifully finished the car off.\n\nThis is an incredibly original car; it has never required welding work and the interior appears totally original and lovely throughout. The bodywork is strong, solid and excellent, the only criticism of paintwork would be the expected imperfections commensurate with a 40-year-old very original car. The GT6 is bright, very well presented and is a true time warp. On the road the car performs superbly with a lovely fit low mileage engine, it handles and holds the superbly and offers a brilliant driving experience."}

When the Targa was first introduced at the Frankfurt motor show in 1965, it was named as neither a cabriolet nor a coupe. It was the best of both worlds. When the roof is closed, it still has the silhouette of the iconic coupe however if it is warm and sunny, you can always open the roof for a breath of fresh air. The Targa was created out of a necessity for Porsche to sell cabriolets in the United States. This was due to the US’s strict laws regarding the safety of cabriolets. As the original Targa had a roll bar, this was an easy way for Porsche to bypass concerns over the safety of a convertible in the potential occurrence of a rollover crash.\n\nOur 991.2 Carrera 4S Targa in the stunningly vibrant Sapphire Blue Metallic is the perfect blend between the busy city life and a sunset drive along the sea. The 17-second opening roof operation will leave an impression on everyone that gets to witness the spectacle. Our Targa has also been PPF (paint protection film) wrapped leaving the paint in an impeccable condition and also making the car cleaner for longer. If daily driving is your thing, then you will be glad to hear that our Targa comes with the very rare rear wheel axle steering option in order to improve stability at high speeds and manoeuvrability at low speeds in combination with the front lift system to make each speedbump a friend and not an enemy. With a Bose sound system, heated and ventilated seats 14-way sport seats, 2 year Porsche Warranty, sport exhaust system and a full Porsche service history, you will be hard-pressed to find another one as nicely optioned and as cared for as this one."}

The four-wheel drive cars remained distinctively wider and more purposeful, and the Targas benefited from having a more tractable suspension set-up. More traction and more fun -in any weather.\n\nThe Generation II vehicles received numerous positive reviews from the worldwide motoring press; even British motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson, a known detractor of Porsche cars, noted that the 997 will \"make love to your fingertips and stir your soul.\"\n\n\nThe 997 Targas are equipped with a 1.54 sq/m glass roof and hatch. At any speed, the roof can be opened in just 7 secs, to slide back underneath the hatch. When the glass roof is retracted, a small glass deflector is raised above the windshield to aid aerodynamic stability, whilst still retaining that wonderful wind-in-the-hair experience.

The fast, sleek, roadster received the big, twin-turbo V12 engine from AMG in 2004. From the outside, there were few clues to let others know that it was the top version of the SL. A front apron with a wide centre grille and angled spokes resembled the form of an F1 car. On the bumper's sides, a pair of air-exhausts were placed to help to cool the radiators. Behind the front wheels, another pair of air-scoops were installed to extract the air from the wheel-well.

In virtually every situation it was possible to keep the engine at its best torque range above 4,500 rpm. The 911’s horizontally opposed 6-cylinder engine is located at the rear, putting the weight of the engine on the driven wheels which aids greatly in increasing in increasing traction. The 993 has a hydraulic dual circuit braking system with 4-piston aluminium fixed calipers. All brakes are cross drilled, ensuring optimal braking even in wet conditions. The exceptional reliability and usability are down to Porsche’s constant use of Motorsport as a proving ground and development platform for the components of its road cars.\n\nFor the 993 to achieve maximum performance and a generous spread of torque, cylinder charging was further optimised by adding variable length inlet tracts to the two-stage tuned intake system. This was known as Varioram, and boosted torque at low and medium engine speeds, making torque more progressive, whilst at the same time ensuring maximum performance at peak revs. The engine produces 285 HP at 6,100 rpm, maximum torque is 340 Nm at 5,250 rpm. 0-62 mph takes just 5.3 seconds.\n\nOur 993 Carrera was supplied by Rivervale of Hove Porsche, West Sussex in August 1996, and has a comprehensive service history.

Pininfarina’s design broke somewhat with tradition and was both striking and innovative. The front wings flowed into one of the models most distinctive styling features, the deeply-straked door panels that grew in width towards their trailing edge, before blending into very wide rear wings. The side intakes were larger than on the previous model and this constraint saw the introduction of the long side strakes that would become the Testarossa’ s most recognisable feature. The Testarossa did not need a rear spoiler. The aerodynamic drag coefficient of Cd 0.36 was significantly lower than the Lamborghini Countach's 0.42. \n\nThe name Testa Rossa is Italian for Red Head and refers to the colour that the camshaft covers were painted on the sports racing models. Naturally the modern bearer of the name followed suit with red painted camshaft covers. It made its debut in the glittering surroundings of the Lido nightclub on the Champs Élysées in Paris, on the eve of the 1984 Paris Salon, where invited press and guests were given a gala preview prior to its public launch the following day. The evolution of the 12-cylinder boxer engine saw it equipped with four valves per cylinder: the most powerful engine mounted on a production sports car at the time of its launch.  \n\nThe Testarossa was a model that took its name from the company’s history, being derived from the successful 500 and 250 Testa Rossa series of sports racing cars from the late fifties. It had twin belt driven overhead camshafts per bank, now driven directly off the crankshaft instead of via idler gears on the earlier Boxer models. The dry sump engine was longitudinally mounted in unit with the five -speed transmission, in a very similar manner to that of the preceding Boxer series. It was fitted with a Marelli Microplex MED 120 B electronic ignition system and Bosch KE-Jetronic fuel injection, to produce the 390bhp @ 6300rpm for European models.   \n\nThe alloy wheels cover large, ventilated disc brakes with twin hydraulic circuits, and servo assistance. It also features all round independent suspension via wishbones, coil springs and hydraulic shock absorbers, with twin rear units plus front and rear anti roll bars. Weight distribution was 40% front, 60% rear. \n\nSupplied new by H,A Fox Ferrari, Torquay in April 1990, our Ferrari Testarossa has been carefully looked after by both of its previous owners.

It may have weighed circa 1800 kg but could see off the skimpy Ferrari 512BB and Testarossa plus the Lamborghini Countach with aplomb and carry an extra two passengers.\n\nThe heart of the Series 3 V8 Vantage is the V580 specification engine. Changes to the previous version included four 48mm Weber carburettors, Cosworth pistons, larger inlet ports and higher lift camshafts. Peak power is in the range of 420 bhp, and the torque figure was 395 lb.ft @ 5,100 rpm, making straight-line performance the best in its day. Acceleration from 0 -62 mph was achieved in just 5.2 seconds, and a top speed of almost 170 mph.\n\nOne of the most noticeable features was the closed-off hood bulge rather than the open scoop found on the normal V8. The grill area was also closed off, with twin driving lights inserted and a spoiler added to the boot lid. The 580 Vantage was a mechanical update which included the more powerful V8 from the limited-edition V8 Zagato. The V580 cars, as they are known at the factory, were the result of a process of standardising of engine parts across the AM V8 range, resulting in a quieter and smoother engine with both better economy and improved mid-range torque.\n\nThe V580 BBS cars are easily identified by wider wheel arches, increasing the overall width from 183 cm to 189 cm.  The rear spoiler became much neater and fully integral, and a smoother and closed bonnet bulge became standard across the range. Indeed, the only external differences between the standard model was the large front air dam, blanked off grille and badges.\n\nDelivered new by Aston Martin Kuwait in 1985, our car returned to the UK in 1989. During its long-term ownership, servicing works were carried out by RS Williams Ltd (Factory Heritage Service Centre) and further works were undertaken in 2016 by Pugsley & Lewis.  In 2018 Aston Engineering completed major works and upgrades to the Vantage costing more than £30,000. An Aston Martin certified factory record accompanies the history file and handbooks.\n\nWithout doubt this is an opportunity to acquire the highly desirable Vantage (V580) for much less than a similar X-pack car. The Vantage will be supplied with a 12-month comprehensive written warranty included.  \n\nAvailable to view now at our London showrooms."}

The car was strictly garaged and used sparingly in dry weather only, and the condition is absolute testament to this pampered existence.  The stunning factory Trophy Yellow, (Code FAR), paint finish is virtually perfect with no fading or imperfections worthy of mention and the original black woven acrylic fabric hood is immaculate.  All panels and shut lines are straight and even the boot lid is flush as opposed to often being raised due to the incorrect fitting of the tonneau cover.  All trim is unmarked and the Trophy 160 rear badge is proudly displayed as are the supplying MG dealer number plates and tax discs holder.\n\nINTERIOR\nThe sports seats with unique cloth centre panels, (Code WRA), are standard fitment on this limited edition MGF and in a condition that is commensurate with the incredibly low miles covered.  The vibrant exterior is mirrored inside the cabin with centre console and door casing inserts in body colour finish and the steering wheel leather inserts are incredible thanks to the only owner always wearing driving gloves.  The interior is simply outstanding and displays all the indicators of such a low mileage car with beautifully unworn touch points.  Both front and rear luggage areas are spotless with the front housing the original compressor in lew of spare wheel to allow for extra luggage space.  Even the black bezel head lamp units still wear the fragile Valeo part stickers as well as the genuine MG headlamp protectors!\n\nENGINE & TRANSMISSION\nThe desirable four-cylinder 1796cc VVC, (Variable Valve Control) engine produces 160bhp enabling a top speed of 137mph and 0-60 in just 6.9 seconds. The light weight body, race-bred chassis, mid-mounted engine and rear wheel drive configuration possesses all the correct sports car credentials to ensure optimum driver delight.  The uprated Hydragas suspension is set to the manufacturers ride height of 348mm, 20mm lower than standard.  The short throw sports ratio five speed gearbox completes the package.\n\nWHEELS, TYRES & BRAKES\nThe factory fitted 16inch Forged Spun Ultra alloy wheels are in superb order with no kerb damage and only very faint tarnishing to a couple of spokes, barely noticeable.  Ticking the box for absolute collector desirability are the factory fitted Goodyear Eagle F1 tyres which are not cracked or worn but should be replaced if regular use is intended.  Standard for the Trophy 160 are ventilated 304mm front discs gripped by AP Racing stop-sign red calipers and solid rear discs.\n\nHISTORY FILE\nSupplied new by Main Dealer, Marshall MG Rover in Peterborough, this UK MGF Trophy 160 SE was registered new on the 31st July 2002 to a Mr Kettle who purchased the car upon retirement. Preceding this MGF was firstly an Austin A30 purchased in 1960 followed by an Austin A40 in 1965 and a Skoda S100 in 1977.  Incredibly, Mr Kettle has kept the order forms and purchase invoices for these cars and they have been left in the history file for the MGF to tell a story of one mans driving career which has now come to an end.  Always a conscientious motorist, the owner has kept detailed journey logs dating back many years and inside the car were his driving gloves, brolly and various traditional road maps as well as Supaguard care products.  He even kept the original Autocar magazine from January 2001 when the car was launched and a Trophy Yellow example was the cover feature!\n\nIn November 2023 and major service including all oils and fluids was carried out along with the cambelt and VVC belt change as well as the water pump.  The original book pack is present along with both sets of keys with code tags, remote fobs and dealer keyrings and there is also an original sales brochure with price list.\n\nMOT August 2024, HPI Clear."}

This is a genuine German Arden factory model with full Arden bodykit, stainless steel quad exhaust and special Arden alloys costing £1500. I have seen only two other genuine Arden X Types for sale in the last twelve months - one made £8000 the other £9000. This is an extremely rare car. The car has full service history, stamped in the service book. Mechanically the car is in excellent condition, as a result of the comprehensive service history. There is a small oil leak from the sump which is common to these V6 (2.5 and 3.0) engines and will simply require cleaning and replacement of the sump sealant (not a gasket). The interior is in outstanding condition with no wear or damage whatsoever. The wheels were fully professionally refurbished approximately twelve months ago. The car drives superbly, as it should, with absolutely no known faults whatsoever. It sounds amazing and is fast, responsive and the handling is superb. I have had the sills completely rebuilt. This was carried out by a local renowned classic car restorers and involved complete removal of the inner and outer sills and part of the floor that was also corroded. The new inner and outer sills were then hand crafted, wax injected and coated in Dynatrol to add corrosion protection. This car is now 100% future-proofed. This was a professional rerestoration, not just a patch-up of the sills, and cost £1700.  Only sensible offers will be entertained. The car is sold as seen with no warranty implied or given.  Payment must be by bank transfer or cash and received on or before the date of collection of the vehicle."}

{"name": "1975 VOLKSWAGEN TYPE 2 WESTFALIA - £34,950 ", "transmission": " 4-SPEED MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Volkswagen introduced their ‘Type 2’ (the manufacturer’s second model) in 1950 and production ran in Germany until 1979, when the Type 3 model was introduced. Instantly recognizable to this day, they have achieved something of a cult status, given their widespread use during the ’60s and later, often associated with the surf culture from that decade. \n\nThe earliest models are referred to as ‘split screen’, referencing the windscreen style and the revised version – introduced in 1967 – the ‘bay-window’, similarly referencing a now altered windscreen design. In addition to this change, the second-generation vehicle was a little larger and heavier than the first variant; had revised suspension; 12-volt electrics and larger, more powerful engine options. In 1971, a revised 1.6 litre engine was introduced, rated at 50 bhp, driving through a 4-speed, manual transmission. In 1972, the flat-four engine was available in an enlarged 1.7 litre size, with a claimed 66 bhp on tap. Various cosmetic changes were also introduced in the early 1970’s, such as squared-off bumpers to meet US crash safety standards.\n\nIn the early ‘50s, Volkswagen commissioned a camper van conversion of the Type 2 and subcontracted the build of the vehicle to the company Westfalia-Werke. These ‘Westfalia’ conversions were made available worldwide through the VW dealer network and production continued until 2003 (based on the later T3 model).\n\nThis 1.6 litre Westfalia conversion was first registered, new, in Jersey in March 1975. It was the subject of a full restoration during 2012/13, carried out by ourselves on behalf of the then owner. Many thousands were spent on the restoration work, which covered bodywork, mechanicals and the interior. The vehicle was acquired by a Guernsey resident in 2020 and is now offered for sale again. \n\nThe mechanical works carried out in 2012/13 included a specialist engine rebuild, with the gearbox being checked; a full brake rebuild and suspension overhaul. With relatively limited subsequent use, and continued care and maintenance, the VW remains in a very good, usable condition. \n\nThe restoration work included the body and tilt roof, with the vehicle being re-finished in the correct colour of white over beige. Having been garaged in new ownership, the exterior is still in a first-rate condition.\n\nThe Westfalia conversion provides four berths - two doubles - with the second in the tilt roof space. The van is fully equipped with cooker, built-in fridge/cooler, sink, fitted tables and wardrobe. Restoration work was carried out using the correct Westfalia material, with the furniture being renovated to match the original finish. Further additions have been made – a storage unit between the front seats and television. All is in excellent condition.\n\nWhilst now an older restoration, this ‘Late Bay’ Westfalia is particularly smart, well-kept and remains in an excellent and very usable condition. It is ready to drive away and enjoy.\n\nThere is an accompanying history file and photographic record which details the restoration work carried out in 2012/13. \n\nThe car is currently Guernsey registered and we can assist with shipping and importation processes if required.

{"name": "1957 AUSTIN HEALEY 100/6 BN4 - £59,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 4886 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Austin-Healey 100/6 (BN4) went into production in August 1956 and was a replacement for the Austin-Healey 100/4 (BN1 & 2). It was followed by a BN6 variant in March 1958 which was a 2-seat roadster. The Austin-Healey 3000 (BN7) was introduced in 1959 and together the three models became known as the 'Big Healey's'. The 100/6 BN4 featured a 2'' longer wheelbase than the 100/4, a more powerful 2639cc straight-six engine and included a pair of small occasional seats in the rear. It had a smaller but wider radiator grille, an air scoop on the bonnet and the windscreen was now fixed. The cars used a tuned version of the BMC C-Series engine previously fitted to the Austin Westminster, initially producing 102 bhp (76 kW) and increased in 1957 to 117 bhp (87 kW) by fitting a revised manifold and cylinder head. The previously standard Overdrive unit was made optional. In December 1957 production was transferred from Longbridge to the MG plant in Abingdon and 14,436 100/6's were produced before production ended in 1959 when it was replaced with the Austin Healey 3000 MK1 (BN7). A 117 bhp (87 kW) BN6 was tested by The Motor magazine in 1959 and it recorded a top speed of 103.9 mph and could accelerate from 0-60 mph in 10.7 seconds. Overall fuel consumption of 20.8 miles per gallon was recorded. The test car cost £1,307 including taxes of £436. According to the BMIHT build certificate, this 'Matching Numbers' Austin Healey 100-SIX Four Seater - Chassis No: BN4-LO/45939 and Engine No: 1C/45939 was built in Longbridge, Birmingham for Export on 13th August 1957 and delivered to Dusseldorf in Germany. It was ordered by a US Army officer and was taken back to the USA when he returned home. Very little is known of it life in the USA, but it was purchased from the last American owner of 31 years in Indiana, USA in October 2013 and imported into the UK in 2014. The mileage on this car at the time of export was 34,000 and it is recorded on the Title Certificate as the actual mileage. Upon arrival in the UK it was treated to a complete body-off chassis nut and bolt rebuild and there is a fully documented history of restoration including a photograph album of the restoration from start to finish. Finished in its original colour scheme of Healey Ice Blue metallic over Old English White, the paintwork is exceptional, excellent panel gaps, new floors, including additional sound deadening to improve cabin comfort levels and the whole chassis was rust treated with stone chip protection before being painted in Ice Blue. The car has its original Matching numbers 2.6 litre 6-cylinder engine and 4 speed manual gearbox with overdrive on 3rd and 4th gear and the engine re-bored with new pistons and bearings, new valves and hardened valve seats to run with unleaded fuel with all new gaskets and the cylinder head was skimmed, new water pump, oil pump, timing chain, new Armstrong shock absorbers fitted all-round, new Drum brakes all-round with servo, new fuel tank, Electronic ignition, Electric cooling fan, Alternator conversion, New wiring loom, LED daytime running lights double as indicators, Rear indicator and headlight upgrades, Upgraded anti-roll bar, fully detailed and clean engine bay.  The car has had a brand new clutch fitted as well and the Overdrive unit works perfectly along with all the other cars’ functions. It’s had its first service since the rebuild of the engine and drives very nicely for a car of this vintage and sounds great too. There’s good oil pressure and the car maintains a good operating temperature aided by the fitted electric cooling fan. A great looking car from every angle, its timeless looks benefitting from the optional factory fitted 72 spoke wire wheels. The current indicated mileage of 4,886 is the number of miles recorded since the cars’ full rebuild in 2017 as the odometer was re-set at this time from the 34,000 recorded at the time of import. This is a fabulous example of a great British sports car, fully and sympathetically restored to a very high standard in recent years, since which time it has been garaged and continually fettled by its fastidious enthusiast owner. It would make a great addition to any car collection and it is also eligible for entry into the Mille Miglia. Upon sale, the car will come with a new MOT and our own standard 6 months Mechanical Breakdown Parts & Labour Warranty. It is of course Road Tax Free, MOT exempt and ULEZ compliant.

{"name": "1975 ROLLS-ROYCE CORNICHE CONVERTIBLE - £57,000 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 49000 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "1975 Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertible finished in Carnival Red with Beige hide interior. Originally ordered 21st May 1974 by Mr Cowan Esq, owner of Canair LTD. The car was ordered to Mr Cowan’s personal specification. Mr Cowan had previously ordered a Rolls-Royce Phantom VI had had something of a reputation at Rolls-Royce as a rather demanding customer, indeed the build records from RR details some of his more eccentric wishes, for example he has initially asked for this Corniche to be finished with wickerwork doors, something which Rolls-Royce eventually refused to do! The final specification was for special order Carnival Red paintwork, Beige Hide with matching headlining and roof, Light veneered Burr walnut woodwork throughout, Cartridge pocket for Quad tapes, net pockets to back of each front seats, Quadrophonic tape playing equipment (still with car) and hood to be trimmed in special order colour. After taking delivery of his Corniche on the 10th April 1975, Mr Cowan had the car maintained by Hoopers & Co until he sold it in 1977. The cars next chapter came when, in 1977 it was purchased by the 23-year-old John Hervey, 7th Marquess of Bristol. Having recently inherited the title and a 35-million-pound fortune. A notorious playboy, Lord Bristol, was to move to Monaco and what better car to take with him than this very striking Corniche. The car remained the with the Marquess in Monaco with the addition of a flag pole attachment to the radiator grille displaying his family crest.  Lord Bristol eventually sold the car to a friend in the USA until it returned to the UK in 2012. Offered for sale in excellent condition throughout, the body and paintwork are very smart indeed as is the interior retaining the original lambswool over rugs, full tool kit and hood tonneau cover. Overall, the condition is very original and commensurate with the warm climates this car has lived in and its rather distinguished history. On the road the car preforms very well in all respects with a quiet engine, smooth transmission and supple suspension. Sold fully serviced with a new MOT, this very eye-catching Corniche is now ready for its next chapter."}

{"name": "1971 FORD ESCORT RS1600 BDA MK.1 RHD 1971 - £57,200 ", "transmission": " MANUAL ", "mileage": " 60000 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "1971 Ford Escort Mk.1 RS1600 (Cosworth BDA) RHD\n\nThe Escort RS1600 was the first car to come from Ford UK’s new Advanced Vehicle Operations (AVO) division that was based in Aveley, Essex.   Launched in 1970 and fitted with a COSWORTH “BDA” DOHC 16V Head to the trusty Kent Cross Flow Block that produced a maximum of 122bhp from the 1601cc engine.\n\nThe RS1600 was capable of 0-60mph in 8.9 seconds on the way to a 115mph top speed.\n\nNOTABLY:   With a 10.0:1 compression ratio and two Dellorto 40 DHLA side-draught carburettors, peak output was 115bhp at 6500rpm and 110lb-ft at 4500rpm.   This rose to 122bhp at 6500rpm if the optional Weber 40 DCOE carburettors also homologated were installed.   For comparison, the outgoing Escort Twin Cam had pumped out 110bhp at 6000rpm and 107lb-ft at 4700rpm.\n\nAgain, like the Escort Twin Cam, the RS1600 transmitted its power through a four-speed manual Type 3 2000E Cortina gearbox with a hydraulic clutch and conventional differential. The same gear ratios and rear axle ratios were also carried over.\n\nAs with the original range topping model Escort Twin-Cam – which the RS1600 replaced – also has a Type 49 “Reinforced body” that was modified after body-in-white and trim production had been completed on the Type 48 (Escort 1300GT body) at the Halewood Plant, and then transferred to the Aveley based AVO Plant, but from November 1971 the special off-line production carried out the entire assembly operation.   Initially, these cars were White with Black interior trim – but later a range of standard and SVO body colours became available.\n\nThese ESCORTs are now fabulously collectible; just 1139 were made between 1970 and 1974 – which includes the CKD (Complete Knock Down) batch of 100 units that was sent to FORD South Africa Plant – meaning only 1039 of the cars were sold and registered in the UK.   There is no record of the FORD Australia or New Zealand Plants ever assembling the Escort RS1600 Mk 1., although they did produce the “lesser” models in the range.\nAccording to the DVLA records for 2023 Q2, only 70 of these cars are still on the UK roads, with a further 70 examples which are SORN.   Which also means that compared to the 2022 figure for the same period, only one SORN car has been returned to the road in the last year.   It seems that some fifty years later, even the relatively inexpensive when new “Rally Sport 1600”, has become expensive to properly restore to original ex-factory condition.\nThe example offered here is an original part of this relatively low-volume AVO Production.\nApart from already being considered as extremely rare by any standard, this car also has a further interesting FORD history as well.\n\nAccording to FORD OF SOUTH AFRICA record archives, they were shipped 100 (One hundred) of these cars in CKD format directly from the AVO Plant in Essex UK for South African plant production.\n\nObviously, being an RS1600 “Type 49 Bodyshell” it came complete with all the body modifications that AVO carried out.   Of these cars, FORD SA decided to only assemble 60 (Sixty) units, the reason being that rural Dealerships simply did not have suitably qualified mechanics, to handle a BDA along with the early versions of the engine suffered from oil feed problems, that was later cured by FORD, and seemingly some other unstated reasons.\n\nThe remaining 40 (Forty) units were built in collaboration with BASIL GREEN MOTORS of PERANA CARS fame.  By that time, BG had already built a strong reputation with the FORD SA and their Buyers, for their “tuned” V6 3000 engined CORTINA’s and of course the CAPRI Mk.1 PERANA V8.    Basil’s brief from FORD was to transplant his tuned version of the PINTO (USA) COLOGNE (Germany) 2000 SOHC engine – which was subsequently also used by Ford of Europe in their Escort Mk.2 RS2000, etc.!   So, Basil’s work on the forty renamed “ESCORT PERANA” cars were in some respect the fore runner to FORD using the simpler layout of the PINTO engine for several years afterwards.\n\nThis car is a matching numbers unit confirmed by three production tag system that FORD SA implemented to avoid “clones” being represented as genuine and original cars - along with other detail from FORD of South Africa.   The following are substantiated and verified for this car;\na)\tThe FoMoCo VIN tag corresponds to all records.\nb)\tThe Cosworth BDA Engine Number matches with the VIN as being the original ex-factory motor.\nc)\tThe FORD Factory Archive Record matches.\nd)\tThe FORD Factory SVO PRODUCTION tag in-situ matches, as does the FoMoCo VIN tag, and SHOCK-TOWER stamping, and the ENGINE NUMBER stamping.\ne)\tAll of the above detail is also replicated and thereby verifies this car as a matching numbers car in every conceivable manner.\nf)\tThe History of Ownership - three to date - is known and corroborated.\ng)\tThe RESTORER and ENGINE REBUILDER are known to me, and well qualified for the job.   And, yes the Racing and Rallying fraternity in SA have long used COSWORTH BD-SERIES engines, particularly in Classic and Historic races / rallies is commonplace, and the prerequisite support in engineering and mechanical expertise required for this RS1600 is available today still – as it is in the UK.\nh)\tThe standard item in the car is the front seats - which are the same era and identical trim standard Capri v4 2000 items - it's possible that UK market production varies from this.   However, its likely that a new owner will install their choice of Bucket seats and Harness required - irrespective of the car's future use as a road-only car or a rally car.\ni)\tThe STEERING WHEEL is left in-situ, and although needing replacement I’m not upgrading as this is a low-cost choice of preference by the new owner.\n\nThis car is original, albeit was last year resprayed in her correct original BRIGHT YELLOW that was also used on the BG Capri Perana V8 derived SVO production cars.   The second owner was the culprit in changing her to PERI-PERI RED (which were the only two colour choices on the Capri PERANA’s).\nThis aside, the car has been meticulously restored to original road-car standards.   The car was supposed to be completed, along with her fully rebuilt BDA-engine and drivetrain, and ready for her new home globally in late February 2023 – but ESKOM power outages and another COVID scare delayed things.   The upside of this is that the third and present owner – whom I represent as his chosen Broker – also owns his own classic car restoration business, is active in the motorsport scene as a driver entrant and is pedantic about the right way of doing a car restoration without come-backs.\nKeen observes will note from the images that the car has not been for her final VALET and DETAILING which particularly applies to the interior.   However, I prefer to have my people in Cape Town do the final preparation just before sea-container packing to ensure the buyer’s compliance with their country of residence is met.\n\nPURCHASE PRICE of this Escort RS1600 is (GBP) £57,200 includes the Brokerage & Buyers Agent Fees and the following services and their related charges are also included within the stated PURCHASE PRICE.\n\tDelivery to Port of Exit.\n\tDEKRA Road Worthy Certificate.\n\tOptional - DEKRA Technical Report.\n\tSA Police and SA Customs Export Certificates.\n\tDEKRA DataDOT Invisible Marking & Certificate.\n\tValet & Detailing charges as required by offshore Customs and other Authorities.\n\tSA Export and UK Import Clearing Agent charges.\n\tContainer Shipping and LLOYDS Maritime Insurance.\n\tDeparture & Arrival Port charges.\n\tHMRC Import taxes paid complete with NOVA.\n\tCollection of Sea Container from Port and delivery to Clearing Agent Warehouse.\n\tUnpacking of your car and immediate dry storage in the warehouse awaiting your collection by using a car-carrier transporter.\nIn summary the above-mentioned overall Purchase Price also includes the itemised costs detailed directly above which amount to a combined total of (GBP) £7,800 that is paid for on your behalf as part of our seamless service.   Some of these costs can be retained and paid directly by the Buyer as and when required – just ask!\n\nShould you require, we are also able to conduct the entire DVLA registration procedure for an additional charge of (GBP) £1,400 which includes the following.\n\tUK MoT Test & Certificate\n\tOr the IVA Test & Certificate (if required)\n\tDVLA Period Registration.\n\tBlack period Number Plates.\n\tRoad Tax (unless exempt)\n\tIf we handle the DVLA Register process, then there is no storage charge.\nOnce the entire arrival procedure has been handled on your behalf you may “legally” drive the car home from our Arrival Agent Warehouse – just remember to Insure the car properly beforehand.\nShould you require, we are also able to make a Car Carrier Delivery to your Home or Office Address by car-carrier service – this can be done on arrival if you already have garaging or off-road parking facility, or if you don’t wish to collect the car personally after we have attended to the DVLA process.   This is based upon distance from our Clearing Warehouse and charged at a reasonable cost per mile by road.   Please just ask for a quote.\n\nThere are no hidden costs whatsoever.

Start by giving me a call on WhatsApp, during which all questions will be answered.\nThe real question is whether you can buy an identical fully restored, accident free, rust free, matching numbers, non-clone RS1600 for less?

{"name": "1980 ASTON MARTIN VANTAGE SERIES 2 OSCAR INDIA - £147,000 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 55488 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This superb Aston Martin is not only highly desirable, but also extremely rare being 1 of only 44 genuine Series 2 (second generation) V8 Vantage Oscar India Coupes built between October 1978 and March 1980.   Notably, an example of these was featured in the 1987 film; “The Living Daylights”, and again in the last Daniel Craig era film; “No Time to Die”.  \nThis dark Silver Metallic piece of iconic automotive art will give you goosebumps the moment you turn the ignition key and hear the LAGONDA QUAD CAM V8.  There are very few cars that can leave someone speechless, but this one will do the job!\nThe ASTON MARTIN V8 VANTAGE Series II V8 “Oscar India” was hailed at its introduction as “Britain’s First Supercar” for its 170 MPH (270 KPH) top speed.   Its engine was shared with the LAGONDA Saloon, specifically the V8 Quad Cam producing 280 kW, albeit modified as it used high performance camshafts, increased compression ratio, larger inlet valves, and bigger 4 Weber carburettors mounted on new manifolds for increased output.   Straight-line performance was the best of the day, with acceleration from 0-60 mph (97 kph) in 5.3 seconds, one-tenth of a second quicker than the FERRARI DAYTONA.\nThis vehicle might be part of the actual 1979 production, albeit the Car Completed Final Inspection” factory report signed on 31st January 1980, includes details. \nChassis No.:  V8SOR 12228.\nEngine No.:   V/540/2228/S.\nNote:  During the course of 1980 production, there was a “Series” production change, whereupon the engine was changed from the V/540 (as fitted here), to the V/580 version.   ASTON MARTIN did this to create conformity in their production line of common engine parts between the LAGONDA and VANTAGE which used the same Quad Cam engine.  The V/580 engine was the lesser outright performance machine, the payback being slightly better fuel consumption.\nGearbox No.: 6551/1332.\nRear Axle No.: J79/209\nOther detail notation included a “KPH” Speedometer (for South Africa), a Large Middle East Fan and Thermostat, and a Pioneer 9300 Radio/Tape player, and three key numbers. The car now fitted with a new period appearance BEKKER sound system.\n\nThis car was subsequently shipped directly from the Plant in Newport Pagnell on the 2nd of June 1980 to the Authorised Distributor; Grosvenor Motors, of Parktown North, Johannesburg, South Africa – arriving sometime in July 1980, then inspected and prepared for the first owner - a lady buyer, who resided in the Sandton (Illovo) area of Johannesburg. She took delivery on 18th August 1980, so the car was first-time registered then. Later acquired by the second, and still the present owner - also of Johannesburg. This has lived from new in the high altitude, dry snow-free climate, and ozone-free environment of Johannesburg in Guateng Province.\nIn recent times the car underwent a ground-up restoration, by the acknowledged Aston Martin specialist in Johannesburg - on an open chequebook basis. The project began in July 2016, and only took about 7-months, the final summary of account is dated 6th February 2017.  The job card entailed bare shell respray – glass out and fully stripped vehicle - it was still a rust-free aluminium bodyshell. The interior received a restored burr walnut dashboard, new black leather upholstery throughout, and new black wool carpeting, switch gear and instrumentation were all refurbished. The outer body received re-chromed fittings, new locks, new mirrors, new wheel centre caps, restored road wheels, new tyres, re-polished wheel studs. The engine was stripped and rebuilt with new components as required, as was everything else under-bonnet.  The under-carriage included new exhaust, powder coated manifolds, new dampers, brake discs and pads, new bushes, and every part not replaced was properly media-blasted and stove-enamelled as required – in many respects this car is again in nearly as new condition overall. \nThe total spend according to the bill was the equivalent of over £44,000, using the prevailing exchange rate then - including all parts ordered from the UK. Notably, the Labour Charges in the UK back then was a minimum 30% higher than the high-end specialist SA-Workshop/s that completed this superb restoration – if this restoration had been in the UK, it would have conservatively cost £53,500 then.   I know this from having priced a similar restoration in 2017.\nI have over 30 years of experience in sales and project managing the restoration of Classic Cars on behalf of my clients. Your offshore buy of this or any other car that I offer is backed by seamless and fast shipping coordination to any global port of arrival you required – I have successfully shipped “unseen” cars to eighteen (18) countries to date.\n\nIn this instance the PURCHASE PRICE of this rare Supercar quoted as fully inclusive of all arrival expenditure for the UK. These inclusions amount to £13,000-odd of combined charges for Export DataDOT, Dekra Technical Report, SAPS/Interpol & Customs Certificates, Delivery to Port & Export Clearing Agent charges, SINGLE-CAR 20” SEA CONTAINER SHIPPING – Cape Town to London Gateway, Lloyds In-Transit All Risk and Total Loss Insurance, HMRC Import VAT, UK Port Arrival charge, UK Clearing Agent fees and charge for Container Collection to Warehouse delivery ready for your collection by transporter – complete with NOVA.   The post-landed costs can be paid as a second tranche if required but not later than the ship ETA date in UK Port.   \n\nOPTIONAL EXTRA CHARGE: MoT (even if exempt), IVA Certificate (if applicable), DVLA Registration and period correct Black Plates fitted.  No warehouse storage charge if providing this service.\n\nOPTIONAL EXTRA CHARGE: Transporter delivery to your nominated UK address – before or after DVLA required process.\n\nFor cost variances to other destinations please just ask.\n\nI would appreciate your initial enquiry by email with your name and best contact number, however, should you wish to not disclose such detail, and want to discuss the car directly with me, then please be aware that I travel often, and it’s easier and less costly to connect on WhatsApp.   Also, my home base in Hampshire has a cell-carrier signal that is non-existent – awaiting a VOIP connection – please meanwhile call using WhatsApp or leave a message.\n\nLife is not a rehearsal!

Was rescued from a factory having been bricked in for 12 years and has been recommissioned; has had an engine service; and new brake pads all round. \n\nThe care needs using and includes and interesting number plate. Driving this car takes you straight back to the eighties. All you need is a sheep skin coat a trilby hat cigar and a friend called Terry Mccan - Ready to drive away.\n"}

I've owned it for about 19 years. This is a reluctant sale due to ill health. It has the original chassis and bulkhead, never welded or repaired. Every time I serviced it I have sprayed the chassis and running gear with waste oil and paraffin. There aren't many Series Land Rovers with chassis and bulkheads this good. Please see photographs. It has been stood on SORN for 13 years. The brakes are seized on and the clutch doesnt work. I'm not able to repair this so it will be sold-as-seen. The seats are non standard, the front cover panel and sill panels are missing. It has the 2.5 litre petrol engine, not the 2.25 litre. The paint work is showing signs of age. It will not take much work to get this back on the road again. Please telephone Roger after 6pm for more details. "}

The car has been laid up in the previous owners garage for several years before my ownership of 3 years. Original colour of Arden Green with Silver Birch roof, Webasto sunroof and Brown interior. Engine turns over but not currently running (was running roughly several years before my ownership of 3 years). Estimated mileage from receipts of 175,000 so may need an overhaul, gearbox and differential condition unknown. All mechanicals will need a full overhaul. Body/chassis appears solid structurally but will need some welding repairs, e.g. rear bumper hanger, repairs to door bottoms, some minor areas underneath (see pictures - not exhaustive - there is also a lot of non-structural surface rust). The car will require respraying. New Radial tyres fitted recently as old tyres were not holding air. Some interior repairs/re-trimming/leather feeding required but seats are firm. Some spares also included, including spare wheel tray. Extensive history file over many years. Very regrettable sale but I no longer time to restore in the near future. Information given is based on my own assessment and cannot be guaranteed, therefore inspection is strongly recommended to fully assess condition. The car will require towing out of my garage and driveway and uplifting (a low loader with a multi directional electric winch is advised as my driveway slopes down from the street and the street is narrow).

Although the body shape was very similar to the original Healey, the car was an extremely capable modern sports car in its own right and was widely regarded as the finest in its class, so much so that Geoffrey Healey endorsed it himself and the new car would have been launched with the blessing of the Healey family had it not been for a trademark dispute with Jensen in 1989 preventing them from using the Healey name. Despite this draw back, the 'HMC MKIV' as it was named, had excellent reviews from magazines such as Motor Sport and Performance Car and it was featured on Top Gear in March 1996 by Quentin Wilson who said ‘No Austin-Healey was ever this well built’ and specialist sports car manufacturers like Lotus and TVR should take a long, hard look at the HMC to see how it really should be done.’ The motoring press agreed that this car was far more than an homage to the Austin Healey 3000 and only 167 MKIV cars were built by the Holmes brothers before production ceased in 1999 due to parts supply issues. This 1999 HMC MK1V LIGHTWEIGHT is a ONE owner car and has covered just 49,600 miles from new! Built in early 1999 this beautiful HMC MK1V 'Lightweight'  - Chassis No: SA904943GXURT0135 (the 135th built) and Engine No: 47A09526B was supplied new by the UK sole concessionaires 'All Electric Garages' in Birmingham and it was first registered on 19th March 1999 and delivered to its first and only owner in Northolt, Middlesex. It is finished in Ink Blue Metallic with Parchment Leather trim with Blue carpets and over-mats, a Blue Mohair Soft Top, a lightweight moulded dashboard with Smiths instruments and has the customary all-aluminium Rover 3947cc 190bhp V8 Engine coupled to a Five Speed Gearbox and driving through an aluminium Differential, Independent front and rear Suspension, factory fitted Immobiliser and Gear Lock System, Power Assisted Brakes, Stainless Steel Exhaust System and 15'' Chrome Wire Wheels. This example is in beautiful condition throughout and is a very rare car being just one of only 167 MK1V's being built in total. Maintained meticulously to an excellent standard by specialists including Holmes Motor Company. It comes with all its original books and paperwork including Sales Invoice, lots of invoices, MOT Certificates and HMC literature.  HMC's really do need to be seen in the flesh and driven to fully appreciate just how good they are to drive and own and with prices steadily increasing, they do represent a sound investment! Upon sale the car will come with a new MOT & our own customer care package including a 55-point pre-delivery inspection and 6 months mechanical breakdown Parts & Labour Warranty which can be upgraded and extended at additional cost if required.

The history file on this car is simply outstanding with 2 Ring binders full of invoices (hundreds), all MOT certificates from its first one in 1979 to date, vehicle logs for both petrol put in and all works carried out, ownership history and owners correspondence relating to works on the car from new! It had a reconditioned exchange 'unleaded' engine fitted by Southern Triumph in May 2000 with the mileage at 54,000 and a year later in 2001 it had the highly desirable Tate & Lewis Triumph Stag ZF 4 speed gearbox fitted which has lock up torque convertor and with a top gear ratio similar to that of the 4 speed manual gearbox, so this lowers the engine revs at higher speeds - only 2,700rpm @ 70mph - and this naturally improves fuel consumption and together with almost seamless gear changes, it makes for more comfortable driving throughout the range. In addition, it has the Monarch (Jonathan Finnis) Holley carburettor conversion kit fitted in place of its original Stromberg carburettors which makes a huge difference to the performance of the car and a Hart Racing Supergill Radiator, Kenlowe electric fan (very seldom needed now), Polyurethane suspension bushes and Koni adjustable shock absorbers. The car has been exceptionally maintained by its previous owners and it had a new 'unleaded' engine in 2000 and the bodywork was restored in circa 2004 and all works are fully documented and included on the vehicle log with over £18,000 being spent between 2000 and 2008. In 2009 it was purchased by the owner of Quick Fit Safety Belts and sold to the current owner in 2013. During his ownership it has been regularly maintained by Triumph specialist Enginuity in London and there are invoices from them for over £10,500 for various works and new parts and by Peter Ostling Automotive in Sutton in 2023 for a further £1,500 for new Robsport Disc Brakes and pads + brake hoses, Automatic Transmission oil and filter service and a strip and rebuild of the Holley carburettor.

{"name": "1982 AUSTIN MINI MOKE - £23,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 14478 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Mini Moke is a small, front-wheel-drive utility and recreational convertible, designed by Sir Alec Issigonis and John Sheppard and conceived and manufactured as a lightweight military vehicle by British Motor Corporation (BMC) and subsequently marketed for civilian use under the Austin, Morris, Leyland, and Moke brands. When launched in 1964 the original price was only £405 and it came with a style money couldn’t buy. BMC's Cowley plant started building Moke's in January 1964 and 14,518 were produced in the UK between 1964 and 1968, but only about 1,500 were sold to UK buyers. The Mini Moke and British weather didn’t make the ideal pair. It found greater success across the globe, from the US to the Seychelles and all the way to Australia. It first gained international recognition when the Beach Boys – at the height of their fame – posed with one during their 1966 international tour and it made its small screen debut in the hit British television series The Prisoner a year later. It got a further bump when it appeared in multiple James Bond films including You Only Live Twice (1967), Live And Let Die (1973), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and Moonraker (1979). Interestingly, it was only a Bond car once, in Live and Let Die, when Roger Moore drove a stylish version of the car on the fictitious island of San Monique. In the other movies, it was the car used by the baddies. The San Monique Moke helped popularise the Moke across places like Hawaii and the Caribbean. It would receive another flash of the spotlight years later as well, when the legendary Brigitte Bardot drove her dogs in her own car through the streets of St Tropez in France. Due to the huge demand for the cars after the Beach Boy's were seen in one, BMC set up a manufacturing plant in Sydney in 1966 to build the car. Around 26,000 Mokes were built in Australia from 1966 until the last one came off the line in late 1981. As the production in Australia was winding down, British Leyland (Mini’s owner at the time) moved manufacturing to a subsidiary in Portugal, where about 10,000 Mokes would be produced between 1980 and 1993. In April 1990, British Leyland (by then called Rover Group) sold the ''Moke'' name to Cagiva, a motorcycle manufacturer in Bologna, Italy. Production continued in Portugal under Cagiva's auspices until 1993, when Cagiva transferred the tooling to their own factory in Varese, Italy with the intention of restarting production there in 1995 — which they never did, although some unfinished cars were assembled in Italy. Cagiva was made to pay a considerably higher price for the Rover-made parts than had BL's Portuguese subsidiary, and the enterprise never made financial sense. Since Cagiva did not own the ''Mini'' name, the 2071 cars they built were sold simply as ''Moke's'' and these brought the total production run of Mini Mokes and Moke derivatives to 49,937 during its near 30 year life. https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home/heritage/the-mini-moke.html This fabulous Austin Mini Moke - VIN No: 103101 was one of the last cars built by Leyland Australia and was shipped directly to Cox & Buckles Spares Ltd (now Moss Europe Ltd) in Richmond, Surrey who were then concessionaires for the Australian Mini Mokes in the UK and it was first registered in their name on 20th December 1982. They sold the car to its first owner - the owner of Epping Motor Company in Ongar, Essex on 1st January 1983 and he took the car straight to his house in Cap Antibes in the South of France where it was kept for most of his 35 years of ownership before bringing it back to the UK in 2017. The decision was made to sell the car here in the UK and it was subsequently sold to the previous owner in May 2018 for £26,000 with the mileage recorded on the speedometer of 23,240 Kilometer's (ordered from Leyland Australia with a Kilometer Speedo) and there is a letter/contract in the history file confirming this. The car was finished in White with Black trim and had the standard steel Mini wheels fitted when it was built, but the new owner decided to have it repainted for his wife and the car was totally stripped with everything taken off the car - not that there is much, and it was repainted in Light Green - keeping the roll bars in their original White and the interior was re-trimmed in off-white with black piping. The original wheels were replaced with a new set of 13'' Mini Lite Alloy wheels and fitted with new Yokohama 185/60/13 Tyres. In addition, a new wooden Mota-Lita Steering wheel was fitted + a Sony Stereo/CD Player. Upon completion in late 2018, the car was sent straight to his Villa in Val de Lobo, Portugal, but it was hardly driven at all during the 5 years it was in Portugal and covered no more than 50 Kilometers in total. As a result of this, he sold it in July 2023 to his English neighbour in Portugal who has just brought it back to the UK and given it to us to sell for him. This car is in ''As New'' condition throughout and has only covered a genuine and documented 23,300 Kilometers from new and drives beautifully. Upon sale the car will receive a pre-sales service and new MOT and it will come with our own 6 Month Mechanical Warranty which can be upgraded and extended at additional cost if required. This car is now over 40 years old and upon sale to the new owner, the taxation class on the V5 Log Book will be changed to 'Historic Vehicle' making it Road Tax exempt, MOT exempt and also ULEZ exempt.

{"name": "1984 PORSCHE 911 CARRERA 3.2 TARGA - £69,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 147890 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Porsche 911 Carrera 3.2 was produced for model years 1984 to 1989. If you are looking to get into classic Porsche 911's, then the 3.2-litre Carrera line up is a good place to start. Reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1977, it featured a new higher-displacement power plant, the 3164cc six-cylinder boxer engine producing 231 bhp and this engine addressed the calls for more performance and became the most commercially successful 911 yet. Over 70,000 units were produced, and they are still plentiful, affordable, and blend the tradition of the early cars with dabs of modernity and comfort. 3.2 Carrera's were offered in all three 911 body styles: Coupe, Convertible, and the Targa, with its removable centre roof panel. This beautiful Porsche 911 Carrera 3.2 Targa - Chassis No: WP0ZZZ91ZES140992 and Engine No: 63E04619 is a fully matching numbers car and was supplied new by Charles Follett Limited in Berkeley Street, London W1 to its first owner in London and registered on 17th April 1984. It is finished in its original colour scheme of Grand Prix White with a Black Leather interior piped in White, Black carpets, Black vinyl removable Targa roof panel, 3164cc flat six engine, 5 Speed Manual Gearbox and sitting on a set of 16'' Fuchs Alloy Wheels. The car has a full service history from new with all invoices from 1985 to date and has been exceptionally well maintained during its life by Porsche main dealers Charles Follett, Porsche Centre Reading, Porsche Centre in St Johns Wood, Porsche specialist's Pickup Leask in Hampstead, RUF Automobile in Tunbridge Wells, Autowerke in Norwich and latterly Carrera Performance in Horsham who carried out the restoration and mechanical rebuild in May 2018 at a cost of £22,192.88. We sold this car to the current owners in July 2019 and prior to his purchase he had the car inspected by Porsche Inspections and their full report is shown in the documents attached, but this was their summary: ''This car, a 911 Carrera 3.2 is a 1984-model year, as denoted by the ‘E’ as the tenth digit of the VIN and third digit of engine and gearbox numbers. 3.2 (3164cc) Litre engine (231bhp) with the five speed (915) manual gearbox, Targa body with black interior. The engine and gearbox numbers are correct for the 1984 model year so this is a matching numbers example. The Guarantee & Maintenance booklet is the original and shows the supplying dealer as Charles Follett of London. The book is full and there are records up to 1997, but there are lots of invoices dating from 1985 right the way through to the present day. There is also every MOT certificate from 1988 to date. Then there is a gap in the history, up to 2018 when a very thorough body and full mechanical rebuild was carried out (one of the bills for this work comes to over £22k). As the car is in a 12 month / 12k schedule, the next service is now due, it is not clear when the brake fluid was last replaced and the MOT has expired. The speedometer was replaced in October 1989 by Porsche specialist Pick-Up Leask @ 77,401 miles so the total mileage is around 143k miles. A close visual inspection of the bodywork shows that the car has undergone a very comprehensive and high quality restoration. Some panels have been replaced but the structure appears remarkably original. The repairs that have been carried out (kidney bowl areas) have been done incredibly well. The shell is free of corrosion and very clean underneath – almost to concours standard. The paintwork is almost perfect with an even finish and no ‘orange peel’. A paint thickness test did not reveal any evidence of filler, apart from the small areas usually found even on unrestored cars (bases of the rear wings). Both sills are solid, as are the suspension mounting points. Structurally, this must be one of the best examples in the country and is a testament to the restorer. The interior is well preserved and is clean and tidy throughout. The floor is dry and there are no signs of dampness (unusual for a Targa). The seats and door panels show a level of wear in line with the age and mileage. Some of the carpets are torn and one of the rear seatbelts is missing. A few electrical items are not working - the headlamp washers, a few bulbs and the electric mirrors – the mirrors are later items and may not be compatible. The battery failed a test and needs to be replaced. The engine has clearly had a thorough rebuilt, it is free of leaks (unusual to see such a dry engine) and many brackets and bolts have been replaced. The exhaust is in excellent shape. There were no leaks from the gearbox either and the oil cooler lines are all good. The car performed well on test drive with no rattles or knocks from suspension or interior. Although congestion limited the speeds, the engine pulled well and showed good oil pressure, there was no smoking from the exhaust. The gearbox was ok, the 915 has a reputation for being a little difficult and this one was no different, with a slightly vague action. The Targa roof proved to be leaking above both doors (particularly the drivers side). In summary – the bodywork on this car is fantastic and would be welcome at many concours events. Overall, highly recommended.'' Since we sold the car back in July 2019 most items highlighted in the report have attended to and it has now covered a further 4,029 miles and a total of 147,890 documented miles from new. This car is still in exactly the same condition as it was when inspected back in July 2019 and no oil leaks or any faults whatsover. The only improvements in our opinion would be recovering the original leather seats which show some wear, but thats really it! This must genuinely be one of the nicest examples currently available for sale and it will also be eligible for Historic Vehicle status from April 2024 and therefore Road Tax free, MOT and ULEZ charge exempt. Before sale, the car will be given a full check-over and a new MOT and pre-sales service and it will come with our own 6 Month Mechanical Warranty which can be upgraded and extended at additional cost if required.

{"name": "1977 PORSCHE 911 S 2.7 - £64,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 68134 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "According to the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity this Porsche 911S 2.7 Coupe - Chassis No: 9117201522 and Engine No: 6272685 is a 'matching numbers' car and was manufactured in Germany in December 1976. It was originally finished in Bitter Chocolate with a Cork Leatherette interior and with the following options: Fuchs forged Alloy Wheels with Pirelli Tyres, Koni Shock Absorbers instead of Boge, Oil Cooler, Leather Steering Wheel and an Electric Sun Roof and it was first registered on 1st March 1977 in Wisconsin, USA. The car was repainted in Guards Red at some stage in its life in the USA, but unfortunately there is no prior history from the USA, which is not unusual, so we do not know when the colour was changed, but it still has its original and very nice Cork (Beige) leatherette interior, Porsche over-mats, 2687cc Flat Six Engine, 5 Speed Manual Gearbox, Sony Stereo/Radio/CD player, Electric Sun-Roof, original Porsche Tools and sitting on its original 15'' Fuch's Alloy Wheels with relatively new Vredstein tyres. It was purchased by the previous English owners in February 2017 when they lived in New York and it only had 3 owners in the USA prior to them. The car had a considerable amount of work carried out on it soon after buying the car and there are bills totalling over $17,000 in the history file from Porsche specialist Intersport Performance in Virginia. When they came back to the UK in August 2018 they shipped the car back with them as they loved it so much and couldn't bear to sell it! It was first registered in the UK on 1st October 2018 and issued with the age related numberplate TRJ 828R. Since arriving here, a further £4,000 was spent by them with Precision Porsche in Uckfield, West Sussex on various works and copies of all invoices are contained in the Documents shown on this advert. They reluctantly decided to sell the car last year and we sold the car for them in May 2022 to a car collector when it had covered a believed genuine 67,105 miles from new, but due to a change in his personal circumstances, the car is now being offered for resale. It has spent most of the last 12 months in storage with only 1,000 miles being driven during this time and due to the paint having faded over the years, the decision was made to completely strip and repaint the car before offering it for resale and it was given to renowned paint specialists GP Auto Design in London in early September 2023. They have just completed a full 'glass-out' repaint of the car to an exceptional standard with works also including the fitting of all new rubber seals, new sunroof seals and parts, new front and rear screen rubbers, new bumper rubbers and new badges and the bodywork is now faultless! The cost of these works including parts came to just under £10,000. It has now covered a believed genuine 68,134 miles from new and being of 'Historic Vehicle' status, the car is ULEZ exempt, MOT exempt and Road Tax free. This is a beautiful car and lovely to drive and it should be a good investment as well as that can be driven and enjoyed, Upon sale the car will receive a pre-sales service and new MOT and it will come with our own 6 Month Mechanical Warranty which can be upgraded and extended at additional cost if required.

{"name": "1965 MG MGB MK1 'PULL DOOR HANDLE' ROADSTER - £16,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 8001 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The MGB was first introduced in 1962 at the Earls Court Motor Show and it was to become Britain's best selling medium sized sports car of all time. Brought in to replace the already successful MGA, this all new unitary construction 2-seater was powered by a 1798cc version of the BMC B series engine, which went on to power MGB & MGB GT models virtually unchanged (except for a 5 bearing crankshaft instead of 3 from 1964) for another 18 years. This engine was coupled to a 4-speed manual gearbox with an optional Overdrive on 3rd and 4th gears, suspension was by Coil Spring and Wishbones at the front and semi elliptic Leaf Springs at the rear, with Lever Arm Dampers all round. Front Disc Brakes were standard and it has Rack & Pinion Steering. The MGB range was finally discontinued in 1980, but the popularity of the MGB remains tremendous, with the model being well catered for by clubs and parts manufacturers and everything is still available including new body shells! This lovely MK1 'Pull Door Handle' MGB - Chassis no: G-HN3/44051 and Engine No: 18GA-RU-H/13003 is according to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate, a 'Matching Numbers' car and was built in Abingdon between 4th & 6th August 1964, despatched on 10th August 1964 to University Motors in London and we believe it was one of their demonstrators until being sold and registered to its first owner in London on 23rd June 1965 with its current number plate: EYM 296C. It is finished in its original colour of Tartan Red with Black Leather seats piped in Red, Red carpets Black Vinyl 'pack-away' Hood, Chrome Wire Wheels, Heater, Anti-Roll Bar and Overdrive. This car was in the previous but one ownership for 21 years but off the road in storage for almost 15 years during that time. It has certainly seen a high degree of cherished upkeep over its lifetime by its former keepers - only three in the last 32 years and 9 in total - and it was fully restored by MG specialist Bob Arkle between the spring of 1986 to the summer of 1989 and there is a plate riveted to the front panel in the engine bay to this effect. There are invoices in the history file for some parts purchased for the restoration and on completion it was MOT'd on 20th January 1990 with 00002 miles on the speedometer. It was MOT'd every year from 1990 through to 7th August 2005 with the Speedometer reading 7,874 Miles and we know it was then put into dry storage and only taken out in late 2021 when it was sold to the last owner. He gave the car to MG specialist LMG Kent Ltd and spent just over £2,300 with them on various works re-commissioning the car and it was last MOT'd in April 2022 with 'No advisories' which perhaps proves how good the car really is! It has many new parts including suspension and steering components + a new petrol pump, as all are visible from any inspection on a ramp and since we obtained the car, we have had it fully tuned and fitted a new 12v Bosch battery and a new chrome radio aerial. It comes with its original Steering Wheel which is quite rare plus a classic Pye Radio/Cassette player which works, 'fold-away' hood frame and soft top, an MG Car Cover, a full black vinyl Tonneau cover, period raised digit black and white number plates, Chrome Racing wing Mirrors, Chrome Luggage Rack and a Jack & Copper Hammer. The history file contains lots of invoices over the years including early MOT certificates plus its British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate confirming its original build details and specification. This is a very nice early 'Pull-Door-Handle' MGB and if it can be criticised at all, the last respray could have been better as it is suffering from some orange peel on the bonnet and rear deck/boot lid, but it is not drastic at all and overall it is a lovely car and really nice to drive and has only covered 8,000 miles since being rebuilt. It is clear on all HPi registers and upon sale it will come with a new MOT and our own 6 Month Mechanical Warranty and it is of course ULEZ compliant and Road Tax free!

During these seven years of production, four models were released that gradually became more modern, powerful and luxurious, or were only intended for use on the track. The Germans therefore have an eye for detail and luxury, which is directly reflected in the interior. They also know very well how to build cars, although new models often become controversial.\n\nThe first model was the BMW 2800 CS, a two-door coupé with a powerful 2.8L six-cylinder engine that delivers 170 hp. The design was based on the predecessor (and less popular) BMW 2000 CS. The sharp nose and horizontal lines create a sporty - later characteristic - BMW look. Just two years later, the BMW 3.0 CS was introduced, equipped with a new M30 engine, a 3.0L six-cylinder engine with 180 hp. In 1971, the 3.0 CS was the fastest road legal BMW, quickly catching the eye and being praised for its performance. The following year, the 3.0 CSL was released, the \"L\" referring to the word \"Leicht,\" which means “light” in German, the L was embodied in the light aluminium body and aerodynamic adjustments. This model won every edition of the European Touring Car Championship from 1974 to 1979. Shortly after the introduction of the CSL, Bayerische Motoren Werke also released an equivalent, meant to be sold to customers. This E9 variant was named CSi and was built for four years. This model had more luxury in general: a range of options such as automatic transmission and electric windows. Mechanically, the car is equipped with a 2986 cc in-line six-cylinder engine that delivers 200 hp.\n\nThe sporty design by Wilhelm Hofmeister, the high-performance engine that provides a never-boring driving experience, and the typical BMW look - originating from the home region - on which the BMW 6-series is based today, make this classic car highly sought after by enthusiasts.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 466 (183 inch)\nWidth (cm): 169 (67 inch)\nHeight (cm): 136 (54 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 262 (103 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1374 (3029 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 2986 cc straight-six front-engine\nValve gear: 12\nFuel system: Bosch fuel injection\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 200 hp (149 kW) at 6000 t/m\ntorque: 271 Nm at 4300 t/m\nTop speed: 224 km/h (139 mph)"}

{"name": "1986 BMW M5 SHADOW - €69,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 107400 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Hand-built\nFull-black ‘Shadow’ edition\nComes with all authentic BMW booklets\nThe BMW E28, introduced in 1981, succeeded the E12 series that had yet represented earlier the BMW 5 Series. Even though the design of the E12's predecessor had not drastically altered in the creation of the E28, it did introduce countless new innovations. Additionally, the eye-catching M badge in the mid-'80s became an integral part of BMW's performance lineup, therefore also the E28 could not leave without an M badge.\n\nThe E28 did not differ greatly in terms of aesthetics from its predecessor, but it was built in a crucial period for BMW. The 1980s marked a pivotal era for technological advancement, cutting-edge innovation, active car safety, and a redefined thinking about ‘driver’s luxury’. It all started at the car's designing itself, which was partly done using computer-aided design, or CAD, from the early days, as well as finite element analysis used to anticipate on the behaviour of vehicle safety features. The E28 became the first BMW to feature an onboard computer, airbags for the driver, and the world-famous ABS (antilock braking system).\n\nThe E28, which by the way was available in fourteen different models, not only brought technological marvels to life but also received praise from numerous journalists for BMW's commitment to enhancing performance on all fronts. The interior design of the E28 was also highly acclaimed, emphasizing the utmost comfort for the driver.\n\nIn 1984, the E28 underwent a facelift, it became more aerodynamic as of changes to bumper details. Buyers had the option for a catalytic converter, a driver's airbag was also introduced. The ingenious engineering of the E28 was further refined until it was succeeded by the BMW E34.\n\nMore than seven hundred thousand E28’s were sold, solidifying BMW's mastery of the market. The E28 was pragmatically designed and met the demand and desire of nearly every customer perfectly.\n\nBMW E28 M5\n\nAs mentioned, the iconic M from BMW M became an integral part of BMW's lineup. In 1985, the M5 was released, offering not only an eye-catching appearance but also a reworked version of the 3.5-liter straight-six engine from the M1. This engine made the E28 M5 one of the fastest cars on the market.\n\nAlthough the E28 series got succeeded in 1987, production of the E28 M5 continued until 1988. Reportedly, 2,241 E28 M5’s were produced, making them quite rare, elevating the E28 M5 to the status of the ultimate classic.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 462 (182 inch)\nWidth (cm): 170 (67 inch)\nHeight (cm): 140 (55 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 263 (104 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1430 (3153 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 3453 cc straight-six front-engine\nValve gear: 24\nFuel system: Bosch Motronic\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 282 hp (210 kW) at 6500 t/m\ntorque: 340 Nm at 4500 t/m\nTop speed: 245 km/h (152 mph)"}

Its angular and sporty design characterized BMW's designing style. With the arrival of the E36 as its successor BMW shifted to rounder shapes. The E30 is the last 3-series that offered the iconic BMW design that is adored by enthusiasts.\n\nWhile its predecessor, the E21, offered a range of variants with different engines in two body styles, the E30 even took it a step further. BMW's goal with this mid-range car was clear. They wanted to create a culture of variety by offering a wide range of engines and configurations, producing cars that satisfy everyone’s needs, and they succeeded, as a variety of engines, transmissions, and four body styles were introduced. From a 1.6-litre straight-four to a 2.7-litre straight-six engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission to a manual five-speed. The E30 lineup included a sporty coach, a sedan, a practical wagon, a convertible, and a true track beast that was designed with a little help from BMW M, who were no strangers to high-performance cars. In 1985, the E30 series expanded, introducing a more powerful diesel car and a convertible. In 1987, the wagon version was added, more powerful engines were made, rust protection quality significantly improved, and mechanical efficiency was enhanced.\n\nMore than two million E30’s were sold. From fall 1990, the E30 was succeeded by the E36, although some E30 variant were still produced in parallel until 1994.\n\nBMW E30 M3\n\nThe sporty design of the E30 did not pass BMW M(otorsport) unnoticed. In 1986, they enhanced the E30 series with a generous dose of sportiness, and surprisingly, that dose was produced by a four-cylinder engine, and no six-cylinder, as that would have negatively affected the M3's handling. The used straight-four was based on the six-cylinder from the E28 M5. A 2302 cc engine, producing 200 horsepower, was designed to power the E30 M3.\n\nIn 1985, at the Frankfurt Auto Show, jaws dropped as BMW M unveiled their E30 M3. It was crafted by blending elements from both the DTM racing cars they had been producing and the regular E30 BMW series, although it drastically differed from the standard E30. It was noticeably wider, larger, and sportier. Behind the wheel of the M3, its true track-ready nature becomes evident as it offers immense grip, it is highly responsive, and it feels very solid on its wide tires.\n\nOver the years, the power gradually increased. In 1990, the engine displacement grew to 2.5 litres, and the power output rose to 238 horsepower. In 1991, production was discontinued. The E30 M3 had been available as a sedan, coupe, and convertible, the convertible remains the rarest as only 786 of a total of 18,000 M3’s ever produced were convertibles.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 435 (171 inch)\nWidth (cm): 168 (66 inch)\nHeight (cm): 137 (54 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 257 (101 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1200 (2646 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: straight-four 2302 cc front-engine\nValve gear: 16\nFuel system: Bosch ML-Motronic\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 235 hp (175 kW) at 6750 t/m\ntorque: 240 Nm at 4600 t/m\nTop speed: 241 km/h (150 mph)"}

As a subsidiary of the Husqvarna armaments firm, the company began producing motorcycles in 1903 at Huskvarna, Sweden. Although they also produced road bikes, they were involved with racing from the early days and achieved much success and respect in the 1960s and 70s, when they became a major force in motocross and enduro competitions, winning 14 motocross World championships, 24 European enduro championships, and 11 Baja 1000 victories. By 1977 the Husqvarna business had become part of Sweden’s giant Electrolux Group and 10 years later, in 1987, production ceased in Sweden, with the sale of the motorcycle division to the Cagiva MV Agusta Group - production being transferred to Varese, Italy. In the mid-70s, the Husqvarna factory developed new power plants in two versions – a WR unit (Wide Ratio) for enduro/offroad riding and a CR outfit (Close Ratio) for motocross. This 250WR is a 1983-year model, powered by a 245cc single cylinder, air-cooled 2-stroke. It has never been registered for road use. \n\nHusqvarnas of this period are generally well-regarded for their build quality, strength and durability. This bike has had a relatively recent engine and suspension refresh and has undertaken just two events since. It appears stock in all respects except the fitment of an aftermarket silencer.\nThis classic twin-shock enduro bike from the 80’s is in a good, original condition and runs well.

Visually, the car appeared little changed throughout production, although the last models – as in this case – received 16-inch wheels and integrated bumpers front and rear. \n\nThis particular vehicle has spent almost all its life in the island of Guernsey, having been registered there in February 1996. The fastidious owner had the car serviced and maintained by Rolls Royce specialists Hillier Hill, of Olney, Bucks. In 2014, the car was acquired by the Guernsey government for use by the Lieutenant Governor (the Monarch’s representative in the island). As such, the car was chauffeur driven and only covered a limited additional mileage. It was serviced by Le Riche Auto in Jersey on a regular basis.\n\nThe Silver Spirit is in excellent mechanical condition and has covered a relatively lowly 41,000 miles – confirmed by the service and maintenance records held on file. This car has a full service history and has been maintained regardless of cost. The brake system was rebuilt in 2021 and rear suspension spheres replaced just this year to keep the vehicle in tip-top driving condition.\n\nAs might be anticipated for a chauffeur-driven limousine, the bodywork has been regularly valeted and kept in a very good condition. The sumptuous interior is finished in Magnolia leather with burgundy carpets and is in a first-class condition.\n\nThere’s no denying that every Rolls Royce has a certain road presence and this very smart, low mileage and well maintained vehicle has it in spades!

Bowler think they produced 15 in all and this is number 009, that underwent conversion from a standard 90 XS to emulate the rally cars in 2014.\nThe spec includes:\nMechanical:\n\n•\tBowler 170 bhp conversion with revised intercooler and exhaust system\n•\tBowler quick gearshift\n•\tBowler fast road suspension kit\n•\tBowler big brake kit\n•\tBowler 170 bhp conversion with revised intercooler and exhaust system\n•\tBowler quick gearshift\n•\tBowler fast road suspension kit\n•\tBowler big brake kit\nExternal:\n\n•\tBowler race bumper and steering guard\n•\tBowler anthracite 18in wheels shod with a matching set of 265/65 R18 BF Goodrich tyres\n•\tBowler race side rails\n•\trally mudflap kit\n•\tBowler bonnet lettering\n•\tLED light kit\nSo far, so Bowler in that all the above could be fitted to any Defender if you have deep pockets. But what really sets the Rally Challenge editions apart from the usual upgrades Bowler is the interior, in that, with the exception of the upgraded door cards that the actual rally ones wore, the interior is pretty much as per the rally cars, including:\n\n•\tFull internal MSA-approved roll cage\n•\tBowler race seats\n•\tTerratrip mount\n•\tMomo suede steering wheel\n•\t4 point harnesses (although the original seat belts are still fitted)\n•\tIntercom system (not tested)\n•\tFully plumbed in fire extinguisher system (not tested) \n•\tCB radio (not tested) \nAs the rear bulkhead has been completely removed and replaced with the roll cage, there’s plenty of room for taller drivers. In fact it’s one of most comfortable Defenders I’ve ever driven. \nThis one started life in Rimini Red metallic, but a previous owner decided the colour didn't really suit it's rip-snorting nature, so had it professionally wrapped in Nardo Grey.\nBeing originally an XS, it has ABS and traction control, air conditioning and the winter pack inc heated front screen, although the original heated seat elements haven't been transferred to the race seats. Also remote alarmed locking and electric front windows. It also has an uprated stereo system.\nOdometer reading just 38000 miles in the hands of 3 owners from new, and has MOT to February 2024, with no advisories. \nComes with the full book pack including correspondence with Bowler, and 2 sets of keys and remotes\nLast serviced Feb 2023 at 37705m\nNew clutch and flywheel fitted Nov 2021 at 35882m\nOverall, a fantastic Bowler Defender – driving it is a revelation if you’re used to standard ones.

Ideal as a starter classic, and also ideal for someone who may already have classic cars but would like a small sporty run around for those days with the sun shining, and the need to nip down to the shops for a few odds and ends. Simply pop the roof down, hop in and the drive to the shop on those errands couldn’t be easier or more pleasant.\n\nThis car, finished in British Racing Green is in simply stunning condition. It comes with a tan interior which compliments the exterior, and makes a very pleasant change from black. The paintwork simply gleams. The finish has almost got a glass like lustre. Obviously a combination of great paint finish and year of polish and elbow grease. It is fitted with the correct wheels, and these have been recently renovated.\n\n\nThere is a massive history file with the car detailing the work that’s been done over the years. And the car had a huge rebuild in 1999, with a bill at that time for over £1600, and it’s only done around 12000 dry miles since., and is of course Road Tax Exempt.\n\nAll the tyres are in great shape, and this little car drives superbly, and with only 6 former keeper it perhaps shows that with such low ownership for a forty year old car that its been liked so much by those previous keepers they didn’t part with it very often.\n\nThis little gem can be yours for only £7995, is this the car you always promised yourself?"}

It also has it's period Radiomobile radio, and a rudimentary period cruise control system fitted, although we haven't tested this. What really sets this one apart is that had just one private owner for 40 years up to 2020, who cherished it and used it carefully and sparingly since having it restored by a Rover specialist in 2001 -- according to old MOT's it's covered around 21000 miles since. The restoration included a reconditioned engine and gearbox, plus the usual structural and cosmetic work, followed by a full repaint in the original colours.It only had 2 keepers prior to his ownership. Current odometer reading 51000 miles which we think is really 151000, so it's being sold as 'mileage incorrect' to avoid any misunderstandings. The V5 now shows just 3 previous owners. History-wise we have a massive folder as thick as a telephone directory of bills and old MOT's etc dating back to at least 1980, including detailed notes on the 2001 restoration. We also have the owner's handbook and maintenance manual. In 2021-22, it's had major expenditure mechanically, including, but not limited to:*New (uprated) alternator*New engine mounts*New differential seals*Power steering pump overhauled*Shock absorbers replaced*And lastly, in October 2022, the engine and gearbox were removed to enable the automatic gearbox to be fully overhauled, and then refitted. .Interior-wise it's largely original (with the exception of new front kick panels and carpet mats)  and rather lovely if showing some signs of age related patina (and yes, the toolkit is in place). Paintwork-wise there are a few areas that are beginning to show that it's over 20 years since it was restored, and it's priced accordingly,  but it's still a lovely example in my opinion.

He did however have it repainted in the original colour 5 years ago as the original paint had faded badly. \n\nA lot of enthusiasts regard the 1.6 as having a rather better balance between handling and power than the 1.9 – I had a lot of experience of both back in the day and I always preferred the more revvy nature of the 1.6, and they’re just as much fun to hustle along. .  \n\nAs a 1.6, there’s no power steering as it’s not necessary, and on this one, manual windows and no central locking. Apart from the factory sunroof, which works as it should in that you can feel the seal releasing, and the correct alloys.  it’s as basic as it should be, and completely standard with the exception of a) the full-width reflective tail panel and b) a 1990’s style alarm system which was put in at some point in the dim and distant, and which we haven’t tried to use. Even the rear parcel shelf hasn’t been cut about.\n\nIt's been little-used over the past few years due to illness, but has always been garaged and MOT’d every year, and we’re prepared to warrant the odometer reading of just 76000 miles as genuine. \n\nHistory-wise we have the original book pack, including the original service book with 12 stamps in it, a large sheaf of servicing and maintenance bills, every MOT back to 1991, and even the original purchase invoice from when the last owner bought it from his local Peugeot dealer in 1991 for the princely sum of £6495, including an £895 allowance for his Austin Montego in part exchange.

However, the 1995 Mini Cooper you're referring to is part of the model's revival and reintroduction under the ownership of the Rover Group.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Rover Group, which included the Mini brand, was acquired by BMW. BMW recognized the iconic status of the Mini but also saw the need for a modern update to appeal to contemporary consumers. The result was the launch of the new Mini Cooper in 1994 as part of the Mark VII Mini series.\n\nThe 1995 Mini Cooper, officially known as the Mini Cooper 1.3i, was a sportier and more performance-oriented version of the classic Mini. It featured a 1.3-liter fuel-injected engine, providing improved power and responsiveness compared to the standard Mini models. The Cooper was available in both the classic Mini body style and a longer-wheelbase version known as the Mini Cooper 1.3i Sports Pack.\n\nThe 1995 Mini Cooper retained the distinctive design elements that made the original Mini so popular, including its compact size, transverse engine layout, and front-wheel-drive configuration. The Mini Cooper also featured bold racing stripes, contrasting roof colors, and alloy wheels, emphasizing its sporty character.\n\nThe reintroduction of the Mini Cooper in the 1990s was met with enthusiasm, and the model quickly gained a reputation for its fun-to-drive nature and iconic design. The success of the modern Mini Cooper eventually led to the development of subsequent generations, and the brand continued to be under BMW's ownership.\n\nThis 1995 Mini Cooper is in outstanding condition for its age and being a Japanese import it comes with a number of standard extras not seen with UK supplied Minis of this era. with the 1270cc engine and manual transmission finished in British Racing Green with the Cooper laurels and strips and black half Leather interior trim. 12\" Mini Lites wheels and air conditioning with much more to offer then just a Mini.

{"name": "1960 DAIMLER SP250 DART - £34,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 17900 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Daimler SP250 was launched as the 'Daimler Dart' at the New York Motor Show in April 1959 (and unofficially voted as the ugliest car at the show) although preliminary details and pictures first appeared in ‘The Motor’ on 1st April 1959. Unfortunately, its baptism at the New York Show was overshadowed by the Chrysler Corporation objecting to Daimler’s use of the name ‘Dart’, as Chrysler had previously registered that name for one of its own in-house Dodge models, therefore it became known as the SP250 which was its production type number, but affectionately it has always been called the 'Daimler Dart'. The Metropolitan Police recognised the 120mph plus capability of the car and they purchased 26 Black Daimler Dart's which were used as 'high speed' chase cars and the mere sight of a black SP250 was more than sufficient to quell an errant speeding car driver and the 'ton-up' biker dashing around the North Circular Road in London near the notorious Ace Café. The SP250 had a Fibreglass Body mounted on a Ladder frame Chassis and had a 2547cc V8 Engine with Hemispherical Aluminium Cylinder Heads and a 5 main bearing Crankshaft and it produced 140bhp @ 5800 rpm with a Maximum Torque of 155lbs ft. This was mated to a 4 Speed Manual Gearbox with an optional Overdrive or with an Automatic Transmission. Due to the fact that almost 50% of production would be destined for the USA and Canada, a large number of the car's features were optional extras to save on import duties into the United States. See the Owners Club page for more detailed information on the car: https://daimlersp250dartownersclub.com/history/ According to the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust production record, this lovely 'A' Spec Daimler SP250 Dart - Chassis No: 100689 was built on 27th April 1960 and supplied by Daimler dealers Spink Motors in Bournemouth to a Mr Dennis Alsop and first registered on 2nd May 1960 with his private number plate DA 12. It is finished in its original colour of Rochester Red with a Black vinyl interior and also comes with its original and optional factory Hardtop in Black, Smiths heater, Wire Wheels and Overdrive Gearbox. Mr Alsop kept the car for nearly 50 years and did have a restoration carried out on the car before selling it to Classic Automobiles in Wandsworth, London in 2009, but unfortunately, little is known of the car's history during Mr Alsop's ownership as the early paperwork had been lost. His number plate DA 12 was taken off in 2007 and it was re-registered with period plate 6516 EL. The car was subsequently sold by Classic Automobiles to a Mr Aldo Salvade in Italy who had a small collection of Classic Cars and there is correspondence in the file from him regarding the car and works carried out by him whilst in his ownership. Works included an engine and gearbox rebuild along with a new clutch, water pump and numerous other parts and there are invoices for all parts in the history file. The Dart spent ten years with Mr Salvade at his home in Tuscany until he sold the car in 2018 to his English neighbour who had the car transported back to his home in Stratford Upon Avon. The car was then re-registered back on its original number plate 6516 EL and was eventually sold in April 2019 to Evoke Classics in London. They had the car completely repainted in July 2019 along with some other works and sold it to the last owner from Bristol in August 2019. We sold the car to a car collector in 2022, but due to personal reasons, he is having to sell his collection and we have been given the car to sell for him. The car is in lovely condition and comes with its original tonneau cover & hood cover and its original black factory hard top which was also renovated and repainted to the same standard as the rest of the car. The interior is lovely and it has a brand new set of Chrome Wire Wheels with the correct and period B F Goodrich tyres. The car really does drive and present very well and it has now covered circa 3,000 miles since the engine and gearbox were rebuilt. It comes with a very good history file containing lots of old invoices, MOT certificates and a number of old Tax Discs, Heritage Trust Production Trace Certificate, photographs of the car completely stripped for repainting in 2019 and its previous ownership history. It is also clear on all HPi records and comes with the HPi certificate. The SP250 is a very reliable car and they are great fun to drive and perfect for touring around the UK and Europe. They are also a pretty rare site on our roads today as only 2,654 cars were built between 1959 and 1964 before production finished and half of these were exported, so they have started to become very collectible.

Since new it has travelled less than 2,500 miles and is presented in excellent condition.\n\nUnveiled in 2002, the MG SV-R was to be the new halo car for post-BMW MG. The SV story began with MG/Rover’s acquisition of the Italian-based Qvale Automotive, manufacturer of the Qvale Mangusta. The Mangusta had already been homologated for the US market so must have seemed an ideal starting point for MG’s proposed new supercar. The first MG X80 concept car was unveiled in 2001, but designer Peter Stevens went back to the drawing board to re-style the SV production version along more aggressive looking lines. Like the Mangusta, the SV used carbon fibre body panels, which were manufactured in the UK and then shipped to Italy for fitting to the box-frame chassis. Completed cars were then transported to the MG Rover factory at Longbridge for final trimming and finishing. Power was supplied by a Ford V8 engine producing 320bhp; performance figures of 5.3 seconds for the 0-60mph dash and a top speed of 165mph were claimed. There was also a more powerful (385bhp) SV-R version capable of 175mph. Production commenced in 2003 with the SV base model priced at a fraction under £66,000. Sadly, the SV had arrived too late to help rescue MG, and when the factory closed its gates in 2005 only 82-or-so cars plus four ‘XP’ pre-production prototypes had been made\n\nNow available for viewing at the DD Classics Dealership in London, please call 0208 878 3355 for more information.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the above information but errors may occur.

It was supplied new by S.G.M. Garages Ltd of Newcastle Upon Tyne to its first owner at Conforth Developments Ltd on the 24th September 1973. Letters from Tony Willis at the Maranello Concessionaires Archive and copies of the original build sheet confirm that chassis #06964 was finished in Argento Auteuil with a Nero interior. Also specified were 2 door mirrors, Perspex headlight covers, radio, 2 speakers and an electric aerial which all remain to this day.\n\nFollowing two further owners, the car was purchased by John Harris, the sound engineer for rock band Queen. It is believed that Queen's song \"I'm in Love with My Car\" was written about Mr Harris and his attachment to his Dino. In the early 1980s after Mr Harris' ownership came to an end the car was purchased by a Mr J. Ford who had the car completely restored by Rosso Ltd, leading to a Concours class win in 1982 at the Ferrari Owners Club, Eastington Hall Concours.\n\nIn 2008, the Dino was owned by a Mr N. Freeman who decided the Ferrari could do with a bit of attention. An engine rebuild was at the top of the list which was carried out in May 2008 by a Ferrari specialist who entirely removed and dismantled the engine and cleaned, machined and replaced parts where necessary. A detailed invoice for ~£13,000 and a set of photographs document all the work that was carried out. In the same year the suspension and braking system received a full overhaul along with some bodywork repairs generating three further invoices totalling ~£14,000. The stunning 246 GTS was also returned to its original colour scheme and the same Ferrari specialists were again chosen to complete a full glass-out respray totalling £18,000 as confirmed by an invoice on file.\n\nIn 2018, a 700-mile round trip to the Le Mans Classic was completed in the Dino, performing effortlessly in the searing heat. \n\nOur lovely 246 Dino GTS is supplied with the following;\n\nDriver's manual\nBookpack\nExtensive history file\nShowing 62,300 miles, this has to be one of the finest examples available today.

And the oldest category car which needed to be replaced was the 2+2 which meant replacing the Ferrari 456 which had been in production since 1992. And so, Ferrari set this considerable task to Japanese Pininfarina designer, Ken Okuyama who had already paved the way for a new millennium of Ferrari products with the Enzo and the design language that came with it. In 2004, Ferrari launched the elegant, sleek and sophisticated 612 Scaglietti, named proudly after the former design house responsible for some of Ferrari’s most iconic models of the Golden Age. Mr Okuyama did a fine job indeed.\n\nWhilst the 612 was definitively modern in its styling, it also paid homage to classical Ferrari proportions from the 50s and in the subtle side scallops and headlight design, giving a nod to the stunning Ferrari 375MM commissioned by Roberto Rossellini for his Hollywood icon wife, Ingrid Bergman. Despite the classic elegance, the 612 was no dinosaur, being the second all aluminium Ferrari model and under its long swooping bonnet, cradled a 5.7 litre, 533 horsepower V12 that pushed the 612 to still impressive figures of a top speed of 199 mph and reaching 62 mph in just 4 seconds, numbers which still bring a trickle of sweat to modern counterparts and rivals.\n\n612 bodies were produced in the former Scaglietti plant (a further tribute to its glorious namesake) in Modena before transport and completion at the main Ferrari factory in Maranello. Production lasted from 2004 to 2011 and in this time, a mere 3,025 were produced making the Scaglietti a rare beast indeed though, from 2008, their exclusivity only increased further. In 2007, the Scaglietti now featured a new SuperFast robotic (F1) 6-speed semi-automatic transmission, transforming the car for the better and thoroughly modernising the already impressive driving experience. \n\nThis Scaglietti is presented in a mesmerising colour combination of Grigio Titanio with Cuoio. We are delighted a car that could’ve roared out of Maranello only yesterday, having covered a mere, conscientious 4,000 miles hence the car is in such a beautiful state today.\n\nNow available for viewing at the DD Classics Dealership in London, please call 0208 878 33 55 to book an appointment.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the above information but errors may occur.

Leland's job was to sift through the remaining assets. He did so and convinced investors they could still be a viable company using his proven one-cylinder engine. In honour of Leland's distant ancestor and founder of Detroit, the company was rechristened the Cadillac Automobile Company. Precision manufacturing, reliability, and parts interchangeability became Cadillac's hallmark. While perhaps hard to fathom today, the concept of interchangeable parts was a novel idea back then. Cadillac's reputation grew as did the demand for more powerful cars. Cadillac's introduction of V12 and V16 engines in 1930 kicked off a 'cylinder war' among American luxury car manufacturers.Cadillac's luxury image which rose to the very highest echelons in the 1930s would always remain with Cadillac and to this day, Cadillac are the staple American luxury car manufacturer. As with the aforementioned 'cylinder war' of the 1930s, in 1970, Cadillac launched the largest ever V8 in a post-war production car, a monstrous 8.2 Litre, 500 Cubic Inch V8, first used exclusively before becoming standard in all Cadillac models bar the Seville after 1975. The Cadillac Fleetwood, one of the cars which benefitted from this powertrain in 1975 was Cadillac's premiere Luxury Sedan, amongst the largest cars produced by Cadillac with the widest interior width for any car until 1990s GM models. Available with an endless list of options and equipment to rival most modern cars, there was only one thing that Cadillac's lineup lacked, a Station Wagon.Traditional Coachworks LTD of Chatsworth California noticed this and offered their take on a Cadillac Station Wagon. With factory endorsement, Cadillac Castillian's were sold new through Cadillac dealerships and would be sent as complete cars from the factory to Traditional Coachworks for them to convert the car to the highest of standards to Castilian Estate Wagon specifications. Featuring a large rear tailgate, a striking sloping roofline and even a surprisingly contemporary roof spoiler, the Castillian in no way detracted from the famed Cadillac lines, retaining them wherever it could, even in the shape of the tailgate which featured the same square bulge as the Fleetwood saloon. Complete cars came at a cost of close to twice the cost of a regular Cadillac Fleetwood, depending on options of course, often around $30,000. The exclusivity and wow factor of such a vehicle was enough to attract some Hollywood Showbusiness loyalty, for example of the 11 cars built in 1976, one was sold new to Dean Martin whilst another was sold new to Sammy Davis Jr. Their other main model was the Cadillac Mirage, a two-door pickup based on the Cadillac Coupe DeVille which sold in much higher numbers, selling to celebrities such as Evel Knievel.The car we present to you is not just one of only 11 cars built in 1976 but is by far and away one of the best examples in the world. Finished in a superbly elegant colour scheme of Cadillac Innsbruck Blue over superb original White leather interior with Navy Mouton Carpeting throughout, Station Wagons don't come any plusher or any more exclusive than this.The car comes with its original build sheet, showing it's pre-conversion specification and price of $12,533 with options including but not limited to Leather Upholstery, 6-Way Power Passenger Front Seat (Driver's power seat came standard), Tilt and Telescope Steering Wheel, Cruise Control, Twilight Sentinel, Turbine Vane Wheel Trims and numerous other options.The car reads as having covered 20,150 miles from new which we believe to be genuine not only due to the pristine condition of the Ivory White leather interior but in how it still drives like new and its all round presentation. It is a truly stunning automobile. So rarely do these exceptional Long-Roofs come up for sale and examples in such mint condition are impossibly scarce, this car is unquestionably a unique opportunity.

Have no doubt that this Tourer is a factory supplied example - not a car that has been subjected to a conversion !  We have known this car throughout its complete restoration being previously restored by a family friend with lots of knowledge about Morris Minors. The restoration was undertaken over a number of years with very keen attention to detail. The car has been dry stored throughout its restoration and to the present day. The car, presented in its factory Trafalgar Blue with Pearl Grey hood is a delight to see on the road and an even better experience behind the wheel. The bodywork is very good all round and the recently refurbished steel white wheels, matching white coachline and grill, along with the restored chrome trim and bumpers together complete the look of this spectacular little car. The car is rust free and was sealed underneath by us prior to its previous sale. In our opinion, there is no work to be completed by its next custodian. The interior of the car has had a complete retrim with exterior matched paint in the necessary places, blue/grey seats and all recent carpets along with a set of blue Morris Minor Owners Club floor mats. To the previous owners’ requirements, we also added a 12 volt and USB socket, an alternator conversion along with a new electronic ignition system. The hood folds up and down without any difficulties enabling the owner to use the car in our Great British weather conditions without any worry. Mechanically the car is sound with a valid MOT until January 2024. Prior to its last sale, we fitted a number of modifications and upgrades to the car including a new SU electronic fuel pump, Accuspark electronic ignition and alternator along with a new Lucas Classic battery. The 1098cc A-series engine runs without fault and starts first turn of the key. The 4-speed transmission is reactive and gear changes are smooth. Overall, the ride is very enjoyable, we have road tested the car on several occasions and have had no issues, just satisfaction. We have had many Morris Minors in and out of our doors and this car is one of the best we have seen. The car will be supplied with a fresh 12-month MOT, a service, heritage certificate and some previous paperwork. If this beautiful open tourer looks and sounds like the car for you, a trip to see us is well worth the visit – \"Our coffee pot is always hot\"."}

Matching the outstanding performance is a wonderful exhaust note, the MG sounds fantastic and is exceptional to drive.\nMechanically our MG is very strong with a Rover V8 engine that has been stripped down and rebuilt with new main and big end bearings in 2005. Since the engine rebuild the car has covered almost 10,000 miles. During conversion to V8 specification a 5 speed Rover gearbox was fitted along with a brand new clutch. Further upgrades include V8 manifold huggers, downpipes and a stainless steel exhaust. A re-conditioned rear axle was fitted along with 4 pot calipers and grooved brake discs to cope with the upgraded performance. The MG had new kingpins, Koni shock absorbers with Gaz struts and front and rear poly bushes. Electronic ignition, a new alternator and an MG RV8 distributor also add to the list of expenditure.\n\nVUB 905R presents very well and has been further enhanced by a chrome bumper conversion and the fitting of a honeycomb grill. Prior to selling the car back in 2013, it had recently undergone a professional re-paint and many years on the body is superb straight with superb panels and no rust issues. The paintwork has aged well with only the odd minor imperfections commensurate with general use and the many years since paintwork. The MG is nicely finished with Minilight style wheels and a very good hood that we fitted over ten years ago. The interior is of a lovely standard with high quality black leather seats, clean carpets and a walnut dashboard.\n\nOn the road this V8 is outstanding with lots of power and fantastic performance. The MG has superb acceleration and the five speed gearbox really enhances the car for longer distance touring . Importantly the brakes are sharp and very efficient, the suspension feels firm and offers a fabulous ride. The steering is very light, precise and drives like a car that has had thousands of pounds spent on mechanical work. Since last selling the car in 2013 it's been very well maintained with regular servicing and good upkeep to include new silicone coolant hoses, new brake hoses and overhauled carburettor. This MG offers an overall fantastic driving experience and we are delighted to once again offer it into the market."}

OYJ 451K first came to us last year and was driven to us from Norfolk covering 200 absolutely faultless miles, arriving with a warranted 31,500 miles from new with a wonderful, detailed history to include original service book, early service invoices, MOT records and general maintenance invoices throughout its life. Having been recently with one of our Somerset based regular customers, this stunning Alfa returns with 32,000 warranted miles.\nOYJ 451K was supplied new by Hamilton Brothers Limited of Glasgow Road Paisley on the 1st May 1972 to a Scottish gentleman of Italian descent, a Mr Seve Barbieri who kept the Alfa for an impressive 33 years, only selling the car in 2005 due to an end to his driving days. The cars first owner cherished the car and covered almost 23,000 miles during his ownership. The cars original service book records maintenance and stamps at 6424, 11150, 15574, 19977 and 22436 miles. Original Shell service reports from the 1970's are also on file at 752, 2987, 6424 and 9491 miles.\n\nDuring the later years with its first owner, the Alfa was maintained by the Chairman of the Scottish section of the Alfa Romeo Club who also owns Alfa Specialists CP Garage Services in Dundee. To this day, they still specialise in the service of Alfa Romeos and have an excellent reputation built on word of mouth within Alfa Romeo Club circles. In 2005, the very man, the Alfa Romeo trained proprietor of CP Garage Services purchased the car for himself and owned it until 2014 having taken the mileage to 29,000, service book stamped at 27505 with four other services also recorded by CP Garage Services. The Alfa was then purchased by a London based collector and enthusiast with a collection of first class, highly original low mileage cars.\n\nIt was in early 2015 the Alfa Romeo was sent to Alfa Supremo Ian Ellis for a full evaluation and £10,000 of work was carried out on the car to include new tyres, re-furbished wheels, re-conditioned starter motor, rebuilt cylinder head, engine mounts, new clutch, front and rear brake pads, lower ball joints and wishbone bushes, boot seal and boot mat set. The cars London owner later sold the car for it then to be maintained by Alfa specialists Automeo for its next owner who fitted two new weber carburettors and new ignition items, valuing the car at £65000 in 2021 and stating it was corrosion free and the best example they had worked on in 30 years as Alfa specialists. Having regretted selling the car, the London based collector who purchased the Alfa in 2015 bought the car back in 2021 and the car came to us after minimal use on fine days only with just 31500 miles from new. Since then a further faultless 500 miles have been covered.\n\nThis incredibly correct car is truly sensational and remarkably original, a perfect purchase for the discerning collector with its superbly documented full history and warranted low miles. The Cava Beige paintwork is of an excellent standard and the bodywork first class with exceptional original straight panels and structurally outstanding underside having had Ziebart injection treatment in its early life. The largely original upholstery is impressive, as is the well-presented engine bay. This early GTV 2000 displays its Tipo 105.22 and Bertone body number stampings on the boot scuttle, retains its original manufacturers rear window sticker and of course retains its impressive unrepeatable early history. This unrestored car is equally impressive on the road as demonstrated on its original 200-mile drive here, it feels tight, responsive, rattle and shake free and offers and first class driving experience with its top quality low mileage running gear. This is a true collector's piece and offers a unique opportunity to own one of the very best original examples in existence."}

With the birth of the Morgan +8 in 1968 one of the most exciting roadgoing up to that date saw the light of day. The story started with the purchase of the GM/Buick V8 engine by Rover. This small-block 3,5 Litre engine was re-engineered by Rover. The all-aluminium, compact, and light power unit, delivering just shy of 190 SAE bhp in standard (version for high octane petrol) form, proved to be the perfect engine for the ultra-light (1876 Lb/850 kg) Morgan +8 which was built on a reinforced Morgan +4 chassis. In 1976 the chassis was widened, and wider wheels were fitted. The evolution of the Rover V8 powered Morgan +8 ended in the year 2004 as the Rover V8 engine was discontinued.

I sold it to the previous owner who bought the car for the plate 1000RR I have the car back now and is up for sale again I would like to see it go to a good home. Finished in the beautiful Chrome Yellow with Red interior this 1980 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow 2 is one of the best for sale on the market. Chassis number RH0039623. The car is striking in it's livery of Chrome Yellow paint with Black Everflex roof, rear quarter badges and Scarlet hide interior with matching hide Wilton carpets with Scarlet Lambs wool rugs covering. This is all as originally specified. The motor car has an unrivalled pedigree having been owned for 34 years by prominent Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts’ Club (RREC) members in the Midlands who purchased from the first owners. The car undertook many overseas RRREC rallies. The car has recently spent a short spell with another long standing member of the RREC. As a result, there is a full service history dating back through the car’s life during which time it has been comprehensively maintained. In recent times, there have been new engine belts, a new set of Whitewall tyres and new battery. A new radio unit with Bluetooth in addition to the remaining original radio; new rear springs and adjustments to hydraulics/self-levelling; new brake hoses to one of the wheels. The car has four headrests and two front door mirrors. The air conditioning functions well, the Everflex roof is in good order and modern starter motor and head lights are fitted. This motorcar runs smoothly and turns heads wherever it goes. The Private plate 1000RR has been taken off the car, and I have had it put back onto BRN 552V we sold it to the previous owner who has the 1000RR Plate on his Cullinan. Call me Cormac on 07422686666 for more information. I’m asking £16,000 open to sensible offers I would like to see it go to a good home. "}

Today, we proudly present a fully restored specimen of this legendary machine, a testament to Honda's engineering prowess and the timeless appeal of two-wheeled adventures.\n\nThis particular Goldwing GL1000 isn't just a motorcycle; it's a piece of history. Hailing from its original American roots, this bike has undergone a meticulous restoration journey, ensuring every detail, every curve, every chrome piece shines with the same fervor as it did when it first graced the open roads.\n\nThe GL1000, renowned for its innovative design and groundbreaking features for its era, was Honda's bold answer to the touring motorcycle segment.\n\nFront wheel twin discs and another disc for the rear wheel too. Shaft drive was a change in direction for large and powerful motorcycles as well. Water cooling for the new 1 litre engine (the largest ever from Honda the time), was a new flat four design giving excellent power ( 78 bhp ) and also heaps of torque further down the rev range ( 62 ft/lbs ) - and a nice upside is the lovely note this 4 cylinder engine produces too.\n\n\nThe bicycle is big and heavy, but looking at her, and in the pictures too, you can see that actually she has a finesse of line, which really belies her size and weight\n\nRiding her, again she feels light and nimble, with true acceleration (remember she was the World's fastest accelerating production motorcycle - with the exception of the Z1, which was a sports bike anyhow) whilst the disc brake set up certainly pulls her up swiftly after a firm pull on the brake levers\n\nHer top speed would have been in the region of 120mph + and the acceleration, as listed above, was 0 - 60 mph covered in an amazing 4.9 seconds !!!\n\nWith the shaft drive there is no snatching from a chain either, so progress is very smooth and comfortable as well\n\nIn summation, this 1975 Honda Goldwing GL1000 is more than a motorcycle. It's a symbol of Honda's commitment to innovation, a tangible representation of motorcycling's golden era, and a unique opportunity for enthusiasts to own a slice of history.\n\nA motorcycle we would highly recommend.\n\nRemember, it's always the first or the last which brings out the finest of a line, and this being the first is what lead us to acquire her and offer her for sale"}

In 1959, British car manufacturer British Motor Corporation (BMC) released the Austin Mini, it is obvious that they had a clear goal in mind: releasing a small city-fit car with a cute design. Thanks to The Beatles and its starring in countless famous films, the car has acquired an iconic status over the decades.\n\nIt was Alec Issigonis, a British-Greek car designer that worked for BMC, who gave birth to the Mini. He had a clear goal in mind: to create an affordable and fuel-efficient car that is efficient and light-steering in narrow British city streets. This approach, along with the playful design, created a true hype among young people. The Mini also became extremely popular with influential people, to the point that all members of The Beatles - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr - proudly show off their Minis. In 1969, the car takes on the leading role in the film The Italian Job, in which bank robbers used a Mini as a getaway car. Also Mr. Bean’s car is a lime green 1977 Mini, which emphasizes his clumsiness in the best way possible.\n\nInitially, the Mini was manufactured in various finishes, such as a sedan, a station wagon, a van, and even a pickup truck. Those finishes never really became fancied among the crowd. Also, in the 1980s, the Mini began losing its fame due to fierce competition from other car brands. This caused a harsh financial crisis in 1986 at British Leyland - the former BMC that also own Jaguar, Rover, Triumph, and MG. They even decide to restructure and privatize the company and from that moment on Rover Group was born. In 1994, Rover Group sells Mini to BMW, which seven years later, in 2001, launch a refined version of the Mini. Nowadays BMW still produce the Mini – baring its British identity in mind – and it is available in various finishes: a convertible, a fully electric version, a hybrid version, a sports version, and even a station wagon.\n\nAs mentioned before, the goal was to build a city car that fit in traffic in cities, therefore they had to use as little space as possible, that was a real challenge in the middle of the 20th century. The 1950s are often considered a tipping point in automotive technology, and the Mini has contributed to that tipping point: a front-wheel drive car with a transverse and space-saving engine that is highly responsive and fit to city traffic.\n\nToday, the Mini is a coveted classic car, and not only among classic car enthusiasts. The cute and vulnerable design simply steals everyone's hearts.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 305 (120 inch)\nWidth (cm): 144 (57 inch)\nHeight (cm): 135 (53 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 204 (80 inch)\nWeight (kg): 635 (1400 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: Transverse in-line-four 1275 cc engine\nValve gear: 8\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: FWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 63 hp (46 kW) at 5700 t/m\ntorque: 95 Nm at 3900 t/m\nTop speed: 148 km/h (92 mph)"}

{"name": "1972 MG B ROADSTER - £12,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Quite possibly the best known small British sportscar of all time, the MGB was first introduced in 1964 – in Roadster form – and production continued until 1980, by which time over half a million (of all variants) had been produced. The car still has a large following to this day and a good support network through specialist suppliers and an owners club. Limited changes were made to the car prior to the substantial revision to its appearance from the 1974 model year, when the original chrome bumpers were replaced with new, steel-reinforced black rubber bumpers front and rear, to meet new US impact regulations. Throughout the model’s life, the 1800cc engine was rated at 95 bhp peak power at 5,400 rpm, with a 6,000 rpm redline. In 1968 the gearbox was uprated to offer full synchromesh on all 4 gears. This gave performance figures of a top speed around 105 mph, and a 0-60 mph time of around 12 seconds. This ‘chrome bumper’ model dates from 1972, having been first registered new in the UK in May of that year. We know nothing further of the car’s subsequent history until it was purchased by a Jersey resident and re-registered in the island in May 2019. \n\nThe car has clearly been well-cared for during its life with evidence under the vehicle of some body repair work having been carried out. The Teal Blue paintwork is not perfect, but quite presentable, with the wire wheels and all brightwork in a good condition. The foldaway hood is fully functioning.\n\nMechanically sound – with some work undertaken to ensure the car passed the rigorous local re-registration inspection. The car runs and drives very well. A stainless steel exhaust system has been fitted.\n\nAn attractive MGB Roadster with some extras fitted and in a good, solid condition, driving well and ready to go. This example would make a perfectly viable ‘daily-driver’. The car is currently Jersey registered and we can assist with shipping and importing processes if required. We can ship worldwide.\n\nThe black interior is in very good condition with a wood veneer dash cover fitted, uprated (and very comfortable) leather seats and an aftermarket steering wheel."}

Needs a gear linkage part swapped that I've got but mechanically it's fine to drive, just a little niggle. Has different front seats but the rest is standard. Was going to camper it but the rear seats fold down in line with the parcel shelf to sleep on, has tinted rear glass too. The middle seat comes out easy and leaves loads of space. Being an early Caravelle it's very well built and good spec, has electric windows and mirrors, it's built like a car with decent sound deadening etc. You can drive and talk easily, not like the usual builders wagons that can be like tin drums. I've sorted most of the little problems I've come across. Only issues left are the central locking motor for the sliding door, I have the door card for it that I took off and the sunroof has jumped it's rail, but that's a Summer fix. Has had a full respray after some panel work with new arches fitted, tailgate rear wiper delete, rides well on Passat 17's and looks well. Had a suspension kit that's on Red springs, have receipts for all the work I've listed here of course. It's a 30 year old vehicle and I'm sure there's more to it but nothing that stops you having fun in it. Sensibly priced as its got a 12 month MoT and drives well, v5 in my name of course.

Significant technical advances, including a new light-alloy subframe with a coil and wishbone suspension, an all new engine and newly standard 6 speed transmission, made significant progress in creating a more civilized car and a greatly improved driving experience. Designed by Tony Hatter, the 993 retained the classic 911 shape but featured updated exterior panels, significantly flared wheel arches, and a smoother front and rear bumper design. The aggressive stance of the wide-style body accommodated the new multi-link rear suspension which gave the car better stability. Newly improved handling made the car more planted and helped to reduce oversteer in cornering as well as improving ride quality and reducing interior noise. The acclaimed rear design sacrificed top speeds for better handling making it the perfect weekend partner to tackle the narrow, winding English country roads. Simply put, the new design and technical improvements meant the 993 generation Porsche hit the sweet spot between usability and fun.\n\nThe 993 turbo was introduced in 1995 and featured a new twin-turbocharged engine which brought the output up to 402 hp with the help of air-to- air intercoolers, electronic engine management, and redesigned cylinder heads. The 993 Turbo was the first to feature all wheel drive which was accommodated by wheel arches that were widened by approximately 6cm over the standard 993’s already enlarged arches. Most notably, the rear featured a fixed “whale tale” rear wing which housed the intercoolers and dramatically upped the 993 Turbo’s “cool” factor. The Turbo also featured larger brakes, new 18” alloy wheels, and was one of the first production cars in the world to feature the  OBDII diagnostics system which would later feature as standard on the base 993 models. Thanks to a host of updates and firsts, the Turbo is an exciting drive but the all wheel drive system means the car still feels in control. "}

From what we understand, only four C4s with this option were ever manufactured. \n\nThe 993 model year is famously the last of the air-cooled 911s and was redesigned from the ground up, only borrowing 20% of its parts from the previous generation.

{"name": "2011 PORSCHE 997 GT3 RS 4.0 - £345,000 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 12000 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "1 of 600 made and a superbly desirable collectible Porsche!\n\n11,000 Miles\n4.0 Ltr\nGrandprix white Coachwork\nBlack with Red Sports Bucket seats\nRed Seats Belts\nPorsche Stability Management System\nPorsche Active Suspension Module\nPorsche Communication Module-PCM 3\nTouch screen Satellite Navigation\nTelephone\nChrono Pack\nSports Exhausts\nClimate Control\n19\" GEN II 997 GT3 Alloys\nFull Porsche Service History     \n\nThe 997 generation’s biggest updates were the interior and exterior styling, most notably the return to the “bug eye” round highlights of the 911 and 993 generations. The slightly widened body and larger 18” wheels gave the 997s a more aggressive stance, and they all benefited from slightly increased power. Inside, the design was similarly reminiscent of the pre-996 generation design. The return to traditional styling makes the 997 generation feel like an homage to the iconic and prolific original 911s, yet the futuristic and modern technology and engineering make it a car firmly rooted in the present. The 997 is truly the best of both worlds, a modern car in a subtly classic body, an eye on the past but a nod to the future. \n\nAfter six years of testing both on the road and track, Porsche released the jewel of the 997 generation’s crown. At the time of its build, the GT3 RS 4.0 L featured the most powerful naturally aspirated flat-six Porsche had on offer, and after a strict diet, lost a further 22lbs past the original RS reduction making it the most radical iteration of road going Porsche 911s.\n\nThe 997 GT3 variant debuted at the 2006 Geneva Motorshow alongside the Turbo model. The GT3 model line was introduced as a way for Porsche to offer race cars for customer teams and homologate new aero features for racing. The Aerodynamic features on this model include a special front bumper with canards which increase cooling to the front mounted radiators and split spoiler at the rear, as well as a special bumper and centralised tailpipes that help draw heat away from the engine. The engine cover has been enlarged and features an additional air intake underneath the similarly enlarged rear wing.\n\nThis generation GT3 RS is regarded as one of the best cars Porsche has ever created and its Mezger engine is one of the reasons why. Mezger engines are the most revered iteration of the flat-six overhead-camshaft engines and whilst all other 911s adopted a new and somewhat problematic design, the GT cars stuck with it. Having proven itself by winning Le Mans in the 911 GT1-98, the engine was proving to be unbreakable, and to top it all off, sounded fantastic. The other reason the 997 generation GT3 is considered one of the best is because it was the last with the six-speed manual gearbox that had been a hallmark of its predecessors. The engine and the gearbox mark the end of an era for Porsche and place the GT3 RS 4.0L firmly in the company's history books.\n\nThis GT3 RS 4.0L is number 211 of 600. 211 was purchased new in Germany by a collector who wished to acquire a very high spec, limited edition, Porsche 911. He was particularly interested in acquiring a 997 GT3 RS because he knew that Porsche were phasing out the 911 six speed manual gearbox and the iconic Mezger engine and this would be the last model with both. The vehicle was first registered in Germany and holds a full Porsche service history. As it stands the vehicle has 11,000 miles on the odometer and was optioned with ceramic brakes, black and red sports bucket seats, red seat belts, Porsche stability management system, Porsche active suspension module, Porsche communication module PCM-3, touch screen satellite navigation, chronopack, sports exhausts, rollbar and the 19” Gen II 997 GT3 alloys. During 211’s four-year stint under our ownership, the vehicle has been serviced and looked after by the top engineer from the Porsche centre at Hatfield who has recently carried out a major service and complete check on the car, certifying it is working perfectly.\n\n211 featured in the Total 911 article ‘Porsche 997 GT3 RS vs RS 4.0: Rennsport Masters. RS, short for Rennsport, evokes certain emotions in all Porsche lovers. It conjures up images of long days of motorsport-derived excitement at the hands of a world-class engine and 211 is happy to oblige. It drives beautifully and will look just as exciting on a show lawn as it does on the road."}

The perfect combination of beauty, high performance and reasonable pricing made it one of the most well-loved cars of all time. Based on the  three-consecutive Le Mans winning D-type race cars, the E-type was designed to be light. The front subframe carried the engine and the front suspension and bodywork were bolted directly to the tub making its power to weight ratio the stuff of legend. Updated to include a new 5.3 L V12 engine, new brakes and power steering as standard, the Series 3 retained all the charm of the original E-types but with modernised mechanics. The stunning new V12 was a LeMans proven set up with dual Zenith carburettors and a 0-60 time of less than 7-seconds. The Series 3 had some notable design features including the large cross-slatted front grille, flared wheel arches, four exhaust tips and a special badge on the rear touting the prowess of the thunderous V12 inside. \n\nForever an iconic piece of British history, the E-type evokes images of winding country roads and the elegance of a bygone era. This immaculately kept, matching numbers, low mileage example is the perfect weekend partner rain or shine. Expertly specced in Signal Red over black, the red piping on the perforated leather seats creates a holistic experience encouraging you to have the top down year round. With only 12,000 miles on the odometer since a major restoration and only 6 former owners, this car is the perfect example of a Series 3 E-Type Roadster."}

{"name": "2013 PORSCHE 911 CARRERA 4S CABRIOLET - £63,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Using the Porsche mantra of “Evolution, not revolution” alive, the 991 Series kept a close visual link to its 997 predecessors but actually moved the game forward a very long way. Designed by 993 stylist Tony Hatter, with a longer and wider track, the 991 brought elegance back to the 911 cars. The longer wheelbase improved stability, and the wider track meant that a slightly milder anti-roll bar can be employed at the front, thus reducing the tendency to understeer, an inherent 911 trait.  The revised front and rear running gear combined with the larger dimensions made the 991 a different handling Porsche to the 997, particularly in terms of stability. The 4-wheel drive system enhances this all-round usability.\n\nClever use of aluminium panels, (the skin is 45 % aluminium and magnesium), has enabled Porsche to reduce the weight of the Carrera from the 1,455kg of the 997 to 1,415kg for the equivalent 991 model, which is quite an achievement given that 58kg of additional ‘safety products’ had to be added to the new version. Also noticeable is the raised centre console housing the gearshift, a development first seen on the Carrera GT and more recently extended to the Cayenne and the Panamera. The handbrake lever has also disappeared, replaced by an electric parking brake. The combination of more space and richer materials has elevated the 911’s cockpit to a distinctly ‘grand touring’ environment rather than that of a mere topflight sports car. Performance figures give a top speed of 186 mph, and a 0 - 62 mph acceleration time of 4.1 secs.\n\nSupplied new by Porsche Centre Mayfair, London in February 2013, this one owner 991 Carrera 4S Cabriolet has a large factory options list, (original invoice in history file), full servicing history (5 services) and both remote keys.  Our 991 Carrera 4S Cabriolet represents excellent Porsche value for its new owner. With these naturally aspirated Porsches becoming ever-more desirable, this Porsche presents a real opportunity.

A concept car, known as \"Project Vantage\" and the first Aston Martin design wholly designed by Callum, was built to display the company's vision for a future sports car that could represent Aston Martin's aspirations after the discontinuation of the supercharged Vantage. The concept car evolved directly into the V12 Vanquish, and featured an advanced carbon fibre and alloy structure, and Aston Martin's most powerful V12 engine,\n\nThe naturally aspirated 60° DOHC 4 valves per cylinder V12 engine with a bore and stroke of 89 mm × 79. 5 mm (3. 50 in × 3. 13 in) effortlessly produced at least 466 PS (343 kW; 460 hp) at 6, 500 rpm and 400 lb?ft (542 N?m) of torque at 5, 000 rpm.[4] It is controlled by a drive-by-wire throttle and driven by a 6-speed automated manual transmission. The Vanquish model debuted with 355 mm (14. 0 inches) drilled and ventilated disc brakes with four-piston callipers, ABS, with electronic brake distribution. The interior featured full instrumentation, advanced electronics, and a choice of leather upholstery with metallic details\n\nThe Vanquish production ended in 2007 marking the end of an era of cars produced at Newport Pagnell Buckinghamshire.\n\nIts appearance in the 2002 James Bond film Die Another Day[6] earned the V12 Vanquish the number three spot on the list of Best Film Cars Ever.\n\nThe car we have here for sale is a 2003 Model, finished in Black with Black trim.\n\nBeing from a period in storage the car has been little used for a number of years and currently shows just 42500 miles\n\nWith just two former recorded owners and service history with Aston Woks and Aston specialists, the car is supplied by us fully serviced and MOT tested with 12 months warranty"}

{"name": "1985 FORD CAPRI 2.8 INJECTION SPECIAL - £54,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 6430 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "FOR SALE\nA phenomenal Ford Capri 2.8 Injection Special with only 6,430 miles from new.\n\nEQUIPMENT\nRemote control driver’s door mirror, body-coloured grille and bonnet lip, lamp bezels body-coloured, power assisted steering, front and rear spoilers, anti-burst locks, tailgate wash/wipe, tinted glass all round, tilting/sliding steel sunroof, ammeter and oil pressure gauge, tachometer, quartz analogue clock, courtesy lights, perforated black headlining, front reclining Recaro seats, three-spoke leather covered steering wheel, boot light, instrument brightness control, Ford ESRT 32PS stereo cassette.  Factory options; Black paintwork.  Dealer accessories; Ford front fog lamps. \n\nEXTERIOR\nThis unbelievable Ford Capri 2.8 Injection Special is exactly that, special!  A genuine one owner example with a warranted 6,430 miles from new, this collector’s quality Capri is simply outstanding.  Finished in factory optional Black, (Code A 9), the paintwork boasts a flawless finish throughout commensurate with the obvious ultra-low mileage credentials and total dedication to preservation from its one and only owner who writes in a letter in the history file that he has never washed the car, only polished it!  The fully detailed underside portrays the days when the car attended shows, including a winning visit to Ford Fair whereby it rightly deserved its ‘Car of The Show’ prize.  All dealer branding remains fitted including number plates, rear screen sticker and even the tax disc holder still showing the original 1985 disc!  Be prepared to experience the thrill of buying the pinnacle of Ford Capri’s.\n\nINTERIOR\nIncredible.  Shielded from natural daylight in the owner’s garage and subject to just 6,430 miles usage, the interior is pristine.  The supportive Recaro seats in grey high-grade leather with ‘Strobe’ pattern fabric centre panels, (Code Q5), are spotlessly clean with firm seat structure and even have the factory labels are still attached to the runners.  The original ESRT 32PS stereo cassette and electric aerial are fully operational as is all other equipment and gauges.  The ashtray has never been used but the cover has some tiny marks.  The rear seats have never been sat in and the time warp boot area has the build label to the floor and the factory fitted Ford gas struts.  The pin straight parcel shelf is suspended by the factory Ford rubber hangers and the 1985 date stamp to the underside has survived.  Comparable to a 1985 showroom car, this interior is amazing.\n\nENGINE & TRANSMISSION\nThe Capri 2.8 Injection was the first offering of the new Special Vehicle Engineering (SVE) operation that had recently been set up in Dunton, Essex.  SVE added a Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system, an oil/water heat exchanger, viscous coupled fan and an improved radiator making the 158 BHP capable of 130mph and 0-60mph in 7.9 seconds.  The fantastic engine bay has been fastidiously detailed for the show circuit with highly polished components throughout.  The five-speed gearbox is smooth with a light clutch.\n\nWHEELS, TYRES & BRAKES\nThe factory 7-spoke alloy wheels are unmarked with correct Ford badged centre caps and factory external weights.  A collectable and highly prized full set of five Goodyear Eagle NCT VR60 tyres have remained on the car since new.  The hydraulic dual-line servo-assisted brakes with ventilated front discs unique on the 2.8 Special are shiny clean with no wear.\n\nHISTORY FILE\nBuilt in March 1985 at the Saarlouis Plant in Germany, and supplied new to Mr Alridge by Ford Main Dealer, Dinnages Garages Ltd of Haywards Heath, on the 24th December 1985.  The new vehicle invoice reveals a price paid of £10,591.59 less part exchange allowance for Mr Aldridge’s 1984 Capri 1600LS.  A letter in the history file was written by the owner just before he decided to sell after 38 years ownership whereby, he details his custodianship of the car including how he collected his Capri from the dealership when it had covered just 3.7 miles and he was aged just 21 years!  The car was driven home on that first day and parked in the garage only for the next day he woke to a foot of snow outside and the car could not be driven, very frustrating!  Within the first year the owner decided to have a stainless-steel exhaust system custom made to exactly replicate the original at a cost of £1,078!  Very soon into ownership and by his own admission, the car became an obsession and it was polished weekly, never taken out in the rain and has never even been wet-washed!  The owner exhibited ‘PYJ’ at car shows in the 1980’s and 90’s including winning at Ford Fair, the ultimate accolade.  \n\nThe full book pack including all dealership point of sale literature has been kept along with  an original 1985 Ford range brochure and separate Capri Laser/Injection Special brochure with price list.  The original service book has the one and only owner’s details entered and a folder holds documents to include MOT certificates dating back to the first in early 1989 and invoices.  Three sets of keys are supplied including the rare master key.  A major service including all oils, coolant, brake fluid and spark plugs has been carried out in October 2023 using genuine Ford parts where possible.  Look no further, you have found the ultimate one owner low mileage Capri!\n\nMOT October 2024, HPI Clear."}

The 575M was replaced by the 599 GTB in the first half of 2006. Updates from the 550 included a renewed interior, but with substantial improvements mechanically, including bigger brake discs, a larger and more powerful engine, a different weight distribution, refined aerodynamics and fluid-dynamics and an adaptive suspension set-up (the four independent suspensions are also controlled by the gearbox, to minimize pitch throughout the 200-milliseconds shift time). Two six-speed transmissions were available, a conventional manual gearbox and, for the first time on a Ferrari V12, Magneti Marelli's semi-automatic 'F1' gearbox. The model number refers to total engine displacement in litres, whilst the 'M' is an abbreviation of modificato (\"modified\").\n\nThe Ferrari Superamerica is the open variant of the Ferrari 575 M Maranello. The Ferrari 550 Maranello was also an open variant, namely the 550 Barchetta. The appearance differed little, except for one important element: the old spyder still had a conservative roof construction, namely a canvas soft top, while on the Superamericea the roof was said to be \"Revocromico\". This roof, patented by Fioravanti, is one of a kind. The principle is simple: the glass roof hinges at the C-pillar so that it lies flat at the rear of the boot when open. It is therefore not a real spyder, but rather a particular type of targa. This is not the first time that Ferrari has used the Superamerica name. In the 50s and 60s, it was the name of the extremely exclusive and fast versions of Ferrari. These did not have the 3 liter V12, but often V12s with a displacement of around 5 liters.\n\nSpecifications\nBodywork\nLength: cm (in): 455 (179.1)\nWidth: cm (in): 193 (76.2)\nHeight: cm (in): 128 (50.3)\nWheelbase: cm (in): 250 (98.4)\nWeight: kg (lb): 1690 (3726)\nMechanics.\nDisplacement:  V12 5748 cc (351 cu in), front-mounted\nValve gear: 48\nFuel system: Bosch Motronic injection\nGearbox: 6-speed, semi-automatic\nDriven wheels: rear-wheel drive\nLeft hand drive\nMaximum power: 532 hp at 7250 rpm\nMaximum torque: 589 Nm at 5250 rpm\nMaximum speed : 320 km/h (199 mph)"}

It also appears to have been well looked after before my ownership. The mileage is about 77,000 miles. There is a large folder of paperwork and service information to come with it. It has a new MoT (expires October 2024). There are 3 keys, 2 with fobs and the third a fob without electronics to allow you to open the car and retrieve the main key from the boot or whatever. \nIn my time with the car it has had: New parking sensors, replacement clutch, all belts, tensioners and water pump replaced in late 2020, replacement rear upper suspension arms, coil packs renewed, Gold resistor to sort the fan, front coil springs replaced, track rod end and drop link, bonnet gas struts replaced,\nnew number plate lamps assembly, everything works and no warning lights show. The air conditioning is fully functioning and it received a new compressor and re-gas earlier this year. The 4 tyres are Uniroyal Rainsports fitted in 2022 and 2023 respectively rear and front.

Also fitted are Vantage specification 16’’ polished ‘Ronal’ road wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport tyres, combining to improve both safety and overall performance.\n\nFirst registered in 1987 and rare to market, the Aston Martin V8 Volante equipped with electronic fuel injection (Efi), was produced toward the end of V8 production for just 3 years and delivered greater power and torque, than its predecessors. Only 216 were built before production of the V8 ceased, with the majority configured in left hand drive for export to the USA, with only 44 built in UK Right Hand Drive specification.\n\nThe attractive example we are pleased to now offer, originally supplied by HWM of Walton on Thames, remained with the first owner for some 20 years. Maintained by Aston Martin Works and Aston Martin agents, prior to a bare metal re-paint, from Black to the Royal Blue and chassis restorative works being carried out. Supplied by ourselves to its last two owners, 2016 and 2021, the car has subsequently been much cherished and lightly used by its marque enthusiast owner who’s recent V8 Vantage X-pack purchase, prompts this sale.\n\nEndowed with more power and torque than the previous generation V8 Volantes, the EFi is distinguishable in having a lower bonnet line than earlier Volante’s, allowing improved forward visibility to complement the enhanced performance.\n\nOffered inclusive of a well-documented service history file, including all MOT certificates, service invoices and photo records of the bare metal repaint and chassis works. Now with a total of 53,000 miles covered, this highly attractive V8 Volante is being offered inclusive of full preparation, 12 months MOT, 12 months warranty, along with an extensive leather-bound history file, lambswool overmats and a custom fit bespoke car cover.\n\nAvailable for viewing and demonstration now at our Hertfordshire showrooms."}

{"name": "2003 FORD FOCUS 2.0 RS 3DR - £29,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 25007 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "FOR SALE\nA striking early Ford Focus RS Mk1 build number 571 with only 25,007 miles.\n\nEQUIPMENT\nComputer optimised unitary welded steel body, rigid occupant safety cell, energy absorbing crumple zones, wider front and rear pressed steel wings, auxiliary air intakes, aerodynamic splitter and rear wing, mounted side sills, modified lower rear apron, driver and front passenger airbags, air conditioning, leather sports steering wheel with blue inserts, carbon fibre centre console with start button, limited edition number plaque, Sparco aluminium handbrake, gear knob and pedals, boost gauge and ‘change up light’, bright metal tread plates with RS script, stereo radio/6CD model 6006E, Thatcham CAT 1 alarm.  Accessories; RS front floor mats.\n\nEXTERIOR\nBuild number 0571 is an early example, finished in stunning Imperial Blue Metallic, (Code Q2), the only available colour.  The paintwork boasts a deep polished shine and uniform finish and all factory panels are pin straight.  The bumpers, side skirts and trim sections are in superb condition.  The only noteworthy imperfections are a tiny ding to the nearside B-pillar trim and some stone chips to the frontal area.  The Ford and special RS badges and Ford main dealer number plates remain fitted as do the original clear film gravel rash guards to the lower rear quarters.  This superb example is a credit to this fast Ford icon and presents as a clean, useable example.\n\nINTERIOR\nInside this white-hot Ford are a pair of body-hugging Sparco road-race seats swathed in luxurious Racing Black and Blue Leather and Black Alcantara, (Code AR).  The RS and Sparco logos are embossed and stitched into the upholstery, coupled with this are the aluminium fittings, push button start and numbered plaque.  The non-double-stitched front seats are correct for an earlier car and the interior is very clean with only very light wear to the driver’s outer bolster and some tiny marks to the dash.  The steering wheel blue leather, a known weak point has never been retrimmed and is bright and unworn.  The near impossible to source RS front carpet mats remain with the car but stored in the boot to preserve with a second set of Focus mats for usage.  The number 0571 plaque is present and the green starter button without ‘engine start’ lettering is correct for the earliest cars.  Ford built this car to truly delight its motorsport loving RS devoted fan base and the long-awaited car did not disappoint.\n\nENGINE & TRANSMISSION\nFitted with the thumping Ford 2.0 Duratec RS four-cylinder 16v unit the power output achieved is 212bhp at 5500rpm and 310Nm torque at 3500rpm.  The maximum speed is 144mph while 0-60 is dispatched in just 6.4 seconds!  The engine bay is clean with factory plates, stickers and labels visible.  Correct for an earlier build car is the black throttle cable ‘trumpet’ grommet with blue collar.  The sturdy Ford MTX-75 gearbox offers the ultimate rally road car experience.\n\nWHEELS, TYRES & BRAKES\nThe unique 8 x 18in Oz Racing refurbished rims are unmarked with perfect RS centre caps.  Michelin Pilot Sport 225/40 ZR18 tyres are fitted all-round with excellent tread.  In lew of the spare wheel is the factory supplied compressor and unopened tyre sealant.  Pristine Brembo 4-pot callipers are visible through the large spoke apertures and 324mm ventilated front and 280mm rear discs provide immense stopping power.\n\nHISTORY FILE\nFactory build records confirm that number 0571 rolled of the production line on the 27th November 2002 ready to be dispatched the supplying Main Dealer, CD Brammall Ford in Milton Keynes.  Date of first registration was the 23rd January 2003 and the car has now covered just 25,007 miles from new with only three owners.  Huge demand meant long waiting lists, even pre-launch, and so eager customers were prepared to pay well over odds to acquire one of these limited production cars.  The previous owner purchased 0571 in 2016 for a record price at the time having always regretted selling the example he purchased brand new in 2003 following the first successful spell at his fledgling business.  A true blue-oval enthusiast, the car formed part of his collection alongside a Mk2 Escort RS2000 and Mk1 Cortina.\n\nThe comprehensive history file contains all original handbooks, guides and special RS supplement which are contained within the Ford leather RS wallet.  There are 15 recorded services evidenced in the stamped service book and accompanying invoices in the huge history file.  All servicing has been carried out by Ford Main Dealers or specialists and the most recent service was in September 2023 at 24,925 miles.  Three keys are present along with both RS alarm fobs and a RS cherished registration number has remained on since new.\n\nPure blue-oval brilliance and firmly a modern classic.\n\nMOT August 2024, HPI Clear."}

It’s wonderful, wonderful, wonderful” said no other than Jeremy Clarkson, when summarising the original V12 Vantage model, in one of the most emotive motoring videos ever produced, for Top Gear, shortly after the model’s launch, in 2009.\n\nOver the next 9 years, the V12 Vantage went on to be one of the most successful and respected Aston Martin models, appealing to existing customers of the marque and to a new and enthusiastic audience. Following various improvements and model year specification changes, production of the V12 Vantage ceased in 2018, by which time the S specification model was introduced (in 2013) with the 565 bhp engine, mated to either a Sportshift III or 7-speed manual gearbox.\n\nIt is one of those ‘last of the line’ 2017 model year, 7-speed manual V12 Vantage S that we are delighted to offer. One of just 114 right-hand drive 7-speed manuals and one of just 6 finished in this exterior paint colour and the only example built in this interior / exterior colour combination, making it a ‘one of one’!\n\nFinished in Mariana Blue over Lords Red hides, with Cream Truffle contrasting stitching and Black cherry carpets. The livery is completed by Q special Jet Black painted roof panel and Jet Black painted tailgate graphic (including tail lamp infills). Overall, a classic, distinguished specification.\n\nIn addition to the usual high specifications of this model, notable optional extras chosen by the original purchaser, a serial Aston Martin owner and client of Nicholas Mee & Co for many years, include: Aston Martin 700w Premium Audio, Black hood meshes, Dark anodised brake calipers, bright tailpipe finishers, piano black fascia and Piano Black interior trim pack, front grille carbon, Sports seats, bright side strakes, 19” 10 spoke Liquid Silver wheels and bright side window finishers. Laterly, a set of iconic ‘Union Jack’ Aston Martin wings have been fitted, the originals being available if not to the taste of the next owner.\n\nSold by ourselves to it’s second owner in 2019, the car has been much cherished by its two owners and maintained, to schedule, by either Aston Martin Works or ourselves, the last service having been completed in March 2023. Our pre-sales inspection confirms that the car is in excellent condition throughout with only the lightest evidence of use.\n\nSupplied with our usual high standards of pre-delivery preparation, 12 months warranty and with a complete history file, containing original Sale invoice, Build Record, MOT certificates and service invoices, Owners manual, custom fit bespoke car cover and battery conditioner.\n\nAvailable for viewing and demonstration at our Hertfordshire showrooms."}

The back of the car is completely occupied by the engine which is sitting in front of the rear wheels, making the Clio V6 a mid engined Super Hatchback.\n\n\n\nThe 2002 Renault Clio V6 Phase 1 shares very few parts with its city-car counterpart, due to the size and location of the engine most of the structure had to be modified to handle the power and the weight of the 3.0 V6 ES9 engine. Strengthened chassis, beefed up suspensions and brakes, 6 Speed gearbox and wide tyres were fitted to the Clio V6 in order to handle like a sports car but be as usable as a city car.\n\n\n\nThe Renault Clio V6 is not for the faint of heart, the short wheel base, combined with the incredible amount of torque and the questionable weight balance, make it for an incredible experience to drive, challenging your skills and your reactions. It is just incredible how such a small car can be turned into a proper sports car.\n\n\n\nThe 2002 Renault Clio V6 Phase 1 is quite a remarkable car, at idle the engine is extremely smooth and quiet, at normal speeds you would barely tell you have 230hp ready to be unleashed at any given time. Being a car from the good old era of Naturally Aspirated engines, the torque is always available at all revs, and the little Clio is always ready to go, & almost feels like it wants you to push it to the limit. The torque curve starts right at the bottom and doesn’t stop until 7300rpms, singing beautifully all the way trough, almost like having your personal French Opera singer sitting behind you and keeping you company on all your drives.\n\n\n\nThis 2002 Renault Clio V6 is presented in beautiful Iceberg Silver, had new tyres in 2018, has always been garaged and cherished by the owner, whose had it for over a decade, and has only covered a scant 20k miles since new.\n\n\n\nThis 2002 Renault Clio V6 Phase 1 is ready to be seen and driven away from our showroom in Northampton.\nCall Richard Biddulph.

The car has green badges.\n\n\n\nThe body style is unique to Bentley and it being the last of the pre-separation (RR&B) models adds to the interest.\n\n\n\nCost and details (based on the specification sheets, and original invoice). \n\nThe car was ordered in 1998, and supplied on 3/9/1998 to the dealers Burton House. Sheffield.  It was first registered 4/12/1998. The basic cost at the time for a Continental R was £170000 excluding VAT; including delivery and VAT it came to £199926. This car also has a Mulliner Park Ward (“MPW”) special package costing £19459 inclusive of VAT, to bring the total cost up to £219385, which makes it one of the most expensive Bentleys produced.\n\nThe MPW package includes Birdseye Maple Stained Grey woodwork and waist rails, black chrome to all interior brightwork finishings, and Continental T style seat trim in “Dyed Through” black leather.  There are Chatsworth logos to all four waist rails, and embroidered onto the top section of all four seat squabs. The interior trim in general is most distinctive and unlike that of other Bentley Continentals. It has Continental T 18” five spoke wheels with 255/50 tyres.\n\n\n\nThe previous owner had fitted a Kenwood Electronics touch screen system, incorporating a 7” motorised fold away monitor, tuner, DVD/CD receiver, USB and iPhone interface, Bluetooth for hands free telephone, and rear view camera video.  It was installed in October 2008 at a cost of £2465. The car still also has the original Motorola telephone in working order fitted in the armrest locker.\n\n\n\n2.  Provenance and servicing\n\n\n\nThe car has had three previous owners with the current V5 being that of a lady.\n\n\n\nSupplied through Burton House, Sheffield who carried out the initial 1000 mile service. The first owner, Mr Vince Smith of Macclesfield, kept the car for just over 5 years from December 1998 to April 2004.  It was serviced by Bentley main dealers Michael Powles, Leicester.  30/8/2000 schedule 1 service at 5523 miles, 5/4/2001 schedule C 7654 miles, 21/6/2002 schedule 2 9569 miles, 23/12/2003 schedule C 13868 miles.\n\n\n\nMichael Powles, Leicester sold the car to its second owner David Wright of The New House, Gonalston, Nottingham, NG14 7JA, on 26/4/2004.

The 1602, which was originally introduced as the 1600-2, was built in Coupe, Cabriolet, and Touring body styles. \n\nThese cars were powered by the same 1.6L inline four engine from the New Class 1600 and featured a 4 speed manual transmission that sent drive to the rear wheels. \n\nThe car is finished in Black with cream trim and black carpets, this rare example of the 1602 has only done 3000 miles from new and is in original condition, (bar a little paint work), as if it had just rolled out of the factory!!

All work was undertaken by a well known VW specialist.\n\nIn Japan a new headlining was fitted and there is evidence of main dealer servicing present. We have the de-reg Export certificate along with inspection translation.\n\nAs with our previous Lupo GTI's it is a delight to drive with plenty of power throughout the rev range and tight nimble handling. The condition is of course outstanding throughout.\n\nSpecification includes air-con, PAS, ABS, electric windows & mirrors, front & side airbags, rear wash wipe, xenon headlights, sports seats.\n\nFor those who don't know the Lupo GTI weighs in at well under 1000 kgs and the twin cam 1600 engine produces 123 bhp and is put to the tarmac through a close ratio 6 speed gearbox. \n\nPerhaps VW should have called the Lupo GTI the 'Lupo GTI-R' or similar as it is so far removed from the standard car. \nBack in the early 2000's a VW GTI was generally just another larger engine from elsewhere in the VAG group being placed into a smaller car and stiffer suspension being added. With the Lupo GTI a much more serious approach was taken with the base car being extensively altered through use of wider tracks, re-location of the battery to the boot, thinner glass being fitted but most interestingly of all the bonnet, doors and front wings were all aluminium. Taking the bespoke running gear and these differences into account the Lupo GTI is as different to the base car as the BMW E30 M3 was from the 318i.\n\nIt is my view that these cars are still under valued in the marketplace and currently offer an excellent long term ownership prospect.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to get in touch with your interest."}

It’s here and now!\n\nThe Ferrari Testarossa (Type F110) went into production in 1984 as the successor to the Berlinetta Boxer. The Pininfarina-designed car was originally produced from 1984 to 1991, with two model revisions following the ending of Testarossa production and the introduction of the 512 TR and F512 M which were produced from 1992 to 1996. Almost 10,000 Testarossas, 512 TRs, and F512 Ms were produced, making it one of the most-produced Ferrari models, despite its high price and exotic design.\n\nThe Testarossa premiered at the 1984 Paris Auto Show. All versions of the Testarossa had the power fed through the wheels from a rear-mounted, five-speed manual transmission. The rear mid-engine (between the axles but behind the cabin) keeps the centre of gravity in the middle of the car, which increases stability and improves the car's cornering ability, and thus results in a standing weight distribution of 40/60. The original Testarossa was re-engineered for 1992 and released as the 512 TR, and the F512 M at the 1994 Paris Auto Show. The car dropped the TR initials and added the M which in Italian stood for modificata, and the final version of the Testarossa.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBodywork\n\nLength: cm (in): 448 (176.6)\nWidth: cm (in): 198 (77.8)\nHeight: cm (in): 113 (44.5)\nWheelbase: cm (in): 255 (100.4)\nWeight: kg (lb): 1506 (3320)\nMechanics.\n\nDisplacement: flat V12 4942 cc (302 cu in), mid-mounted\nValve gear: 48\nFuel system: Bosch K-Tronic injection\nGearbox: 5-speed manual\nDriven wheels: rear-wheel drive\nMaximum power: 385 bhpat 6300 rpm\nMaximum torque: 490 Nm at 4500 rpm\nMaximum speed: 275 km/h (171 mph) "}

{"name": "1980 LAND ROVER SERIES 3 109 DIESEL - €17,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The Land Rover is undoubtedly one of the longest lasting vehicle series ever. It was taken in production in 1948, and the initial plan was to keep it selling for no longer than three years. The sales went so great that it kept going, and Rover Group, the parent company, decided to turn it into a brand itself that is still widely present in the automotive industry to this day.\n\nThe first Land Rover was unveiled at the Amsterdam Motor Show in 1948 and was designed by Maurice Wilks, who had already been the chief designer at Rover. He took inspiration from the design of the Jeep and used the box-section Jeep chassis as a basis for designing the Land Rover. The result was no less Spartan than it might initially appear, and the interior was far from comfortable. It was clear that this vehicle would fit in rural areas and for industrial use. Nevertheless, the Land Rover kept selling very well, year after year, and decade after decade, it has been upgraded and offered to a wider audience. Nowadays, ‘Land Rover’ has become almost a buzzword.\n\nThe first Land Rovers were built in three generations, which were later subdivided into a series with Roman numerals. In 1983, the ‘Defender’ was introduced as being the successor. It was partially hand-built for decades and gave the Land Rover brand an immense boost.\n\nLand Rover Series III\n\nThe Series III is the third variant of the Land Rover, which was only later given a series name. It was built from 1971 to 1985 and was then succeeded by the famous Defender.\n\nThe Series III comes with a range of different engines that may have low horsepower but produce a high amount of torque at low RPM, which is unique to these vehicles. There are straight-four and straight-six petrol engines and a four-cylinder diesel engine.\n\nA Land Rover, any Land Rover, is indestructible. They are sturdy and tough, even indestructible. They can be used for daily driving, for road trips, or simply as a unique vintage car."}

{"name": "1983 PORSCHE 911 3.2 CARRERA TARGA - €89,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 229369 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Fully-restored - thus mint condition – engine ready to roll thousands of carefree kilometres/miles\nWith Porsche’s certificate of authenticity\nInitially delivered new in 1984 in Italy\nEdition MY 1985\nPaint job done in sporty and flashy red\nThe Porsche 911 is the exception that proves the rule “to all good things comes an end”. This contemporary and luxurious, yet sporty, German sportscar was released in 1963. To this day, they are still being produced in large numbers, also a range of variants has been developed to mimic a tailor-made product range. Although the 911 has been refined over the decades, the basic design – which is recognisable and thus sublime – has generally remained unchanged. This pragmatic and contemporary approach only Porsche could ever succeed in.\n\nThe 911 is the successor to the Porsche 356 and was designed by Ferdinand Porsche - the grandson of Porsche’s founder – and presented at the Frankfurt Auto Show in the autumn of 1963. In 1964, the first models were delivered to customers, and due to its great success, the 911 was soon expanded: a cheaper 912, a faster 911S and the rollbar equipped and extremely safe convertible Targa were released. This Targa was named after a Sicilian race that was year by year won by Porsche.\n\nInitially, this car would be called the Porsche 901, but Peugeot became the headwind as their models were named by a three-digit number with a 0 in the middle. “Don’t worry”, said Porsche and they replaced the 0 with a 1. The Porsche 911 was born! After that, there was still Porsche cars built that were named with a three-digit number with a 0 in the middle, however those were exclusively intended for racing and circuit purposes, not for public roads.\n\nUndoubtedly, the 911 has been modified over the years; as durable a design may be, times change, and cars do too. Porsche has always been prepared for changes and innovation. They gradually increased the engine displacement, the power and the size. The biggest mechanical change was the transition from air cooled engines to water cooled engine. Water cooled engines ensure an evenly cooled engine, which results in uniform combustion. This results in lower consumption and less emission.\n\nPorsche 911 3.2 Carrera\n\nAfter a five-year production run of the 'Super Carrera', which was initially touted as 'the final 911 ever,' Porsche decided not to stop the production of this timeless sports car. Neither the 928, nor the 924, nor the 944 could shake the foundations of the 911, and people remained enamoured with the 911, which continues to work splendidly to this day.\n\nStarting from 1984, Porsche began building a successor to what was initially thought to be the last 911 ever. They opted, as usual, for a flat-six engine, albeit now it got slightly bigger: from 3.0 litres to 3.2 litres, aimed at making more power. Consequently, new brakes were introduced to rein in the engine's full potential, the engine received a higher compression ratio, and it wasn't until 1987 that the car provided an updated transmission.\n\nThe 3.2 Carrera was available in coupe, targa, and cabriolet variants. Approximately 35,000 of the coupe were sold, along with 18,000 targas, and the cabriolet rounded off the total with 20,000 sold.\n\nIn 1989, the 911 underwent a significant overhaul and modernization. The 3.2 Carrera represents the final 911 with the aura of a true classic, though, of course, that is subject to the prevailing trends of the times.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 429 (169 inch)\nWidth (cm): 165 (65 inch)\nHeight (cm): 132 (52 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 227 (89 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1210 (2668 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 3164 cc flat-six rear-engine\nValve gear: 12\nFuel system: MPI\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 228 hp (170 kW) at 5900 t/m\ntorque: 284 Nm at 4800 t/m\nTop speed: 245 km/h (152 mph)"}

The Porsche was supplied new by Monarch Porsche in Warwick and they serviced the car at 2734 and 12843 miles in 1990. Stattons of Wilmslow serviced the car at 21854 before two stamps from a Cheshire based Porsche specialist at 20729 in 1992, and 31620 in 1993. AFN Porsche dealership took over maintenance in 1994, stamping the book at 36676 and again the following year at 41567 miles.\nIn 1997 Merlin Porsche of Nottingham began maintaining the car and in three years serviced the 911 at 48116, 52326, 55478, 56405 and 61522 miles. Porsche Strasse in Leeds serviced the car at 65690, a Porsche specialist serviced at 73496 miles and since then Revolution Porsche specialists have looked after the car for its last owner. Revolution have stamped the book at 76000, 76621, 77374 and 77633 miles.\n\nThe Porsche comes with a comprehensive invoice file to accompany the original service book. Thousands of pounds worth of invoices are on file, but between 2018 and 2020 over £12,000 alone was spent with Revolution Porsche in Leeds. In 2020, they carried out a complete engine rebuild with the invoice including parts and labour totalling over £9,000. Since the rebuild, the car has covered less than 1000 miles. Other expenditure within the last 1000 miles includes a new clutch, Bosch starter motor, front engine timing covers, new fuel line, new Continental tyres, new power steering pipe, new rear brake pads and pad wear indicators and new battery.\n\nDuring late 2022, a cosmetic program of work costing over £20,000 has taken place. The 911 was stripped down, bumpers off and then any areas of corrosion were professionally removed. The outer shell was then prepared for a full re-paint that has been carried out to an exceptional standard. The original, correct alloy wheels were re-furbished and the car then carefully built up resulting in a first class overall finish. Brand new rear lights were purchased and fitted, new bumper brackets, rubbers seals, heat shileds and various other parts fitted as required.\n\nThis car is now an incredible package, its beautifully finished and presenting in exceptional condition with a top quality bodyshell and paint finish. The original interior is beautifully presented and well kept, and on the road this 911 is impressive with its strong, fit, recently rebuilt engine, smooth manual transmission and in typical 911 fashion offers impressive handling and road holding. With impressive history, paperwork and its current condition, this is a very sought after, standard specification car that will only continue to increase in desirability."}

The R1200C has a strong following, its very much a cruiser, and was an attempt to tap into the American style cruiser market. The iconic and very collectable model was also first released with an advance promotional placement of the motorcycle on the James Bond movie ‘Tomorrow Never Dies’. The R1200C was also one of four BMW motorcycles in the Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City in 1998.\nOur bike has covered less than 1000 miles in the last six years and was stored unused from 2018 to 2022. In April 2022 the last owner had the BMW serviced, replaced the master cylinder, replaced the alternator belt and had the bike checked over and MOT tested at a cost of £655. Since then the BMW has covered just a few miles, more forming part of a collection that getting road use.\n\nThis UK supplied R1200C was first registered on the 8th June 1999 and comes with the rather fitting R12 number plate. The bike comes with a file of previous MOT certificates and various invoices. R12 OOK runs lovely and is on the button, and presents well as a nicely aged, honest and original example."}

The model was only available in three bespoke colour combinations, 60 of each colour and Misano Red being one of them. This iconic BMW was produced in the last year of the model’s 13 year production run and was more desirable due to the interior, exterior and mechanical improvements made to the model throughout its product life span.\nOur Motorsport Edition has recently come to us in part exchange and has covered a mere 76300 miles from new. The exceptional service history, supported by its original stamped service booklet has no less than 24 dealer stamps. In addition, a complete handbook pack is present along with its original spare keys, various service invoices and a complete set of old MOT certificates dating back to its first test in 1992.\n\nCentral BMW Birmingham supplied the Motorsport Edition on 1st August 1989 and carried out its first service at 5502 miles. Various BMW franchise dealers and more latterly, BMW specialists completed the vast service history thereafter as outlined in the service booklet. The last oil inspection was carried out on 1st December 2021 at 76210 miles.\n\nOn file there are three original ‘Bill of Sale' documents, the oldest at 18200 miles in August 1992 when the Motorsport Edition was sold by Mole Valley Motor Group in Chessington, Surrey to a Mr Bush for £23250.

The vehicle only having travelled some 4000 miles during this 7 year period. The vehicle was then sold to its last long term owner.\n\nThe condition simply speaks for itself. The Misano Red paintwork is excellent, a fantastic straight body shell with excellent clean panels, a beautiful preserved leather interior and a nicely detailed engine bay. The ‘M' split rim alloy wheels are in exceptional condition. The original complete tool kit is in excellent condition as is the original first aid kit still in its original packaging! This beautiful example drives as good as she looks with a strong powerful engine giving excellent oil pressure. The automatic gearbox is simply devine!\n\nG101MUJ is a beautifully correct, detailed, original vehicle that has never had the opportunity to deteriorate. The impeccable service history reiterates the way each owner has taken full responsibility for its preservation, in a way that they have seen themselves purely as a custodian of this fantastic rare motor vehicle.\n\nIn short, this impeccable Motorsport Edition would be an excellent addition to any classic car collector or BMW enthusiasts collection."}

According to the Service Book, it was serviced by Mercedes Benz in Manheim in June 1984 and was then taken to the USA by Mr Biebel at some point later that year. The car remained in the USA and had two more keepers in Santa Barbara California before it was exported to the UK in July 2010 and it was registered here on 25th May 2012.

{"name": "1990 BMW Z1 CONVERTIBLE - £49,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 59963 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "When the BMW Z1 was first shown to the public, the company had absolutely no intention of actually putting it into production and BMW had generally shied away from two seater roadsters since the V8 engined 507 – a very beautiful commercial failure for BMW.   The Z1 was an instant hit with the public when images of sharp looking two-seater were leaked to the world's press, but if BMW had had stuck to its initial plan, the roadster would never have gone beyond the planning stages. Its unusual appearance and clever doors stem from the fact it was simply acting as development mule for the E36 3-Series’ clever new Z-axle.  After such a great reception for the concept, it became clear that there might actually be a market for such a creation, and BMW quickly moved to launch a limited edition run of the Z1 In 1987. Characterful and quirky are not words usually associated with BMWs, but the Z1 has both attributes in spades while also retaining BMW's great reputation for performance and speed. Take one look at this slightly odd-looking two-seater, and you can instantly see that the designers had a lot of fun putting it together, and that sense of enjoyment translated brilliantly to the driving experience. Every one was left-hand drive, although official UK cars came with a speedometer in miles per hour and a fuel gauge in gallons rather than litres plus a large amount of the mechanicals were borrowed from the E30 too, although a completely bespoke chassis and bodyshell caused the price of the Z1 to soar – pushing this 170bhp two-seater to around the same as a basic Porsche 911!   In total, 8,000 Z1's were produced between October 1988 and June 1991 with many of those still on the roads today. This lovely Z1 - Chassis No: 1469 was supplied new by BMW dealer Sundridge Park in Bromley, Kent and first registered on 19th January 1990. It is finished in BMW Dream Black Metallic, which appears dark Green in certain light conditions and has Dark Green Leather upholstery and Green carpets, Black Mohair Soft Top (replaced in 2015), Three Spoke Steering Wheel, Electric Windows and Doors, Electric Door Mirrors, standard Heating, Sony Stereo/single CD player with Bluetooth, Wind Deflector, BMW Fitted Alarm/Immobiliser, 2494cc Straight Six Engine, 5 Speed Manual Gearbox, Power Assisted Steering, Front and Rear Disc Brakes, and unique 16'' seven spoke Alloy Wheels with relatively new Nexen 225/45/16 tyres. It has only had 3 former keepers from new with the current owner having bought the car in December 1995 - 28 years this December, and it has now covered 59,963 miles from new with a full and comprehensive service history with 22 stamps in the Service Book from both BMW main dealers and BMW specialists and it has also had 2 cam belt changes during its life. The speedometer was replaced in February 2015 by BMW specialist BMS Surrey @ 58,505 miles and it has only covered a further 1,458 miles in the last 8 years and 59,963 miles in total and a copy of their invoice for this is shown in the documents section of this advert. The car was last serviced and MOT'd by BMS Surrey in December 2022 and it has been driven 124 miles since then. It comes with its original BMW wallet with all books and manuals, all MOT certificates from 1995 to date, a huge file of invoices, ownership history including V5 registration documents, an indoor car cover and an all-weather car cover, all tools and jacks, space saver spare wheel with cover, battery conditioner and the original speedometer and circuit board replaced in 2015. This car is in excellent condition throughout with really nice paintwork, reconnolised leather seats and of course they do not rust as they have a fully galvanised chassis and plastic body panels. There are some scuffs to the alloy wheel rims on a couple of the wheels, but other than this, the car is hard to fault. These are very rare cars and prices have increased quite dramatically over the last 20 years and should continue to appreciate in value. Upon sale the car will receive a pre-sales service and new MOT and it will come with our own 6 Month Mechanical Warranty which can be upgraded and extended at additional cost if required.

{"name": "1980 AUSTIN MORRIS MINI PICK-UP 95 (1000) - £16,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 1197 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Austin Morris Mini Pick-Up was produced from 1961-1983 and it was based on the original Mini Van. There were a number of different models produced during this period with either the 848cc or 998cc engine and some were badged as either Austin or Morris under during the British Motor Corporation (BMC) name, and under both British Leyland and Austin Rover they were just called Mini Pick-Up's.  In December 1978 under Austin Rover ownership, the car was Re-branded as 'Mini 95' indicating the 0.94-ton gross vehicle weight (rather than payload) and the car was either called the Mini Pick-Up 95 (848) or Mini Pick-Up 95 (1000).  This model was built on was built on the longer Mini Van platform of 11 feet (3.4m) with an 'open-top' rear cargo area and a tailgate. The factory specified the weight of the pick-up as less than 1,500 lbs (680 kg) with a full 6 gallon tank of fuel. As with the van, the pick-up had stamped metal slots for airflow into the engine compartment and was pretty basic, although the factory brochure described it as 'fully equipped', having a heater, passenger-side sun visor, seat belts and a laminated windscreen. A total of 58,179 Mini pick-up models were built before production finished in January 1983 and it was a great utility vehicle used by many shops and businesses, so it was a very sad day for some! This utterly unique Mini Pick-Up 95 (1000) was first registered on 1st November 1980 and was the subject of an extensive 8 year rebuild by the previous owner who was an ex-Rover Engineer. The car is finished in Two-tone Metallic Royal Blue and Silver with Blue and Grey vinyl upholstery, Walnut veneer trim, custom instruments and controls, period Philips radio/cassette player and a mahogany coloured load bed. It has a rebuilt and uprated 998cc Engine with twin SU Carburettors, 4 Speed Manual Gearbox, custom twin-exit exhaust pipes and a set of 13” Mini-Lite alloy wheels with new Yokohama tyres. In reality, far too much work has gone into this striking creation to list here, but the previous owner has clearly spent an incredible amount of time, money and effort rebuilding this handsome Pick-Up. Although it is wearing some Wood & Pickett badges, it is not a W & P conversion. The car has Historic Vehicle Status, so it is also Road Tax Free, MOT exempt and ULEZ exempt and it can be insured very cheaply with an agreed value Classic Car Insurance policy - see our 'Links' page https://www.classic-chrome.net/useful-links for a list of Classic Car Insurance brokers.

{"name": "1967 JAGUAR E-TYPE S1½ 4.2 ROADSTER - £125,000 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 82825 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This beautifully restored Jaguar 'E' Type Series 1½ 4.2 Roadster - Chassis No: 1E1738 and Engine No: 7E4424-9 is an original UK RHD car and was supplied new by HR Owen in London and first registered on 6th July 1967 with its current number plate PLE 559E. Unfortunately, very little is known of the first 20 years of its life, but we do know from our HPi check that the colour was changed to Red in 1979 and it had 4 owners until it was purchased in January 1989 by the next owner from Horley in Surrey from Midland Sporting & Classic Cars Ltd in Burton on Trent for £29,750.  He subsequently had the car inspected by Jaguar specialist A J Turner of Redhill who identified a number of issues with the car and it was sent to Reliance Motors in Wolverhampton for works which included: a new boot floor, new heel board, chassis rails, complete new floor panels, repairs to sills, a complete repaint of the car plus a number of other new parts fitted including new suspension components, drive shaft UJ's, Brake & Clutch hydraulics, a new Clutch and when the car was MOT'd on completion, the mileage reading was 79,868 miles. Over the following 10 years the car was hardly used and spent most of this time in storage until the car was given by the owner to Barclay Classics in Swansea in June 2001 for further restoration and recommissioning, including a full engine rebuild, and there is a detailed invoice and time sheet in the file showing they spent 334 hours on the car and including parts, the total invoice was £9,725.52. In addition to this, the owner purchased many parts himself for Barclay Classics and there are a huge number of invoices from SC Parts and XK Engineering totalling £4,194 and therefore the total cost was just shy of £14,000. Upon completion of all works in July 2001, the car had 80,579 recorded on the MOT test on 31st July 2002 and therefore, less than 1,000 miles were covered since he bought the car in 1989! In December 2002 the car was auctioned by Bonhams in Olympia, London and was purchased by the 6th owner who lived in London for £27,000 with 80,800 miles on the clock! He kept the car for 6 years and spent a further £7,695 on the car with new parts including carpets, interior trim, new light units, Headlamp Glass, an original E-Type tool kit from the USA ($725), Brake Calipers, Alternator and all new dash switches + some chrome trims. We sold the car for him in October 2008 to the current owner with 81,785 miles recorded on the speedometer, so he also only drove the car for 1,000 miles during his ownership. The current and 7th owner of almost 15 years has also kept the car in top condition and he has used specialist dealer Enginuity in Acton, London, W3 to maintain the car for him during his ownership, and he has spent just under £10,000 with them on routine maintenance and new parts as and when required and he also has only driven 1,040 miles in the car in his ownership. This car is in excellent condition throughout and lovely to drive and it is a very reluctant sale due to the owner moving to Portugal. It has now covered a believed genuine 82,825 miles from new, but only 2,246 miles since the engine was rebuilt. It comes with an extensive history file including a huge number of invoices for all works and parts purchased, MOT certificates from 2001, Tax Discs, original Jaguar E Type handbook, workshop manual and parts lists, several Jaguar E-Type sales brochures and a Heritage Certificate.  A great investment for its next owner! Upon sale the car will receive a pre-sales service and new MOT and it will come with our own 6 Month Mechanical Warranty which can be upgraded and extended at additional cost if required.

It was one of two cars which we bought to convert to 'Electric Power' and this example has the power upgrade of an AC20 96v 65 BHP Electric Motor and 4 Tesla Batteries (22Kwh) giving improved performance (limited for safety) and improved range.  We also carried out a front Disc Brake conversion, fitted a new Front Independent Suspension Kit with adjustable shock absorbers and an uprated rear Coil Suspension + many more parts during the conversion. When we sold the car to the current owner in London in June 2018 it had covered 47,107 Kilometers and in his 5 years of ownership he has covered just over 3,700 Kilometers, mostly around London including his commute from Greenwich to the City of London and to Hastings and back on a number of occasions. It is finished in a beautiful Light Blue which is a Fiat colour from the period and has a Red and Beige vinyl interior with Red carpets and the owner has fitted a very nice red leather steering wheel. It has a Battery level gauge + an electric heater with the remainder of the instruments being original.

{"name": "1957 AUSTIN HEALEY 100/6 BN4 - £54,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 3036 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Austin-Healey 100/6 (BN4) went into production in August 1956 and was a replacement for the Austin-Healey 100/4 (BN1 & 2). It was followed by a BN6 variant in March 1958 which was a 2-seat roadster. The Austin-Healey 3000 (BN7) was introduced in 1959 and together the three models became known as the 'Big Healey's'. The 100/6 BN4 featured a 2'' longer wheelbase than the 100/4, a more powerful 2639cc straight-six engine and included a pair of small occasional seats in the rear. It had a smaller but wider radiator grille, an air scoop on the bonnet and the windscreen was now fixed. The cars used a tuned version of the BMC C-Series engine previously fitted to the Austin Westminster, initially producing 102 bhp (76 kW) and increased in 1957 to 117 bhp (87 kW) by fitting a revised manifold and cylinder head. The previously standard Overdrive unit was made optional. In December 1957 production was transferred from Longbridge to the MG plant in Abingdon and 14,436 100/6's were produced before production ended in 1959 when it was replaced with the Austin Healey 3000 MK1 (BN7). A 117 bhp (87 kW) BN6 was tested by The Motor magazine in 1959 and it recorded a top speed of 103.9 mph and could accelerate from 0-60 mph in 10.7 seconds. Overall fuel consumption of 20.8 miles per gallon was recorded. The test car cost £1,307 including taxes of £436. According to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust Certificate, this original RHD Austin Healey 100/6 (BN4) Four Seater - Chassis No: BN4-0/38340 and Engine No: 1C/H38340 was built in Longbridge, Birmingham on 10th April 1957 and was finished in Ivory White over Black with a Black vinyl interior piped in White, Black carpets, a Black Vinyl Soft Top and Side Screens, stove enamelled Wire Wheels, Overdrive, Laminated Windscreen and less Heater (although it has now had a Heater fitted) and it was delivered to BMC Distributor The Bromley Motor Works in Kent. It was then sold by BMC dealer Johnson and Brown in Bromley to its first owners - Goodhale Engineers Ltd in London, SE23 and first registered on 17th May 1957 with the number plate 6 AKM. History: The car remained in Goodhale Engineers ownership until February 1976 when it was bought by a Mr N Mallinson from Tadcaster in Yorkshire. He only drove the car for a couple of years before storing it in a garage where it remained untouched for 10 years before being purchased by the third owner a Mr Charles Pettingell from Collingham in Yorkshire on 5th October 1988 and there are hand written notes in the file regarding this. Mr Pettingell subsequently embarked on a total restoration of the car in 1989 which included many new body panels and associated parts - all supplied by Austin Healey Spares. We do not know why, but it seems that a replacement Engine - No: 29DRU202 was obtained and rebuilt along with its gearbox by the Northern TR Centre in Cleveland in February 1989. There is a large photo album of this restoration along with a huge number of invoices for all parts replaced and for works carried out in the history file. Mr Pettingell, who was an Austin Healey Owners Club member enjoyed the car for the next 10 years before selling it to a Mr David Fox from Otley in Yorkshire on 2nd August 1999. He did however retain the original number plate 6 AKM and it was issued with its current plate MFO 196 by the DVLA in December 1995. Mr Fox kept the car for 8 years and there are lots of invoices in the file for servicing and a few repairs during his ownership and also a correct an original 2639cc Engine - 1C-H/42842 from 1957 was installed including a Denis Welch Motorsport Fast Road Aluminium Cylinder Head. He sold the car to an Italian - Mr Giacomo Spallasso in September 2007 and it was subsequently registered in Cabella Ligure, Italy on 21st September 2007 and was also registered with the Automotoclub Storico Italiano in 2007 with a Certificate in the file. Mr Spallasso carried out lots of additional restoration works on the car including a complete rebuilt of the engine with a new set of SU Carburettors and a full repaint of the car - now in Colorado Red over Black - and there are lots of invoices for parts and photographs in the file. After 6 years of ownership, It was sold to a Monaco resident - Mr Franco Dapino on 15th October 2013 and he registered the car in Monaco. He barely used the car during his ownership and it spent most of its time in his garage in Monaco or in storage at a friends garage near Milan. Because it is was a Right Hand Drive car and still registered with the DVLA, he thought it would be much easier to sell the car in the UK, so he came to visit us earlier last year to ask if we would be interested in buying the car from him which we did, and we shipped it back to England and re-registered the car in our name with its number plate MFO 196.   During our re-commissioning and preparation of the car last summer, we unfortunately discovered that the head gasket had blown and the oil pressure was reading very low, so although it had a complete engine rebuild in Italy with only 3,000 miles driven since then, it was obvious that something was wrong with the engine and an investigation by specialist Crown Classic Cars in St Margarets confirmed the worst. After removing the Dennis Welch aluminium cylinder head it was clear that the gasket was not fitted correctly and the engine had been assembled incorrectly with the pistons fitted the wrong way around in the cylinders!  They have now just finished a total rebuild of the engine, fitted a new Clutch and clutch hydraulics, given the car a full brake overhaul and fitted many new ancillaries as can be seen on their invoice and list of parts shown in the documents below. The total cost to us for the rebuild and associated works came to £13,640.05 with £6,664.21 spent on parts alone! The engine is now really smooth, but it will need to be run in for 500 miles and have the cylinder head re-torqued down before it can be driven in haste, but we will organise for this to be carried out with the new owner. This really is a lovely example which looks and drives beautifully. It unfortunately owes us a lot more than we were expecting, but whoever does buy the car can be assured that they will not have to worry about the mechanics of the car! Upon sale, the car will come with a new MOT and our own standard 6 months Mechanical Breakdown Parts & Labour Warranty. This car is of course Road Tax Free, MOT exempt, ULEZ compliant and it is also eligible for the Mille Miglia! Car on display at our showrooms in Mortlake, SW London.

{"name": "1977 FERRARI 308 GT4 DINO - £59,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 85527 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "JUST ARRIVED The Dino 308 GT4 is a mid-engined V8 2+2 car built by Ferrari and was launched at the Paris Motor show in November 1973 and all cars were initially badged 'Dino' until finally gaining the Ferrari ''Prancing Horse'' badge in May 1976.  According to Ferrari's description of this car on their website: ''The Dino 308 GT4 is certainly like no other Ferrari. The new car marked several 'firsts' for Maranello, and was the first production road car with a V8 engine and the first mid-engined 4-seater (although really a 2+2) and it was also styled by Bertone and not Pininfarina for the first time since 1953''. It was designed by Marcello Gandini who worked for design house Gruppo Bertone on the outskirts of Turin and is also known for his designs of the Lamborghini Miura, Lamborghini Countach and the Lamborghini Diablo. The cars construction included a tubular steel chassis with a steel body, but with an aluminium engine lid and front compartment lid to reduce weight and the chassis was based on the Ferrari Dino 246, but the wheelbase was stretched by 2,550.20mm to make room for the second row of seats. The suspension was fully independent, with double wishbones, anti-roll bars, coaxial telescopic shock absorbers and coil springs on both axles and it has 4-Wheel Disc Brakes. The 2926.90cc V8 all Aluminium Engine was mounted transversally and integrally joined with the 5-speed transaxle gearbox and has 16-valves and dual overhead camshafts, four twin choke Weber 40DCNF Carburettors and it produced 255bhp. In August 2021 Top Gear said:  “It's been one of the cheapest routes into Ferrari ownership since new. Don't misjudge it as a result, though - it's still a bewitching car to simply operate, never mind drive”. Having £50,000 to spend on a used Ferrari used to allow you to peruse the classifieds for F355's, but no more. The 308 GT4 is one of the few models that can claim the dubious credit of being so attainable, but we’d argue you want one of these more than you would want its Mondial successor for a few grand less, not least because it looks and feels the Seventies supercar part and way more bewitching to be around than you might expect of a Ferrari, not even originally marketed as one! It’s special at all speeds and takes a sense of occasion with it everywhere. If you buy carefully – from a specialist and with much inspection – you’ll end up with about an enthralling slice of exotica for the price of a clumsily specced Audi TT. And one that boasts roomier back seats too!''   https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/ferrari/308-gt4 This lovely original RHD example - Chassis No: F106ALA12796 and Engine No: F106A02101782 is a 'matching numbers' car and was supplied new by Maranello Concessionaires Ltd in Egham to a Mrs J Fry in Bramley near Guildford and was first registered on 18th January 1977. The car is finished in its original colour scheme of Rosso Corsa with a Crema half hide leather interior, Black carpets, Rear Seats, its original Momo Leather Steering Wheel, Electric Windows, Air-Conditioning, rare manual Sun Roof, a period Blaupunkt Radio and electric Aerial, its original 14'' Cromodora Alloy Wheels with relatively new Bridgestone Turanza 205/70/14 Tyres, original and unused Space-saver Wheel plus its original tool kit, jack, bulb kit and warning triangle. This is a very original example which has had some paint rectification during its lifetime and although the carpets have been replaced, the remainder of the interior is original and in very nice condition. It has a full and continuous detailed service history from new with the first 8 service/repair invoices in the file from from concessionaires Maranello in Egham from 1977 to 1984 + the remainder being from Ferrari specialists for routine annual Servicing, Cam Belt changes and repairs. It has all MOT certificates from its first one in 1980 through to 2006 when it was exported plus a record of its ownership right through to the previous owner who purchased the car and exported it to his home in Cyprus in October 2006. It also comes with its Owners Manual, a new Maintenance Book, Workshop Manual and other literature including Ferrari Owners Club documentation. The car remained in Cyprus for 15 years and was used by the owner on many regularity runs when he was in Cyprus until he decided to bring it back to the UK in November 2021. During its time in Cyprus it was serviced regularly, had a Cam Belt change every 3 years and the most recent annual service was carried out by the Ferrari Authorised Dealer Moto Trend Ltd in Nicosia, Cyprus on 3rd March 2021 at 85,315 miles. Works included an Oil Service and new Filters, Brake fluid change and a new Stainless Steel Brake Hose kit, replacement of the Timing Belt, full Carburettor overhaul plus new Fuel hoses, new front Track Rods, new cooling System Hoses and a new Cyprus MOT with the invoice amounting to €3,500. The fully documented mileage covered from new is now 85,527 miles and only 212 miles since it was last serviced. This car is one of only 547 RHD 308 GT4's built in total during its 7 year lifespan, but one of only 89 cars believed to have been built in 1977, so it is a rare car! It had been the previous owners pride and joy for almost 16 years and the decision to sell it did not come easily, but we did sell it for him in July 2022 to a car collector and since then it has been stored in a secure storage facility along with the rest of his collection, but due to personal reasons, he is now having to sell his collection, so we are very pleased to be able to offer the car for sale once again and find it a new owner. Upon sale, the car will come with a new MOT and our own customer care package including our HPI/provenance Check, 55-point pre-delivery inspection and our own 3 months mechanical breakdown Parts & Labour Warranty which can be upgraded and extended at additional cost if required.

{"name": "1989 FORD SIERRA RS COSWORTH - £39,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 27600 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This is a remarkably special car with an ultra-low mileage of 27600 and is incredibly original in many respects. This genuine Ford Sierra Sapphire Cosworth was built at the Genk, Belgium assembly plant in March 1989 as a Moonstone finished four door Cosworth with 2.0L DOHC engine. The car was built for the RHD UK market as confirmed on a Ford letter of authenticity. The Ford was then shipped new to Japan where it was kept completely original and from 1989 to 2005 it covered just 19535 miles. In 2005 the Cosworth was shipped to Canada where it spent seven years before coming to the UK in 2012 with 22410 miles.\nOur Sapphire Cosworth comes with an impressive spec to include full leather upholstery, air-conditioning and sunroof and the car comes with a very well documented, comprehensive history file. The car comes with an original Ford Sierra handbook, early history in Japan documenting maintenance at 4557, 10598, 13669 and 19535 miles. Having spent the seven years in Canada, it was brought to the UK and with a North London based owner who kept the car for four years. It was MOT tested at 22410 in the UK, but then not tested again when selling the car in 2016 at 22769 miles. During this period, the car was used for a magazine feature (Classic Car Mart) and a copy is in the history file.\n\nIn 2016 the car headed to one of our customers in Scotland and three years later in 2019, it was sold to a friend on the West Coast of Scotland, also a customer of ours. Over this period the car was superbly maintained and receipts are on file for front brake discs, pads and servo, four new tyres, replacement timing belt (2019), air-conditioning re-gas and the wheels were re-furbished. Maintenance and servicing has been recorded at 23000, 24036, 24243, 25054, 26500, 26703 and 26926 since heading to Scotland in 2016. We took the Cosworth in part exchange from our North West Scotland based customer and then sold it to one of our local regular long term customers who has covered and enjoyed around 500 faultless miles with the car. We serviced and MOT tested the Sierra prior to collection and it now returns ready to go.\n\nThe Cosworth has arrived back with us in exceptional, showroom condition. We'd go as far to say the car is immaculate with exceptional paintwork, perfect clean wheel arches, beautiful straight body panels, absolutely no major blemishes or defects. It's hard to fault the body, it appears incredibly original and its clear the car has led a very sheltered garaged life. The car has had no underside work, its original and as we'd expect a top class low mileage example. The interior is equally as impressive with stunning leather upholstery, exceptional dashboard, parcel shelf and carpets. This is a real time warp, top quality in every respect. The engine bay is original and stunning, clean and ready for the show scene. With the impressive maintenance., there's no surprise the Sierra drives perfectly offering impressive performance, road holding and braking. The car is ready to go, it's a pristine example with excellent paperwork that will not disappoint."}

The Rover even retains its original Henlys 1972 raised digit number plates.\nHenlys Ltd, Bromley Road, Catford, London supplied the Rover in January 1972, supplied in Ebony White with wing mirrors, underseal and heated rear window. The total sale price was £1761.88 and the supplying dealership Henlys carried out the first four services, five stamps in the service book including the P.D.I that was carried out on the 7th January 1972. By 1982 at ten years old the Rover had covered 26932 miles and according to the MOT certificates, it was back in use again in 2008 at 27311 miles. Eight MOT's follow on showing low mileage use since, with the Rover now arriving with us with 29400 miles. The car has been well maintained, and within the past 500 miles has had a new battery, coolant and hoses, exhaust system, tyres and the brake serviced. The Rover has been garaged its entire lift, explaining the original condition, and has had summer use for shows and events.\n\nThis is an incredibly original car, a time warp but importantly it's such a strong, reliable and practical car, certainly ideal for regular local use. The car presents as it was a few years old, its remarkably honest and with the exception of an electronic ignition module, the car is unbelievably correct and original. The Rover was supplied new undersealed, and as result the car is structurally outstanding having never been exposed to the elements or left to deteriorate. The bodywork is first class with factory original gaps, the paintwork of a lovely standard and the upholstery beautiful. On the road the P6 is very impressive, it is quiet, smooth and very relaxed, the automatic transmissions offers a very pleasant driving experience and it does not disappoint. This must be one of the lowest mileage Rover P6's available, and finding another example in this condition that has had one owner for 36 years and comes with such impressive early paperwork will be difficult to repeat."}

This car is designated as an 'SE' - Special Equipment model and only 753 of these versions were made, so this is a very rare car today! It is finished in its original specification of Black with its original Red Leather Trim, new Red Carpets, a refurbished Burr Walnut Dashboard, its original and rebuilt 3.4 Litre S6 Engine, 4 Speed Gearbox with Overdrive, Cooper-Craft front Brakes, new 'Electric Power Steering', Facet Fuel Pump, MWS 72 Spoke Chrome Wire Wheels, Wooden Mota-Lita Steering Wheel and a 'Retro Sound' AM/FM Radio. There are letters and hand-written receipts from the first 3 owners in the history file confirming the originality and also the mileage of the car when each of them sold the car and it was most noticeably sold by Jaguar XK specialist Twyford Moors to a Mr Peter Reid from Dorchester, Dorset on 20th December 2007 when the mileage covered was only 27,276. Mr Reid kept a full log of all of his expenditure on the car during his 7 years of ownership and this amounted to almost £30,000! Works included an Engine rebuild in April 2009 (mileage 29,348) and a full body restoration and repaint in 2010. Copies of every invoice for his expenditure is contained in the history file. Mr Reid sold the car to a Mr David Carr from Ringwood in Hampshire in September 2014 when the mileage was 42,516 and he had the car serviced by Independent Jaguar specialist Hollygrove in Ringwood until moving to Mortlake in South West London in 2015 when the car went to well-known Jaguar specialist Chris Coleman of the Jaguar Workshop in Ealing, West London. Mr Carr has also spent the best part of £10,000 on the car during his ownership which included the fitting of the 'Electric Power Steering'  in 2017 (£4,620) by Chris Coleman along with routine servicing and MOT's. We sold the car for Mr Carr in September 2018 to a long standing customer of ours when the mileage was 45,980 and he has only driven approximately 2,500 miles during his 4 years of ownership and the total mileage covered by this car now is only a genuine 48,550 from new, but only just over 19,000 miles since the Engine was rebuilt back in 2009. It has an exceptional service history with a ring-binder full of invoices for all works and new parts fitted, MOT certificates, full ownership history, its original XK Operating Manual and Service Handbook, Jaguar Heritage Certificate and a certificate for coming 3rd in a Jaguar Drivers Club Concourse event back in 1972.  Having recently sold our customer another car, we are delighted to be given the chance to offer this fantastic car for sale again. It really is a beautiful car to drive, especially with the electric power steering and we recommend that it should be seen, inspected and driven to be fully appreciated.

Designed by 993 stylist Tony Hatter, with a longer and wider track, the 991 brought back elegance back to the 911 cars. The longer wheelbase improves stability and the wider track means that a slightly milder anti-roll bar could be employed at the front, thus reducing the tendency to understeer, an inherent 911 trait.  As it stands, the revised front and rear running gear combined with the larger dimensions make the 991 a different handling Porsche than the 997, particularly in terms of stability.\n\nClever use of aluminium panels, (the skin is 45 % aluminium and magnesium), enabled Porsche to reduce the weight of the 991 Carrera Cabriolet to 1,450 kg, which is quite an achievement given that 58kg of additional  ‘safety products’ had to be added to the new version.\n\nAlso noticeable is the ‘corporate’ raised centre console housing the gearshift, a development first seen on the Carrera GT. The handbrake lever was replaced by an electric parking brake. The combination of more space and richer materials has elevated the 911’s cockpit to a distinctly ‘grand touring’ environment rather than that of a mere topflight sports car. The 3,436cc engine produces 345 bhp. Performance figures show a top speed of 178 mph, and a 0-62 mph acceleration time of just 5.0 secs.\n\nSupplied new by Porsche in September 2014, our 991 Cabriolet has a large factory options list and a full servicing history. It has benefited from a recent Porsche specification service including spark plugs, brake fluid change, air conditioning service and a new N-rated tyre set The 991 Cabriolets now represent excellent Porsche value in the marketplace, and with naturally aspirated Porsches become ever-more desirable, this is an opportunity to acquire a well-equipped example at a realistic value. A 12-month written warranty will also be included.\n\nAvailable to view now at our London showrooms."}

A hand built, 4.0-litre V8 with twin-turbochargers, a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox, multi-link suspension and a low centre of gravity, it has all the best sports car ingredients.

It’s already viewed as a desirable, practical, and usable modern classic that can be driven regularly, with the very best and rarest versions are now the most sought after amongst collectors.\n \nThe Bremen-built R129 was offered as a two-door roadster with an automated fabric convertible roof; colour-matched, automated tonneau cover and a manually detachable hardtop that could be fitted over the stored fabric convertible roof and tonneau.  The new SL-class was presented at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1989, with left-hand drive sales beginning that summer and right-hand drive sales in Autumn 1989.  There were several advances on the R129 which propelled the Mercedes brand into the technology revolution. New safety standards were set, and for the first time in any convertible, an automatic rollover bar was introduced. Producing 322 hp at 5,500 rpm, the 8-cylinder, 4973cc SL 500 easily reached its 155 miles per hour limited top speed.\n\nThe designers’ meticulous attention to detail in styling, efficiency and safety means that this car takes a worthy position in the Mercedes-Benz Hall of Fame.  Illustrious owners of the R129 included Diana, Princess of Wales, who sold her Jaguar XJS to lease a metallic-red SL 500 and became the first member of the royal family to use a foreign car. Media pressure eventually forced her to return the car to Mercedes-Benz in 1992. It now resides in the Mercedes-Benz Museum.\n\nSupplied new in 2001 by Foreign Motors West Inc.

{"name": "1987 MERCEDES BENZ 300SL - £POA ", "transmission": " 4-SPEED AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 18724 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Mercedes-Benz R107 series sports cars were produced between 1971 and 1989, when replaced by the R129 series SL-Class, with around 240,000 built during that period. They were offered with a number of different engine options - initially just a V8, then a smaller capacity straight 6 as well. \n\nThe R107 used the chassis components of the midsize Mercedes-Benz W114 saloon series, but in a shorter-wheelbase, 2-seat, convertible/roadster style with standard soft-top, and optional hardtop. The body style did not materially change from their introduction in 1971 through to the end of production in 1989. \n\nThe 300SL model was available from September 1985, fitted with a 3.0 litre straight 6 engine, Bosch fuel injection and a 4-speed automatic transmission. The car offered here was registered new, in Jersey, in September 1987. Essentially in the hands of only 2 owners since that date, it has covered less than 19,000 miles and really can be described as being in an ‘as new‘ condition. \n\nWith a full dealer service record and having covered a very low mileage, this car runs and drives exactly as it should, with the solid feel of a near-new vehicle. \n\nHaving been garaged and cosseted throughout its life, the bodywork is in immaculate condition with hardly a blemish to betray its age. The Arctic White paintwork is near perfect in every respect. The underside of the car is very clean with only a few small spots of surface rust. The engine bay is tidy and very presentable with the bonnet sound-deadening lining freshly replaced. The hardtop is in excellent condition, as is the folding hood which appears not to have been used previously. \n\nWith such limited use, as might be expected, the interior is in near-pristine condition. The blue leather seats are unmarked with only the slightest patination; the dashboard and doorcards are in excellent shape; even the carpets display very little sign of use. The interior of the hardtop is spotless.  \n\nAlthough this Mercedes is actually 35 years old, its original unmarked condition would suggest it had only been around a couple of years at most. To find a classic car like this is not an everyday occurrence. As such, it offers a rare opportunity to acquire a desirable SL Class roadster with a very low mileage and in as near as possible ‘new’ condition – visually stunning and fully functional in every respect. \n\nThe car is currently Jersey registered and we can assist with shipping and importation processes if required. £ POA"}
{"name": "1999 JAGUAR XKR 4.0 V8 - £9,950 ", "transmission": " 5-SPEED AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 63695 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Jaguar XKR was a more powerful, sporting version of the Jaguar XK8 and first appeared in 1998, 2 years after the XK8 made its debut. The XK8 replaced the long-running XJS model and the styling harked back to the E-Type of the Sixties – swooping body lines and large, forward-hinged bonnet. It was available in both coupé and convertible form.\n\nThe XKR used the same 4.0 litre, 32-valve V8 engine as its sister model but added a supercharger – boosting the claimed power output to 370 bhp which, mated to its Mercedes-sourced 5-speed gearbox, allowed the car to reach its top speed (limited to 155 mph) with alacrity (0-60 mph in a little over 5 seconds). Visually, the XKR gained cooling louvres in the bonnet, a mesh grille, small bootlid spoiler and 18” alloy wheels. The interior was typically Jaguar - sumptuously furnished with leather and wood trim.\n\nThis car was first registered in September 1999 and spent much of its life in the UK, prior to being exported to, and re-registered in, Jersey. With only 2 owners, the second has had the Jaguar since 2002. It has seen limited use during its life with just 64,000 miles showing and has been well-cared for throughout. We have the Jaguar service record from purchase up to 2015 and invoices for subsequent work. \n\nThis is a very fast car! As might be anticipated, given careful ownership, this car is in excellent mechanical fettle. It drives very well, with everything working as it should. \n\nThe body is generally in a very good condition – the bodywork is almost unmarked and the bright red paintwork gleams. There is some very minor paint chipping on a couple of the alloy wheels. \n\nThe XKR cabin is a luxurious place to be and very well finished. The leather and wood trim is in very good condition throughout – the leather seats showing just a little patination. There are two rear seats – but these are best considered as optional accommodation.\n\nA 1990’s high performance Jaguar – and it will not disappoint in that respect even today. Well maintained and with a good service record, this is a very clean and well-presented car, ready for regular use with a new owner. \n\nThe car is currently Jersey registered and we can assist with overseas shipping and importation processes if required, but any import duties and transport costs would be additional to the price listed."}

Finished in red with a black leather interior, this stunning car is the result of a total nut and bolt restoration at the hands of a previous owner in 2012/13. Every part of the car has been attended to, with either new parts fitted or originals refinished where appropriate. The entire process was photographically logged and these pictures, along with lots of invoices for parts, are included in the history file. The chassis was powder coated and Waxoyled ensuring that the underside of the car was as good as the top and all the trim and weather equipment was renewed. The engine was rebuilt and the original fuel injection system was replaced with triple 40 DCOE Weber carburettors which, when coupled with the stainless steel exhaust system, gives the car a throaty roar on start-up.\n\nThe increased performance necessitated that the cooling was upgraded so a Kenlowe fan was fitted, and the suspension was uprated to cope with higher cornering speeds. Having only covered a couple of thousand miles since the restoration, the car still presents incredibly well.\n\nSupplied with a good history file, this TR6 is undoubtedly one of the best examples we have ever offered and also drives as well as she looks.\n\nNow recently fitted with 72 spoke Cross laced style wire wheels and new tyres.\n\nSupplied fully inspected, serviced and 12 months warranty."}

The engine is a 1275 mpi and runs smoothly and has been trouble free during my ownership of 4 years. Always starts first time and pulls very well. Lots of history is available from previous owners. The car has been upgraded with the Cooper Sportspack 13” wheels and arches. Tyres are a couple of years old and have plenty of tread left. Bodywork is in good condition but is showing some signs of age with some light bubbling in areas. The sills will need some attention in the coming years as per recent advisories. The car has been garaged during my ownership. The interior is in great condition and original working Mini branded cassette player is included. 2 sets of keys and alarm fobs. All Paul Smith extras included like tool bag and Green boot board. Private plate will be removed and original number plate T72 BAN will go back on. £10,495 ono."}

According to the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, it is still finished in its original colour scheme of Sienna Metallic (Z5Z5) with a Tan leatherette interior with Pin Stripe Beige Velour seat inlays and with the optional equipment of Impact Absorbers, Cruise Control, Coloured (tinted) Windows, Centre Consul and Sun Roof and it was also specified with the Porsche 3-Speed Sportomatic Gearbox, however like most, this was later swapped for a traditional 5 Speed Manual Gearbox during the 1980's. The car has been maintained and restored by a number of renowned Porsche main dealers and specialists for its previous owners including AFN, Malaya Garage, A Bianchi, Autofarm, Chris Turner, Cotswold Porsche, RGA Porsche Centre and Paul Stephens who sold the car to the current owner in April 2019. Works carried out on the car over the last 10 years are detailed on Paul Stephens letter to the new owner at the time of sale and these included a full bare metal respray, kidney bowl and sill repairs, new shock absorbers, new Exhaust system, engine out with many seals replaced, fuel injection system overhaul, Gearbox overhaul + new Clutch, new fuel tank, complete electrical system overhaul, Brake overhaul, new Cookie Cutter Alloy Wheels and many other new components as detailed on all the invoices. Since purchase in 2019, the current owner has taken the car to Porschetech Ltd in Hampstead and they replaced the Sun Roof gearbox and guides and renewed the heater controls and adjusted the clutch - £2,529.91 and the car has now covered a genuine 117,312 miles from new with an extensive service history file which includes its original Porsche wallet and Drivers Manual, Porsche letter of Authenticity, invoices dating back to the early 1980's, MOT certificates and old V5 registration documents and a clear HPi check & Certificate. Due to some stone damage and scratches on the front bumper and bonnet, we have just had GP Auto Design in Park Royal, London repaint the front of the car and it now really is in exceptional condition throughout and really needs to be seen and driven to be fully appreciated.

Still wears it's original gleaming Carmine Red paintwork with pride. As you might expect from a car approaching it's 45th birthday, there have been a few minor touch-ins over the years and there are occasional thread lines in the paint but you need to look closely to see them. The underside is in excellent order as are the external panels. The wheel arches, wings, doors and sills are all perfect and appear to be exactly as the car left the factory with visible spot welds etc. The rubber bumpers, glass, chrome and all other trim remain in excellent condition as do the factory fit Rostyle wheels shod with matching tyres which have only covered a couple of thousand miles. A set of genuine MG mud flaps complete the picture. All original panels and beautiful coachwork in Carmine red, finished and maintained with Zymol Carnuba wax, I have just a few weeks ago put the car through MG head offices garage in Swavessy Cambridgeshire for a full service, tune and health check and it has come back with flying colours on the report.

MK IV Lightweight Cobra & 428 Frua Spider with manual gears just two of the examples to have graced his garage\n\nAnyhow knowing AC so well he without hesitation took on this fantastic car in 2019 and has subsequently enjoyed about 7000 miles in her\n\nAutokrafkt began life as an AC specialist run by a gentleman called Brian Angliss, they dealt mainly with restorations and manufacturing of parts for AC motorcars and were world leaders at what they did\n\nAC Car Ltd like most British manufacturing businesses in the 1980s were struggling financially and Brian Angliss was determined to buy the business with Ford in the backgroud as his partner and engine supplier\n\nAfter much jostling and persuasion, Derek Hurlock - whose father William and uncle Charles had bought AC Cars Ltd in the 1930s - sold the business to Angliss in 1986. Hurlock had long been the careful and considered custodian of AC Cars Ltd and was duly measured in allowing someone from outside the Hurlock family to take on the responsibility\n\nIn Angliss he could be confident that AC Cars Ltd were under the charges of someone who both appreciated the history of the brand and perhaps more importantly was already a well accomplished expert whose bredth of knowledge and experience with AC Cars was unrivalled\n\nNow back to the car...\n\nRather pleasingly this particular example is as she left the factory in 1988 having never been restored or in any way tampered with, good enough for Derek Hurlock is definitely good enough\n\nFeaturing a 5 litre fuel injected Ford V8 and a 5 speed manual gearbox she roars her way up the road in a decidedly conspicuous fashion\n\nThe engine is velvet smooth and very much the benefactor of never having been converted to carburettors as so many of these late Cobras have. The drivetrain as a whole is monstrously good and the noise she gives off, otherworldly\n\nOn close inspection she actually belies her already low mileage of 17,000 miles. One could quite easily believe that she had just been restored or indeed barely turned a wheel since leaving the factory in '88\n\nIn fact the reality is that she was a brilliantly well made car that has been looked after brilliantly well by two genuinely caring owners\n\nShe still today has all the original weather equipment - tonneau cover side screens etc - as well as her original steering wheel, she currently wears a rather dashing Moto-Lita but the original will of course remain with the car in the sale\n\nHer colour - Porsche Guards Red - pops in the sun and sits so well on the car without a blemish in sight, together with the sensible choice of black leather interior on black halibrand wheels with polished rims and gold knock off centre nuts we think that the spec is just purrrfect\n\nA car well known by true enthusiasts and importantly she is registered on the Shelby World Register\n\nSurely she wont be around for long..."}

On his behalf we had the engine built by our friend John Eales (you know the chap who developed the 4.2 litre version of the V8 used by the factory for the original LSE) and had the gearbox rebuilt at the same time\n\nWe asked for an engine with lots of mid range power rather than a high revving unit - much better in the real world - he dutifully obliged and we now have an engine with grunt on demand giving amazing acceleration\n\nOne of the photograph's shows the dyno test included in the history folder showing the full fat 292ft / lbs of torque & 252bhp\n\nA massive history folder it is too, including two service stamp voucher booklets, with 22 stamps therein, MoT's going back to her first in 1996 and tax discs going back to 1998\n\nAbsolutely amazing - and naturally with all this supporting her when we came to give her a run around the block she was, unsurprisingly, without fault\n\nUpgraded coil suspension has been fitted and works supremely well, freezing cold air conditioning, smooth drive train with no slack, and all electrical items performing correctly\n\nShe also has the Brooklands body kit, as those of you keen on the brand would have already noticed\n\nThe pictures speak for themselves cosmetically and the choice of materials and the finish leaves this LSE far ahead of any other\n\nObviously everyone concerned has always ensured that mechanically she's been kept in top fettle - as you would have expected - with the John Eales engine upgrade this must be one of, if not the , best LSE's out there\n\nBrakes have been updated as well as the suspension so she handles as well as she goes - and my does she go\n\nStainless steel exhaust system including free flow manifold and an aluminium radiator with an enormous fan have also been fitted\n\nHer mid-range acceleration is astonishing whilst cruising at 85mph is a doddle, with plenty of urge left in the tank\n\nOh and recently she has been completely repainted in this lovely dark green - previously she was gunmetal\n\nWe've had a few Overfinch Range Rover's in the past and to be perfectly fair, in our opinion the 4.6 litre engine upgrade by John Eales is much better\n\nWith only 8,500 miles since completion she is barely run in and we think the best around!\n\nThe gun case, cartridge case, Fortnum's picnic hamper and the Burberry rug are props for fun only "}

It arrives with us in strong mechanical condition, driving beautifully in true Bentley style. The car offers performance, luxury and comfort, and presents very well with impressive Brewster Green paintwork, clean, straight body panels and a lovely Parchment leather upholstery. This is a very usable Bentley, it's very smooth and enjoyable to drive and works for both local short driving as its last owner found, but also makes a fabulous car for longer distance touring.

The car sold locally to its second owner in Southport in 2006, and in 2009 came into the hands of its most recent owner who is now based not far from us in Yorkshire.\nThe supplying dealership Westwood Garage Ltd maintained the car for its first twenty years with services stamped in the book at 987, 4056, 9553, 11239, 13001, 14311, 16033, 17449, 24796, 25600, 26301, 27833 and 28118 miles. In 2001 the long term first owner had the car serviced with Mercedes Benz of Blackpool and for the final few years of ownership a local garage serviced the SL at 28635, 28885, 29104 and 29133 miles before selling the car in 2006. The recent owner has kept the SL in excellent order with regular maintenance, and in recent years has had the SL Shop carry out a re-commissioning program on the car. Servicing was carried out by independent garages at 30760, 31457 and 31501 miles but a major re-commissioning program was carried out by the SL Shop at 31181 miles in 2015 at a cost of around £4500.\n\nThe SL had been dry stored for a couple of years prior to 2015 and the owner commissioned a major service, MOT and any recommended work to be carried out. Expenditure covered brand new tyres, refurbished steering box, stripping the differential and fitting new seals, new fuel tank link pipes, rear Bilstein shock absorbers, complete set of new fuses, engine and gearbox service, new soft top seal, wind deflector and new mohair hood. The SL has been serviced twice since the work even though it's covered little over 500 miles.\n\nLFR 686W has been kept in exceptional, sharp condition and used sparingly. It presents beautifully with stunning, gleaming paintwork and chrome, the bodywork is exceptional with first class straight panels and with gleaming period alloys, superb hard top and soft top, and a wonderful low mileage interior, this SL really does look the part. The interior boasts beautiful wood veneer finishes, lambswool over rugs, lovely carpets and excellent seats, door cards and dash. The boot compartment is well presented, the spare wheel looks unused and the engine bay is very well presented. On the road the SL drives correctly with impressive performance from the V8 engine, smooth gear changes and first class handling, road holding and braking. This is an exceptional low mileage car that does not disappoint and has the provenance of low ownership and a very comprehensive history from new."}

The car since it’s importation has always been garaged and has never had any panels or floor parts replaced all of which remain totally solid.\nThe engine which has been left with its original patina has been serviced regularly and runs faultlessly, it had covered 57000kms (35509miles) when imported in Sept 1980 with only an additional 950 miles added in the last 43 years.

A new fuel pump has also been added.\nThe Gamine was one of the rarest cars produced by Carrozzeria Vignale and less than 400 cars left the factory between 1967 and 1971, it is estimated that there are fewer than 20 cars left in the U. K. today. This example from Southern Italy was only used as a summer car, I purchased it in 1979 and drove it back to the U.

The worlds press also agreed and it was voted Car of the Year at its launch.\n\nIn 1986 Jaguar launched the XJ40. At this point the XJ series 3 six-cylinder car was discontinued. However, as the new XJ40 was not developed to take the V12 engine, the XJ series 3 would continue in production until 1992.\n\nThe XJ series 3 from 1986 to the end of its production were built as Daimler V12’s (aside from the penultimate car) and only for UK, Japan, Germany and Canadian markets.\n\nJ115RDU was registered by Jaguar Cars Ltd on the 29th of October 1991 but did not officially go on the road until October 1992. During this time, it stayed within Jaguar Car, Browns Lane. This happened to certain cars as they were used to assess build quality or for journalists to test drive, but by the XJ40 was available as a V12 and all the magazines was for the new car and not the retiring Series 3.\n\nThe car was then sold out of the Jaguar stable via its dealership network and a second owner became its next custodian. In time the car was sold on, but the new owner did not find time to enjoy the car.\n\nCoincidentally in 1998, the Curator of the Jaguar Land Rover Heritage Trust (Tony O’Keeffe) was summoned by the Chairman of Jaguar Cars (Sir Nick Sheele), asking if he could source a Daimler Double Six as a gift for Lady Sheele’s birthday.\n\nJ115 RDU was found for sale at the TWR Jaguar dealership in Oxford with just 15,000 miles covered from new and its work history made the car even more appealing.\n\nUpon leaving Jaguar, Sir Nick Sheele went onto to become the Chairman of Ford Great Britain and then Chairman of Ford. Upon his retirement Sir Nick and Lady Sheele employed their Jaguar chauffeur to continue to  look after J115RDU and to drive them to special events and occasions.\n\nUpon the passing of Sir Nick, Lady Sheele approached Tony O’Keeffe as she wished to sell the car. Tony had fond memories of J115RDU and in 2016 agreed to buy the car, which he then had fully serviced by Sturgess of Leicester Ltd, Thereafter the car was used sparingly in between its professional in door storage.\n\nIn November 2020 the car was featured in Jaguar World Magazine and in 2021the car came to Cariconics Ltd in preparation for sale.\n\nThe interior and exterior of the car are in remarkable condition.\n\nIn 2021 the front and rear subframes were removed, sandblasted and powder coated. The rebuild included all new bearings and bushes, including upper and lower ball joints. The calipers were reconditioned and the front discs were replaced.

The 4.0l 32 valve AJ-V8 provides 290hp and 0-60mph in just under 7 seconds. Paired with the ZF 5-speed automatic gearbox allows smooth cruising with the ability to put some pace down when required. Understandably there are a number of Jaguar XK8s on the market at present. However, the previous owner of this particular car has been meticulous in caring for her since 2003. Having recently undergone a major refurbishment in 2021. The XK8 has had any corrosion removed and replaced with new panels before undergoing a full strip down and bare metal respray, followed by an extensive anticorrosion wax protection process. This work was carried out by David Marks Garages, a renowned specialist in the Jaguar world supported by an abundance of invoices and a letter of completion. With invoices over the last 3 years adding up to nearly &pound;15,000 it clear that this car has not been left uncared for as with many other XK8s. Previous to its most recent new lease of life, the Jaguar also has invoices dating back to 2003 showing all major service works and MOTs. Overall, this example showing just less than 72,000 miles is certainly not showing its age. A useable modern classic that is awaiting its next custodian.

The original log book confirms the first owner of this important car was the Marquis of Exeter. I have done some research and have two fascinating stories written by the Marquis's daughter about two adventures in this car. Over the last 20 years the car has been the subject of meticulous refurbishment, whilst retaining it's original patina. The engine has just been rebuilt by Moss Jaguar and has covered around 750 miles since the rebuild. The car has been resprayed back to it's original colour Dark Opalescent Blue. The four chrome wire wheels were renewed. The brakes were uprated to 'Cooper Craft' calipers. The petrol pump was uprated, as was the distributor which is now electronic ignition. The starter motor was uprated, as was the heater motor. Essentially, this car has been the subject of a number of improvements to make it safe in today's traffic. However, I have kept all the original components. The car still has it's original Red leather and carpets which are in surprisingly good condition considering they are over 60 years old.

{"name": "1977 DAIMLER SOVEREIGN - £47,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "It is not very often we have the pleasure of selling a Jaguar/Daimler that has been through Jaguar Land Rover Classic Works at Coventry. NFU 17R has so many selling points, but having been subject of a bare shell rebuild, then later an extensive re-commissioning by Classic Works, they don’t really get any better than this. JLR Classic later sold the Daimler, advertising the car for £49,995 and it has since then been treasured, kept in outstanding condition and arrives with us in truly outstanding condition. There is no doubt this is an incredibly special car in its own right and with only 1600 manufactured, and likely just a few hundred left on the road, the Daimler Sovereign Series 2 Coupe is an ultra-rare collectors piece.\nThe Daimler Sovereign version of the Jaguar XJC was identified by its fluted radiator grill with the scripted ‘D' badge in the centre and examples likes this are difficult to find. Supplied new by G Mansbridge of Lincoln, the Daimler was first registered on 5th April 1977 and comes with a wonderful extensive history. Finished in Old English White with Russett velour trim and optional Kent alloys, the Daimler was supplied new to a North Lincolnshire company W Graham & Sons Ltd who are still in business today, and was registered with the private registration mark 1 EFU. In 1979 at two years old the Daimler as sold and was in South Kelsey, Lincoln and in 1983 the Daimler made its way to Middlesbrough, but spent just three months with its third owner. In late 1983, with 62,225 miles covered over six years, the Daimler sold to a gentleman in Darlington who kept the car an impressive 32 years and covered around 27000 miles in the car.\n\nA wonderful history file accompanies the car with MOT's back to 1983, mileage logs and pages and pages of invoices throughout the 1980's, 1990's and 2000's. In 2016 the Daimler was inspected after restoration by CMC with a mileage of 89078 and at 91000 miles went to JLR Classic for some re-commissioning work before being sold. During 2023 NFU 17R has been serviced, and prior to coming to us fitted with brand new rear brake calipers and pads, and arrives having covered 93,000 miles, and just 2000 miles since its JLR extensive preparation. Having been subject of an impressive rebuild, the Daimler presents like an ultra-low mileage car. The bodywork, shut lines and panels are pristine, the paintwork beautiful, chrome work first class and the upholstery truly outstanding. The underside is quite simply exquisite, and on the road equally impressive with impressive power, performance, comfort and luxury. The engine has no major oil leaks, has excellent compressions and oil pressure, the automatic gearbox is lovely and smooth and the car rides, handles and brakes superbly. This is a car that really has everything, and without doubt is the finest example we have had the pleasure of selling."}

The service history confirms HR Owen serviced the car six times from 1989 to 1993 when the mileage was recorded at 36801 miles, and St Johns Wood London Bentley and Rolls Royce Engineers C.D Carriage Company and Rolls Royce agents Royal Crown Motors in Madrid have looked after the Rolls Royce for the majority of time since then.\nSupplied new in Alpine White with mohair Blue hood and Polar White piped with Blue leather interior, the Rolls Royce spent its early life in London, first registered PR 25. By 1995 at six years old it was registered to a private owner on the famous Portobello Road, Notting Hill before being sold by Jack Barclay Ltd in Berkeley Square in 1997 to its next owner of 19 years, the founder of a global law firm. The Spanish owner registered the car at his St James' St address, and later Holborn address but did take the Rolls Royce to Madrid where it spent some years. Over the 19 years both in the UK, and over on the Continent the Rolls Royce covered almost 20,000 miles.\n\nIn 2016 the Rolls Royce sold to its most recent owner, a classic car collector both in the UK and over in the USA. The Corniche has been kept dry stored in Surrey with a collection of magnificent cars, and initially covered around 200 miles between 2016 and 2020. Having been carefully dry stored since 2020, the Rolls Royce will now be fully serviced, prepared and MOT tested for its next owner. A8 FSG presents beautifully with gleaming Alpine White paintwork, the bodywork is exceptional throughout and the original upholstery is of a lovely standard.

The B Roaster left the factory in Teal Blue with Autumn Leaf upholstery and was sold new by Wheatey Motors Ltd, Stockton on Tees. YDC 550J was supplied new with Rostyle wheels, heater, tonneau cover, seatbelts and overdrive.\nIn 1995 the MGB had a recorded mileage of 75,522 and over 12 years covered little under 1500 miles. The MGB was then taken off the road in 2005 and having been left for 15 years, in 2020 it was subject of a major restoration with just running in miles covered since. The MGB first came to us last year and sold to one of our regular customers who has now part exchanged the MGB for his next classic.\n\nThe MGB was taken to a Hertfordshire based specialist and the car fully stripped down for assessment. The body was then subject of fabrication work, preparation and then a full re-paint including underbody in the cars original colour of Teal Blue. The car was mechanically and electrically overhauled and the engine stripped down for rebuild. The engine block was re-bored, new pistons and rings supplied and fitted, new main bearing shells, oil pump and new timing chain fitted. The engine was built up with all new gaskets, the cylinder head rebuilt, clutch replaced, and the carbs fully rebuilt. The brakes were all renewed with new pads and discs, the front suspension rebuilt with poly bushes, the overdrive stripped and rebuilt with new gaskets. The gearbox, steering rack and suspension were checked, blasted, re-painted and re-fitted to the car.\n\nYDC 550J was built up with renewed or replaced brightwork, Halogen headlamps, new wheels and tyres, re-furbished hard top, new hood and re-trimmed upholstery. The MGB was finished with excellent attention to detail with a show level engine bay, exceptional clean inner arches, immaculate boot compartment and generally excellent finish. On the road the MGB is fantastic fun with excellent performance, handling, and braking. The engine is super fit, gearbox and overdrive smooth, and the car is ready for summer touring, shows and events. This car should not disappoint, it's presents beautifully, is first class on the road and is a competitively priced example that is incredibly well detailed."}

Whilst largely being an updated version of the previous generation platform, visually it acquired many styling cues reminiscent of the original 1960’s models. The standard engine fitted to the car was a 3.8 litre, OHV V6 rated at 145 bhp, and in this instance, mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox. Production continued until the introduction of the 5th generation model in 2005.\n\nThis car was first sold in the USA in October 1996 but was exported to and re-registered in the UK a year later. It then spent much of its life in the UK, in the hands of just 2 owners, prior to being imported to Jersey in February 2020. There is a thick history file dating from 1998, including invoices for maintenance and repair work carried out, together with UK MOT certificates up to 2020. \n\nMechanically, this Mustang has been well cared for throughout its life and starts, runs and drives exactly as it should. \n\nThe bodywork is virtually blemish-free, in metallic red with silver stripes. 18-inch, chrome-finish alloy wheels have been fitted.\n\nAs may be seen, the interior of the car is in excellent original condition, with few visible signs to indicate its age.

More recently the car was used regularly as a wedding car around Retford.  The restoration has retained its quality having had very light use since its restoration. I bought the car from a collection in 2014 and have done some general upkeep work on it, but haven't been able to use it as much as it deserves since then, due to a variety of medical issues and Covid restrictions – hence the sad decision to sell.

It is a solid, sound and reliable example in everyday use and has been refurbished and renovated over the 3 years I have owned it. Sills and front wings were fitted at some time before my ownership and are still sound as is all the underside. Brakes have been refurbished including master cylinder rubbers and steel pipes.

Finished in the best colour combination of Rootes Pearl Grey (I'd call it cream) and Antelope. The column change and bags of low down pull make easy town/traffic driving and will hold 50-60 mph easily on journeys.

{"name": "1975 TRIUMPH TR6 - £26,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This incredibly correct Triumph TR6 is a UK Home Market, RHD example that is a matching numbers cars, still in its original colours of Triumph White with Black vinyl upholstery. GOW 612N comes with an exceptional history and spent 42 years with one owner in South Wales. The comprehensive file retains the sales invoice from 1979 to its long term owner, supplied by Caterham Cars Sales in Surrey. In 2021 the TR6 came into the hands of the owner of a design lead tailoring business with studios in Shoreditch, London and North Laine, Brighton and having had a couple of years of enjoyable motoring, the TR6 has been fully serviced, MOT tested and fitted with a new set of tyres before being collected by us down in Sussex.\nThis is essentially a largely original car that has been kept in regular use its entire life, but maintained and kept up too with no expense spared. Never deteriorating to the point where it has required full rebuild, it has just been kept on top of in strong mechanical condition, and impressive cosmetic its entire life. A huge file of invoices are on file but the headlines for expenditure were 10,000 miles back in 2003 when the TR6 was taken to a classic car specialists for a light body refurbishment that included removal of the wings, and the rolling shell then being prepared for a full re-paint, and more recently in 2013 2000 miles ago, an engine rebuild to include new pistons, main and big end bearings, thrust bearings, cam followers, unleaded head conversion, timing chain, rebore, crankshaft re-grind and gearbox rebuild. Invoices are also on file within the past few thousand miles for brake calipers, discs and pads, metering unit, clutch, water pump, starter motor and ring gear. Recently the TR6 has also had a new fuel pump, new poly trailing arm bushes in 2021 and prior to arriving with us had new tyres, new top ball joints, swivel joints, new metering unit vacuum hose, a full service and MOT.\n\nThe TR6 has arrived with us in excellent mechanical condition, the engine just a couple of thousand miles on since rebuild is excellent holding impressive oil pressure and offers exceptional performance. The rebuilt gearbox is smooth with nice changes, the overdrive kicks is smoothly and the TR6 handles incredibly well. Having being MOT consistently each year the car has been properly maintained and checked over to ensure roadworthiness, reliability and the optimum TR6 performance. GOW 612N presents beautifully with a gleaming paint finish, lovely straight panels, excellent chrome work and a clean, well presented engine bay and boot compartment. The hood is excellent, the interior very well presented with correct seats and door cards, clean carpets, dashboard and instruments.

He looked after the car through his workshop during his fourteen year ownership, eventually selling it to the last owner in 2017. \n\nThey have continued the fantastic care of this rare car, recently having the gearbox fully rebuilt, the carburettors fettled and the cambelt replaced, as part of a thorough re-commissioning programme.\n\nAs well as numerous invoices for ongoing care, there are MOT certificates in the file going back to 1982.\n\nThe Lotus drives beautifully with crisp gear changes, very good road manners having had work to the suspension and brakes, and the engine behaves properly, idling nicely at traffic lights and keeping the correct temperature.\n\nThe bodywork is excellent and has never been painted, and the original interior is fantastic with the wonderful fabric dashboard, and leather seats which have minimal wear.

{"name": "1998 ASTON MARTIN VOLANTE V8 LWB - £139,995 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 21902 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "V8 Volante Long Wheelbase (LWB)\n(1997 – 1999)\nThe long chassis V8 Volante is perhaps the most elegant Aston Martin that was ever built. It is also the longest production Aston until the introduction of the Rapide in 2010 but is without doubt still the heaviest. It was unveiled at the 1997 London Motor Show and has a unique wheelbase not shared with any other model. It was also the last production Volante to be made at Newport Pagnell. The long wheelbase V8 Volante shares it’s styling and mechanicals with the V8 Coupe which was introduced the previous year. It was a little late in appearing as the car it replaced, the Virage Volante, was a little slow at selling through at the dealers.\n\nAlthough a heavy car, tipping the scales at 2050kg empty, the car is capable of a maximum speed in excess of 150mph, with 60mph coming from rest in 6.5 seconds. Power is provided by a 354 bhp V8 engine, still displacing 5340cc and virtually identical to that used in the V8 Coupe. It was only ever available with automatic transmission, a four speed version of the classic Chrysler Torqueflite with a lock-up torque converter and switchable sport mode.\n\nThe elegant LWB Volante is far roomier for rear seat passengers with an additional 200mm of leg room over the Virage Volante 2+2. This makes it an ideal Aston for families as average sized people can be very comfortable in the back. The extra leg room and additional luggage capacity has been achieved by increasing the wheelbase by 200mm. The interior of this most elegant of coachbuilt Astons, as ever, is a symphony of Connolly leather, walnut veneer, wall to wall Wilton and cold chrome details. Thinking about it, the long chassis is the last Aston ever to feature masses of polished walnut veneer. The shape of the instrument panel became more rounded over the centre console; it was similar to the in overall shape, but with the incidental dials arraigned in a 2 + 2 fashion. Also two DIN slots were provided for a tape player linked to a CD multi-changer hidden in the dashboard and also an optional sat-nav system with flip out screen.\n\nThe double lined roof was of course fully electric and operated completely automatically with no levers or catches to unfasten. When folded, it stands quite proud of the boot lid and can be covered by a leather tonneau cover.\n\nThe UK list price without extras but including VAT was a huge £169,500 without extras. With such a high price it’s not surprising that a mere 63 examples were constructed, most were sold outside of the UK even though the car was never marketed in North America. With more passenger space and a substantial boot, the LWB has a reputation as a genuinely practical continental touring car.\n\nCars such as the long chassis Volante will never be built again by Aston Martin. A very rare and desirable car which is gaining in popularity by collectors and enthusiasts.\n\nThis is one of a pair of the Aston Martin V8s, the other one is identical in coachwork colour and interior trim but the Coupe version, a his and hers classic pair.\n\n1998 Aston Martin V8 Volante LWB Automatic, in Rolls Royce Garnet Black with Sandstone piped with Wild berry hide, Wild Berry carpets and over mats, Black Mohair hood with Parchment Alcantara headlining, reversing sensors, Alpine tape/CD/radio,\n\n1 owner from new, supplied and maintained by ourselves with mileage recorded as 21902\n\nPrice £179,000"}

Orange with Black interior. 21,163 miles on the clock. The car has just come out of long-term storage, where it’s been since it fell out of daily use about 30 years ago. It has rust in all the usual Midget places and is therefore being sold as a restoration project. The doors look surprisingly good so I think they were probably replaced at some point. The car had a lot of money spent on it in it’s day and has some very nice upgrades including: a duck hood, electronic ignition, electric fan, oil cooler, alloy rocker cover, alloy air cleaner, Spax shocks, 4 branch manifold, custom armrest cubby and a centre console with oil pressure gauge, voltmeter and clock. The engine turns over by hand but I haven’t made any attempt to actually start it. It will no doubt need a bit of tinkering and some fresh fuel etc to get it going again. The previous owner told me he had it converted for unleaded and it has a stage 2 head although I don’t have any paperwork to support that. Overall, I’d say that this is a very original and most importantly complete Midget which would make a great project for someone. Very realistically priced to reflect the condition and for a quick sale but I’ll consider a sensible offer, preferably from someone who has viewed it in person. Rolls easily for loading and I have the current V5. Sensible questions and viewings welcome. I’m located close to Chichester on the South Coast."}

They also bought out a new 'flagship' model, the ES.ES models were fitted with ABS brakes, Air Conditioning (working and cold on this one), full leather trim, pewter alloys (shod on this one with a matching set of 4 Pirelli Scorpion tyres), electric twin sunroofs, electric seats, windows etc, plus a few other extras like roof rails. When we were offered this one by a long-standing client and serious Land Rover enthusiast, what really piqued my interest, apart from the condition, was the 'VC' number plate, as this usually signifies a factory car. A glance at the original service book confirms the original registered keeper as Land Rover, Lode Lane, Solihull. My interest increased when I found it's specification was a little different to other ES models, in that it isn't fitted with electric seats or electric sunroofs. Neither are any great loss as the electrics usually play up or fail on the seats and roof. It's possible it was an early production evaluation example, or possibly one originally intended for a RHD market outside of the UK, that the factory decided to retain. It's also fitted with full-length side steps, adjustable towpack, and inside it has the original stereo system, and a dog guard in place of the luggage blind. Also fitted with Terrafirma springs and shock absorbers all round. Odometer reading 109000 miles supported by the original service book with details of 17 services, and a selection of bills. It switches seamlessly from petrol to LPG once it's warmed up, drives really well, and sounds superb. You can't beat a V8 in my opinion. It comes with MOT to 30th March 2024,  and 6 months warranty on sale\n\nIt’s obviously been very well looked after by previous owners, and it’s a pretty rare beast these days, needing a new owner that will keep it in the manner to which it’s accustomed!\n\nAt the very bottom of the page, you’ll find our usual 2 videos, which form part of the description.

{"name": "1974 BMW 2002 TURBO - €99,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "First publicly sold vehicle that was turbocharged, meanwhile the entire world suffered from the 1973 oil crisis, showing off BMW’s rebellion\nReal racetrack and rally car\nSpacious sports car that fits four people\nMust-have for any collector\n \n\nThe BMW 2002 - also known as BMW E10 - is by far the best-known model in the series 02. When releasing the 02, BMW aimed to reach a wide audience that wanted both sporty performance, space and comfort for a good price. The series 02 - especially the 2002 - became very popular in rally racing, further proving that German production cars are unmistakably distinguishing compared to cars with another ethnicity. Given its relatively long production period, from 1966 to 1977, and its influence on the highly acclaimed and well-known BMW series 3, the 02 is a must-have collector’s item for classic car enthusiasts.\n\nIt was in 1966 that BMW presented the 1600-2 at the Geneva Motor Show. It had to be the successor to the BMW sedan \"Neue Klasse\" (German for New Class) 1600. The 1600-2 was the sportier coupe with of course two doors instead of four. The name was soon given a new look: 1602, with the first two digits indicating the engine capacity and the last two digits indicating the series’ name 02. The 1602 was equipped with the BMW M10 engine, which is BMW's first four-cylinder engine since 1932 and delivered 85 horsepower.\n\nThe success of the 1602 didn’t remain unnoticed, and in response BMW decided to expand its range. In 1968, the BMW 2002 was introduced, which is a faster 02 with a larger engine that was powered by two Solex carburettors, which would later be replaced by mechanical injection. By introducing the BMW 1802 in 1971, BMW had chosen the golden mean: the 1802 was a 1766 cc engine car that was built to avoid the difficult buyer’s option between the 2002 and the 1602. Over the years, the 2002 was, reworked and improved, which made it able to prove its capacities on the rally circuit, for which it is still often used today. It was also the first production car with a turbo in 1974. As the icing on the cake, the 1502 was introduced in 1975, which is a smaller version of the 1602 that was meant to usher in the end of the 02’s era. Production was discontinued in 1977, partly due to the arrival of the series 3 as its successor. Ultimately, just over 800,000 02-series cars were delivered.\n\nThe BMW series 02 remains a highly coveted and sought-after classic. Thanks to its role as a precursor to the series 3, the catchy comfort-and-sport mix, and proof that regular BMW production cars could outdo rally cars in their own habitat.\n\nBMW 2002 Turbo\n\nIn 1973, BMW unveiled its 2002 Turbo. At first glance, this car appears to be an anachronism, oil rates were skyrocketing worldwide, as the 1973 oil embargo had just been put. Many feared the worst and therefore even speed limits were lowered on highways. Nevertheless, BMW boldly released a sports car to the market, and not just any sports car, one that would shape the future of automotive design. The 2002 Turbo was the first European production car to be turbocharged for increased power output.\n\nThe car's performance was mind-blowing for its time. Additionally, the BMW story that this car carries is what makes classic car enthusiasts drool over. As there’s only about 1,700 manufactured from 1973 to 1975, its value appears to be truly on the rise.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 422 (166 inch)\nWidth (cm): 163 (64 inch)\nHeight (cm): 141 (56 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 250 (98 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1080 (2381 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: straight-four turbocharged 1990 cc front-engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: Kugelfischer P04 fuel injection\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 168 hp (125 kW) at 5800 t/m\ntorque: 245 Nm at 4000 t/m\nTop speed: 211 km/h (131 mph)"}

{"name": "1990 FERRARI TESTAROSSA F110 - €149,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Initially Italian vehicle with Italian MOT, thus it’s ‘a real Ferrari’\nF110 is the internal Ferrari’s reference for the Testarossa\n \n\nThe Ferrari Testarossa was presented at the Paris Auto Show in 1984. Its name was derived from two earlier successful Ferrari racing cars of the 250 series. At the time, it was the production car with the most powerful engine on the market and noticeably only superlatives can do it justice. Sales had been successful - by Ferrari standards, not in millions - though production stopped in 1992, with a total of approximately 7.200 units produced.\n\nThis luxurious sports car was designed by the famous design company Pininfarina, who are based in Turin. It is fair to say that they made this Ferrari a true icon. Regulation in various countries did not allow for large air sucking holes to be built into a car. Pininfarina decided to design air ‘slots’ on the doors of the car. These air slots are nicknamed ‘egg slicers’ and provide the V12 engine with enough oxygen to burn fuel and convert it to Italian horsepower, real horsepower. Initially regular air intakes were designed, but those seem to break the laws in some countries. Thanks to the iconic design of these vents, the Testarossa deserved starring roles in famous TV series like Miami Vice. Rumour has it that famous people such as Elton John, Rod Stewart, and Michael Jordan have one in their garage.\n\nUnder the hood of the Testarossa is an unbelievably high-performance V12 engine of 4943 cc which produces 385 horsepower and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0-60 mph) in less than six seconds. Four valves per cylinder give the power a boost, for a total of 48 valves, which was also ground-breaking at the time. The 48-valve engine is controlled by a manual five-speed gearbox, which creates a driving experience that is typical to Ferrari.\n\nTestarossa is Italian for ‘redhead’ and refers to the similarly named Ferrari racing cars of the 1950s and 1960s, whose names referred to the red painted cylinder heads. Over the years, a few minor adjustments were made to the car. In 1986 and in response to customer demand, a right-hand mirror was installed, as it was not originally present. In 1991, Ferrari unofficially decided to stop production of the Testarossa. The successor would be the 512TR - TR still meaning Testarossa - and was essentially an upgraded Testarossa.\n\nThe Testarossa is a car that only superlatives can describe. It has set the tone for further Ferrari cars and had – at the time – the most powerful engine to be ever made for a production car. This, and its appearance in numerous tv series, make it a very coveted classic among car aficionados.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 449 (177 inch)\nWidth (cm): 198 (78 inch)\nHeight (cm): 113 (44 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 255 (100 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1506 (3320 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 4943 cc flat V12 rear-engine\nValve gear: 48, DOHC\nFuel system: Bosch K-Jetronic\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 376 hp (280 kW) at 5750 t/m\ntorque: 470 Nm at 4500 t/m\nTop speed: 290 km/h (180 mph)"}

In the 70s, the A110 became famous and glorious in rally world due to its light weight and powerful engine. When revealing the A110, Alpine had been building cars for almost a decade. It all started with Jean Redele, a French Renault dealer that built a car for Renault car parts, he named it the A106, Alpine was born.\n\nThe A110  was introduced at the 1962 Paris Motor Show as the successor to the A108. It quickly became clear that it was more of a racing car than a passenger car, so private sales progressed just slowly. However, the A110 began to have notable success in rally racing. Alpine noticed this and decided to get focused on rallying, which proved to be the right decision. In the 70s, the A110 became a rally legend. In 1971, an A110 even won the Rallye Monte Carlo, besides numerous other races\n\nOver the years, Alpine continued to experiment with the mechanical capabilities and possibilities of the A110. Therefore, the car was equipped with a range of different engines, which were produced in various locations, including Mexico, Bulgaria, Spain, and of course in Alpine’s birthplace of Dieppe, France.\n\nProduction stopped in 1977, around 7500 models had been produced. Since 2017, Alpine has been selling an eponymous - though also very similar - car as a tribute.\n\nAlpine A110 1600S\n\nThe A110 1600S is the A110 version that truly set the A110's reputation as a rally car. It was manufactured from 1970 to 1973 and, different from other A110’s, it featured a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that was lent from Renault. Combined with its light weight, it truly stood out on the circuit, winning the Monte Carlo rally in 1971, achieving consecutive victories in international rally races between automakers from 1970 to 1972 and even making Alpine the first rally world champion ever in 1973.\n\nThe 1600S is a conversation piece, that has set a tone for Alpine and Renault’s sports cars, making it a real collector’s item. For this reason, it is highly sought after classic car.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 385 (152 inch)\nWidth (cm): 155 (61 inch)\nHeight (cm): 112 (44 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 213 (84 inch)\nWeight (kg): 690 (1521 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 1565 cc four-cylinder rear-engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: 2 Weber carburettors\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 136 hp (100 kW) at 6000 t/m\ntorque: 144 Nm at 5000 t/m\nTop speed: 215 km/h (134 mph)"}

Dealer Accessories; Blaupunkt Verona CR31 radio/cassette, Kenwood 104B speakers, cassette storage system, Mercedes-Benz over-mats. \n\nEXTERIOR\nThis stunning cosseted example is finished in factory original Mercedes Benz Light Ivory, (Code 623), a truly iconic colour.  The paintwork boasts a stunning high gloss uniform finish and perfect linear gaps to the factory panels thanks to garage storage from new.  The original body panels and paintwork have been meticulously preserved to an exceptional level and the only imperfections worthy of mention are a few tiny touched in paint chips to the lower edge of the driver’s door.  All trim, glass, lights and badges are damage free and the original supplying dealer number plates remain fitted to the vehicle.  A wonderful example of an iconic Mercedes-Benz saloon from the heyday of the marques build quality.          \n\nINTERIOR \nThe envy of its competitors both ergonomically and in the quality of materials is the Mercedes-Benz W201.  The highest-grade materials and first-class workmanship can be felt in every feature from the positively contoured seats trimmed in factory optional Light Tan full leather, (Code 174), to the precision made and fully functional switchgear.  The spotless upholstery to the seats and door cards remains in pristine condition and all carpeting has been immaculately protected with Mercedes-Benz over mats from new.  The dashboard and switchgear are totally unworn and the gauge needles are bright orange thanks to indoor storage and protection from UV rays.  The boot area is clean with the original tool roll, jack and warning triangle correctly stored.  The unopened first aid kit and genuine MB paintwork touch-up pen are stored in the rear parcel shelf compartment.  The dealer fitted Blaupunkt Verona CR31 radio/cassette operates well.

Displacing 1996cc and producing 122bhp, a top speed of 119mph and 0-62mph time of 11.5 seconds is quietly and comfortably achieved.  The engine bay is beautifully clean and displays factory labels, VIN tag and build data plate.  The optional four-speed automatic transmission is effortless and delivers a beautifully smooth and relaxed driving manner.\n\nWHEELS, TYRES & BRAKES\nFactory standard 15” light alloy wheels with the eight-hole design are in near perfect condition with no curb damage and only tiny scratches around some of the wheel stud holes, barely visible.  The Mercedes three-pointed star centre caps are perfect.  Quality matching Barum (by Continental) 185/65 R15 tyres have ample tread remaining and the spare wheel remains shod in the factory fitted Michelin MXV rubber which has never been used.  Dual-circuit power brakes with anti-lock (ABS) assistance bring the car up to a straight and steady halt.\n\nHISTORY FILE\nFull Mercedes-Benz Main dealer and marque specialist service history and only 79,699 miles from new with two owners, this example has been beautifully kept in every aspect.

With just one owner showing on V5 (due to computerisation 1978), this car was first supplied to Mr P. F. Butler in Leeds in March 1959. It has race history from Wiscombe Park in Devon in 1962. The second owner was World War II Spitfire flying ace “Woody” Woodward of Tewkesbury, Glos. The last owner acquired the car as a student in 1970 and his love for it meant he managed to keep hold of it. In 2009 the car went through a lengthy, costly and extremely sympathetic restoration. Every invoice is present in the huge history file, many from AML, and Aston Services Dorset. This car has been in single careful ownership for over 50 years, which might explain the incredible originality and superb preservation of many original parts. We have thoroughly inspected this car and it has been serviced and prepared for use. The level of detail is impressive and it would be very difficult to find a better example. However -  there are 2 tiny dings in the paintwork – one in the RH rear wing and one in the left front of the bonnet. The DB Mk3 is the original ‘Bond car’ as featured in the Ian Fleming spy thriller novels, this was a true supercar in in 1959. Key features are: -Original equipment DBD specification engine. -Genuine numbers matching car in original colours inside and out. -This car retains it’s original windows with matching coded “kite” marks. -Beautiful patination of many original parts such as windows chrome trims and never-seen original boot floor mat. -Car is unmodified and quite literally in as-new condition, The door shut areas and panels are in wonderful condition, please see photos.

{"name": "2012 TOYOTA FJ CRUISER - £27,950 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "ULEZ Compliant\nAustralian import\nAutomatic transmission\nAir conditioned\nOnly 53,500 miles from new\nA tribute to the classic FJ40 Land Cruiser\nRare RHD example\nAn excellent off roader\nThe Toyota FJ Cruiser is one of the most recognisable modern Toyotas. This rugged machine brought a generous dose of style to the off-road world when it was launched in North America and later around the world (but sadly not in the UK) from 2006.\n\nThe exterior design by Toyota’s Calty Design Research studio in Newport Beach, California, paid tribute to the classic FJ40 Land Cruiser that has a huge cult following around the world. When the concept was unveiled at the 2003 Detroit Motor Show, reaction was so positive that Toyota decided to put the FJ Cruiser into production.\n\nWhen the production model went on sale three years after the concept was first shown, the SUV’s characterful styling remained remarkably faithful to the concept vehicle, including the distinctive, thick side pillar behind those truncated rear doors, which opened rearwards for access to the back seats. The FJ Cruiser’s short-wheelbase, ladder-frame chassis was based on the one used in the 120-Series Land Cruiser Prado with power from a dependable, 4-litre V6.\n\nToyota wanted serious off-road performance from the FJ Cruiser, so it tested the car on demanding trails like the Rubicon that are popular with US off-road enthusiasts. An active traction control system, low-range transfer case, electronic-locking rear differential and a high crawl ratio with the manual transmission option all help keep you moving on the trail. Not all FJs were 4WD, though: a RWD option was popular with customers who preferred their vehicles to be more Cruiser than FJ.\n\nThe FJ’s interior is adapted to the go-anywhere brief with ventilated, water-repellent seats and easy-to-clean surfaces. The seats are upholstered with a fabric backed by a special breathable resin coating, which helps them to shed liquids so that they can be easily wiped down. Liquids are prevented from penetrating the stitched seams by a sealant. Meanwhile the floor surfaces are covered with a grey, rubber-like material for easy cleaning.\n\nThe FJ Cruiser has three wipers for the windscreen. The three wiper arms cover almost the entirety of the wide, near-vertical front screen, so you’ll always be able to see a path through the mud, sand or river washing over the bonnet. Many owners fit an intake snorkel and diff/transmission breathers to go even deeper than the standard wading depth.\n\nThe car picked up resale value awards during its time on sale Stateside, but its reputation has grown further since and used prices are as solid as ever. One factor could be relatively modest new sales: more than 200,000 were sold in the US over eight years, but more than half of those came in the first two years on sale, before the global financial crisis took its toll from 2008.\n\nFJ Cruisers were never sold new by Toyota in the UK, but dozens are on the roads today thanks to personal imports. Right-hand-drive cars are extremely rare.\n\nNow available for viewing at the DD Classics Dealership in London, please call 0208 878 33 55 to book an appointment.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the above information but errors may occur. Please check with a salesperson."}

No expense spared restoration. 2.0 High Torque Ivor Searle engine producing 115 bhp. Very rare, highly collectable car with heritage certificate. Introduced in 1979 to celebrate 50 years of MG production at Abingdon, the Limited Edition (LE) models were the last to be built there before the factory’s closure in October 1980. Finished in Bronze Metallic and sporting a chin spoiler, Triumph Stag-type alloy wheels and a unique LE livery. In 2005/06 the car was subject to a complete overhaul with a continuation of further improvements since. The car has only covered 5000 miles since it's return to the road in 2006. It would seem that every conceivable part has been overhauled or renewed between then and now. The engine was sent to Ivor Searle for a 2.0 High Torque upgrade (full spec sheet available upon request). Tuned and tested this engine and can confirm a very healthy output of 115 bhp (120 lb ft of torque), an increase of around 25 percent in power but still maintaining every once of driveability. The brakes, suspension and engine cooling have been upgraded to cope with these increase without spoiling the originality of the car. This car has been rebuilt and maintained with such attention to detail it really needs to be seen in the flesh to be believed. I started to add up the cost of the rebuild not including the 100’s of man hours, thought and attention with the costs quickly exceeding the now advertised price. Altogether this car is absolutely ready to go and will appeal to the classic car enthusiast and or collector that does not have the will, time or health to tinker, just jump in and enjoy. I would gladly take it anywhere and with the on going maintenance and care it deserves is sure to be a sound investment for the future."}

Work started in 1972 under a joint agreement between Daimler-Benz and Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Graz, Austria, with production of a civilian version beginning in 1979. The vehicle was manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) and sold by Mercedes-Benz.\n\nVery much in the style of a Land Rover-type cross-country vehicle, with utilitarian appearance; body-on-frame construction and four-wheel drive with fully locking differentials, the G-Class has achieved a great reputation for durability and reliability. It remains in production and is one of the longest-running series in M-B's history. Over the years it has received several revisions and been available in many body variants with numerous engine options. Whilst the more basic military use has continued, the civilian versions have generally become more powerful, luxurious and sophisticated. \n\nThis short wheelbase, 2-door convertible variant – a first series W460 model - was first registered in 1987 and supplied to the Singapore Army, so is both right hand drive and in a full military camouflage finish. We know little of its military service – other than it has not seen a great deal of use and assume it would have been regularly and carefully maintained. Sold off as ‘Army surplus’, it was imported to, and re-registered, in the UK in March 2023, before moving to Jersey just a couple of months later.\n\nThe G-Wagen is powered by the 240D 4-cylinder diesel engine, driving through a 4-speed manual gearbox. This engine is rated for an output of 71 bhp at 4,400 rpm and has a claimed 71 mph top speed. All works as it should with 4-wheel drive available for forays into the countryside.\n\nThe bodywork is in very good condition and shows no signs of hard use or damage in service. The G-Wagen still sports a number of military fixtures – tailgate legs, Jerry can holder, towing hook etc. - but the gun has been removed! The chassis and underside of the vehicle as a whole are in good condition having clearly been extensively undersealed for protection.\n\nBest described as ‘spartan’, this is not a vehicle that pampers its driver or passengers, but everything is there and in good condition. The 4 vinyl-covered seats are fully weatherproof and equipped with seatbelts (the rear seats fold away). The canvas roof (which can be removed) fully covers the driver’s area, but only offers a little protection to rear seat passengers. \n\nThis is a rugged and truly practical classic off-road, utility vehicle. It is in a very good overall condition and drives well.\n\nThe car is currently Jersey registered and we can assist with shipping and importing processes if required, but any import duties and transport costs would be additional to the price listed."}

Was this audaciously styled car, its lines reminiscent of the Continental sports saloons of the past, really worth almost twice as much as the Silver Shadow on which it was based? The company's flagship, the Camargue was priced at 50 percent above the Corniche and used an up-rated version of Rolls-Royce's dependable, 6,750cc pushrod V8 engine. In keeping with tradition the power output remained undisclosed but most testers reported a healthy improvement in acceleration above 70mph and a top speed in excess of 120mph. The Camargue was introduced with Rolls-Royce's advanced split-level air conditioning system which later became standard on the Shadow II range. The interior remained the traditional 'Gentlemen's Club on Wheels', with acres of walnut embellishment and the finest-quality leather. The Camargue and Corniche were also the first to feature Rolls' revised rear suspension and ride height control.\n\nThe Camargues production was shared between Mulliner, Park Ward in London and the Crewe factory for the first few years before being concentrated at the latter plant from 1978. It was produced at the rate of around one car per week, the Camargue was an exclusive model even by Rolls-Royce standards with only 531 units produced by the time production ended in 1986. When finished a Camargue would cost ~£83,122 or close to £249,000 at today's prices!\n\nNow available for viewing at the DD Classics Dealership in London, please call 0208 878 33 55 to book an appointment."}

The series was built from 1968 to 2019, and the abbreviation stands for ‘experimental Jaguar’, which explains much of the cars’ uniqueness. Over the decades, the XJ series had a range of different model codes and names, often based on the splendid engine configuration. In addition to offering ‘ordinary luxury’, Jaguar decided to offer ‘supreme luxury’ under its subsidiary brand, Daimler.\n\nJaguar XJ Mk IV – X351\n\nThe Jaguar XJ Mk IV, also known by its internal reference ‘X351’, represented a futurization from its predecessor in series, the more classic and even somewhat antiquated XJ Mk III X350. It was manufactured from 2009 to 2019 and served as Jaguar's swan song to the XJ series, although initially there were plans for an electric XJ to enter the market.\n\nBy modern standards, the X351 boasts an array of sophistication. Under the hood of this luxury car, there are various high-performance engines available, catering to different customer preferences. These include a turbocharged V6 engine with a displacement of three litres, a five-litre V8, and the same V8 engine with a supercharger. There's also a very fuel-economical three-litre V6 diesel engine. Each of these engines holds its ground impressively, as Jaguar ensures no disappointment, and all variants are electronically limited to a top speed of 250 kilometres per hour or 155 miles per hour.\n\nAs mentioned, the X351 introduced a lot of new features. The car's frame is made of lightweight aluminium, half of which is composed of recycled materials. In terms of luxury, the vehicle features a touchscreen, a built-in GPS, ergonomic leather seats, ample legroom, and steering wheel controls. The X351 is the quintessential long-distance cruiser, seemingly tailor-made for the average dignitary. British politicians like Margaret Thatcher, David Cameron, and Theresa May chose wisely for the X351 to get transported in.\n\nProduction of the XJ Mk IV continued until 2019, but the earlier announced electric XJ never came to be built. The X351 embodies the classic Jaguar spirit with the flair of a British icon.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 512 (202 inch)\nWidth (cm): 189 (74 inch)\nHeight (cm): 145 (57 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 303 (119 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1871 (4125 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: turbocharged 2993 cc V6 diesel front-engine\nValve gear: 24\nAspiration: turbocharged with intercooler\nGear box: 6-speed automatic\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 271 hp (202 kW) at 4000 t/m\ntorque: 600 Nm at 2000 t/m\nTop speed: 250 km/h (155 mph)"}

Bought earlier this year for my daughters wedding and she performed faultless both getting the bride to the church and on time. Registered in December 1932 to AJ Cole from Burnham in Essex the V5 is showing 8 previous owners, the most notable in 1997 to John Saunders who was the founder of the Stondon Motor Museum. The car was fully Black at this point and it remained in the museum until 2015 when the museum closed. The new owner then commissioned restoration work on the car and at this time the colour was changed to Black over Green, an original colour combination for the era of car and one which looks stunning on this little Minor. The car was sold at Mathewson's in June 2022 for a final price of £7500 when the new owner refreshed the car ensuring everything worked as it should. I bought the car to use for my daughters wedding, this car by far the best of any that I viewed at the time. Not only has the car been used for the wedding but also for regular drives out over the Summer. Both internal and external this car is in great condition, anyone viewing would not be disappointed.

It is reported the TR6 was restored during the mid 1990’s using all original Stanparts panels which were still available at that time. A well-documented history file also shows the car has been consistently on the road for much of the last 40 years and has covered around 12000 miles since the mid 1990’s and since 1982 (according to MOT records), 17000 miles have been covered.\nMPH 126L is in beautiful condition and is further enhanced with some lovely upgrades. The TR boasts an unleaded cylinder head, uprated Spax shock absorbers all round, poly bushes suspension and steering rack, stainless steel exhaust system, upgraded drive shafts and hubs, uprated fuel injector pump, and has recently been fitted with a set of Minilight style road wheels and new tyres. Recent work also includes a new water pump, hoses and front brake calipers. On the road the TR6 is excellent with impressive power and performance from its 150BHP fuel injected six cylinder engine. Overdrive works on 2nd, 3rd and 4th, the gear changes are smooth and with its poly bushes suspension and the car rides superbly and feels tight on the road. Whilst the car has had a high quality restoration, maintenance invoices are on file throughout the 1980's onwards demonstrating a good level of upkeep.\n\nThe TR6 presents superbly with an excellent straight bodyshell and lovely consistent paintwork. The car is nicely detailed with a smart under bonnet, brightwork and rubbers are all very smart throughout and the TR looks great with its Minilight style wheels, mohair hood and boot rack. The interior is excellent with lovely seats, carpets, door cards, dashboard and dials. The car presents as one you'd expect to see on the local show circuit, its clean, sharp and beautifully presented throughout. MPH 126L is an example ideal for regular use and will not disappoint."}

{"name": "1995 MG RV8 - £22,950 ", "transmission": " 5-SPEED MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The MG RV8 was first exhibited at the NEC British Motor Show in October 1992, with the first production models sold in early 1993. Whilst this was 13 years after the last MGB model had been produced, British Motor Heritage were manufacturing new MGB bodyshells to meet demand from the MGB restoration market. The Rover Group (then owners of British Motor Heritage) was planning to launch a modern sports car at the time and so the RV8 came into being – using the newly made MGB bodyshell as the basis.\n\nThe modifications made included mildly flared wings and a subtly re-shaped nose with better aerodynamics. The interior was treated to a substantial upgrade with leather and veneer trim, but the biggest change was under the bonnet, where a 3.9 litre, fuel injected V8 engine was placed, giving the car a claimed 190bhp @ 4750rpm. Driving through a 5-speed gearbox, this gave a top speed of 136mph and 0-60mph time of 6.9 seconds. Considerably more performance than an MGB and faster than the original MGB GT V8. There had not been a factory-built V8-engined MGB Roadster previously, so the new RV8 had a niche of its own. \n\nThe model was manufactured for just 3 years, with 1,982 having been made by November 1995 when production ended. The RV8 was immensely popular in Japan and more than 1,500 were exported there. Many have since returned to the UK and the car offered here is one such, having been re-imported in 2004. It was subsequently purchased by a Guernsey resident and re-registered in the island in 2017. Much work has since been undertaken to return the car to a first-class condition and keep it in very good running order.\n\nMechanically, the car benefits from the addition of EZ electric power steering and a stainless steel exhaust system. The current owner has spent considerable effort in getting this car into A1 condition and keeping it that way. It runs and drives very well. \n\nThe underside and engine bay of this MG are in a very clean, solid condition. The body is unmarked and the paintwork gleams – testament to the care lavished on the car. The alloy wheels are equally well finished, as is the folding hood. The luxurious interior in beige leather and burr-elm wood trim is in excellent condition and wants for nothing. A very smart RV8. \n\nWith less than 2,000 manufactured, this is a rare opportunity to acquire a traditional-style, open-topped British sportscar. This particular RV8 has been very well looked after – kept garaged and not used in the rain - since re-importation from Japan. It has accumulated a low mileage (the original kmph speedometer was replaced on return to the UK) of a little over 35,000 in total, which is reflected in its excellent overall condition. \n\nThe car is currently Guernsey registered and we can assist with shipping and importation processes if required. We can ship worldwide."}

A range of models was offered during the 18 year life of the 107, with the new 5 litre being launched in 1980, which was enhanced over the next 5 years culminating in the last year of manufacture in 1989, with the 5.6 litre 560 SL as for sale here. \nThe 560 SL carried a big, 5.6-liter V-8 under its long bonnet. The single-overhead-cam, fuel-injected engine produced 227 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 287 foot-pounds of torque at 3,500 rpm. Power was directed to the rear wheels by a four-speed automatic transmission. The 560 SL could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in approximately 8 seconds, which was reasonably quick in its day, and had a top speed of about 140 mph. The SL employed disc brakes with ABS at all four corners, which was not yet common in the late 1980s. The car had a double-wishbone front suspension and a diagonal axle setup in the rear. A traditional recirculating-ball steering system was used, rather than the more-modern rack-and-pinion type.

{"name": "1971 FERRARI 365 GTB/4 - £475,000 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Our Daytona was purchased new from Maranello Concessionaires Ltd in July 1972 for £10,072 by D. Dobbie, Perth, Scotland.  It was then sold to rock music legend Sir Elton John.   Sir Elton enjoyed owning the Daytona for two years before re-selling it.  The Daytona retains much of its original factory features, is numbers matching, and is presented in excellent condition.\n\nThoroughbred and Classics Cars magazine later wrote about the car, “Had this dream come true in, say 1972, I’d have been the proud owner of a Ferrari 365 GTB/4.  With its front-mounted V12 engine powering the rear wheels and clothed in suitably stunning steel, the Daytona is to many the ultimate Ferrari GT, the final incarnation of a bloodline that stretched back via the 275 and 250 to Enzo Ferrari’s first road cars.”  \n\nAlthough a Pininfarina design, as with many previous Ferrari road cars styled by Leonardo Fioravanti, the 365 GTB/4 was radically different, replacing the traditional rounded design with much more sharp-edged styling.  All bodies except the first Pininfarina prototype were produced by Italian coachbuilder Scaglietti, which already had a well-established record of working with Ferrari. The magazine continued, “It’s diabolically beautiful, with stupefying proportions, that pin down the aesthetic senses, only for its deft and subtle detailing to coax them back…  You’re left in no doubt that this was Ferrari’s ultimate expression of front-engined potency and performance. It has all the classic cues.  The bonnet stretches endlessly with the cabin crouching behind it, submitting to the airstream with carefree bravado and, like a great work of art, the Daytona’s apparent simplicity is deceptive.

At the workshop on Abingdon Road in Kensignton, the first registered car was built in 1915.When choosing the name of the car, they came up with the name \"Aston Martin\" - a combination of Aston Hills and the surname of co-founder Lionel Martin.The name \"Vantage\" is very important to Aston Martin. In the 60s, 70s and 80s, it was the name of the extra strong and fast variant of the DB4 and the V8. We also encountered the name with the forerunner of the \"Vanquish\": the \"Project Vantage Concept\".            In 2005, the new \"Vantage V8\" was launched, a coupé with a six-speed manual transmission. The Roadster was available from 2007. The 4.3 V8 engine was from Jaguar. Unlike the Jaguar engines, this engine was completely modified and assembled by hand.The car was to be seen as a direct competitor to the Porsche 911 and therefore offered identical performance, although the \"V8 Vantage\" was much more luxurious and exclusive and, above all, sounded much better of course!\n\nTechnical data\n\nBodywork: convertible\n\nLength (cm): 438.2\n\nWidth (cm) : 186.6\n\nHeight (cm) : 126.5\n\nWheelbase (cm) : 260.0\n\nWeight (kg) : 1710\n\nMechanics\n\nEngine : V8 4280 cc front\n\nValves : 32\n\nPetrol system : multipoint injection\n\nGear box : 6 manual\n\nTransmission : rear wheels\n\nLeft-hand drive\n\nMaximum power : 380 hp (283 kW) at 7300 t/m\n\nMaximum torque : 410 Nm at 5000 t/m\n\nTop speed : 280 km/h"}

{"name": "1995 ROLLS ROYCE SILVER DAWN - £37,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This is a truly first class, low mileage example of the highly desirable late flagship model. Not only has this outstanding car only covered 35,000 miles from new with a wonderful full history, it spent the first seven months with Rolls Royce at Crewe, reportedly for the use of one of the Rolls Royce Directors, and has since had two further owners. This Diamond Blue with Parchment trim 1997 model year car was first registered on the 10th July 1996, and the chassis denotes this to be the first chassis number (59001) for the 1997 model year and was then registered to Rolls Royce. The car came with an high specification to include electric front and rear seats with heating and four stage memory fronts, front telephone, picnic tables to the rear, rich burr walnut capping’s with crossbrand inlays, electric mirrors, cruise control, air-conditioning, outside temperature gauge and lambswool rugs and footstools to the rear.\nWith only 237 built in total, and we are told less than 100 RHD models, these cars are rare making this example something very special. The Rolls Royce comes with its original service books, manuals, spare keys and a comprehensive file of history demonstrating top quality maintenance throughout its life. S.P Broughton & Company looked after the car in its early life with services at 7532, 8849, 10486, 10831 and 11482 miles. A Bristol based garage began maintenance from 2000 with service stamped at 12156, 14566, 16668, 18385, 19780, 22301, 23140, 23919 and 24535 miles. In 2016 Rolls Royce and prestige car specialist Derek C Mowat serviced the car at 26795 miles when supplying the car to the most recent owner. Since arriving in Yorkshire in 2016, Shadow Services of Leeds serviced the car at 28712, 30758, 31709 miles, and most recently at 32739 miles Prestige Services of Leeds serviced the Rolls Royce.\n\nSince 2016, the recent owner has maintained the car with no expense spared. Invoices total in the region of £12,000, £3000 alone with Bentley Leeds in 2017 for new Avon tyres, adjusted wheel bearings, new battery, new park brake pads and front brake pads. A health check was also carried out with Bentley. Further expenditure was for general servicing, maintenance and upkeep with Rolls Royce specialists, but due to an intermittent fault with the gearbox, in 2021 the car went to automatic transmission specialist Martin Lowe for rebuilding the automatic transmission and torque converter. The car has clearly had no expense spared, and having spent the winter and early Spring in storage, the Rolls Royce has been MOT tested and then driven faultlessly over to us.\n\nThis is a beautiful motor car, the paintwork is of a first class standard and the bodywork beautiful throughout. Externally the car is very impressive, and it does not disappoint under the bonnet, and the upholstery is quite simply exceptional. The leather, burr walnut, carpets are all of a magnificent standard, and the general feel of the car is of a top class, beautifully maintained low mileage example. On the road the car is effortless, it performs perfectly with wonderful handling and performance, and offers a comfortable, smoothy and incredibly luxurious experience. This is a collectors piece and will be difficult to repeat.\nDue in shortly."}

{"name": "1973 JENSEN SP - £79,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Jensen SP with its Six-Pack carburettor system was launched onto the market in 1971 as the Company’s new flagship car. Today these cars are rare, only 232 SP models were produced and the SP was to be the fastest, most powerful model offered by the West Bromwich manufacturers. HON 9L is a special car in its own right, its covered just 29500 miles from new and has recently been subject of a £35,000 re-commissioning program of work that also included some cosmetic re-finishing.\nHON 9L was supplied new by Philip Mist (Automobiles) Ltd in Handsworth, Birmingham to Francis Williams Oil Co Ltd of Bristol Street, Birmingham on the 18th April 1973 and the production card with the car confirms it was supplied in Pacific Blue with Beige trim, as it presents today. The Jensen carried out most of its mileage in its first ten years, its first services are recorded at 1291 and 3805 miles and in 1974 at 12294 miles the SP was back with Jensen for some warranty work, all of which is detailed within the history file. Having spent its very early life in the Midlands, in 1982 the SP headed north with around 29000 miles covered from new within the nine years, but after only one year it was placed in storage, and not put back on the road until 2021.\n\nThe Jensen came out of storage in 2018 and sold to its most recent in Harrogate. During the summer of 2018, a re-commissioning and light restoration program was started on what was an incredibly original car. The Jensen was stripped to a rolling shell, windscreens removed and areas of corrosion were cut out and replaced with new panels to include a front wing repair sections, new lower door bottom sections, rear wheel arch panel, inner and outer sills, inner and outer valances and complete front panel. The Jensen shell was then prepared for a re-paint in its original colour, and then built up with renewed chrome work, new rubbers, trims, gaskets seals and tread plates. The Jensen interior was then fully cleaned, treated and a new set of wool carpets fitted to the car.\n\nHON 9L has covered very little mileage since completion and as result, presents in excellent condition throughout. Mechanically the SP is impressive with a strong, fit ultra-low mileage 7.2 V8 engine offering fantastic performance. No doubt due to the time off the road, the automatic gearbox was not functioning correctly so was removed from the car in 2022 and rebuilt, and the brakes overhauled as necessary. As result, this SP is excellent to drive and feels sharp, precise and offers an incredibly enjoyable driving experience. With just 29,500 miles, this rare SP is a highly desirable collectors piece that will prove difficult to replicate."}

Campaign Package of Equipment – Option S707; Factory sliding steel sunroof, green tinted glass all round, twin headlamp grille with vertical serrated lines in lens, ‘Valve Tap Cap’ style petrol cap with spring loaded cover and black inner bezel, black plastic A-pillar trims, leather bound steering wheel, slimline dimpled door lock pins.  Option code S750; Pirelli P-Slot 7mm gap alloy wheels (Code A), Pirelli inscription centre caps.  Dealer options; Genuine Golf rubber over mats.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThis cult-setting Mk1 Volkswagen Golf GTi Campaign Edition boasts ultra-rarity in being finished in factory correct Helios Blue Metallic, (Code LA5Y).  Helios Blue was never an official Mk1 Golf colour option but instead was a Mk2 Golf colour, however a handful of run-out later Mk1 Campaign’s were made in Helios Blue.  The subject of a meticulous and no expense spared full restoration, the car is simply outstanding and the work even extends to the beautifully restored and detailed underside.  Massive expense has been incurred and wherever possible genuine NOS Volkswagen parts have been used including even a genuine Volkswagen aerial grommet fitted if the first owner did not specify a dealer fit radio!  Attention to detail is mind-blowing even down to the correct vertical serrated lines in front lamp lens and the lack of rear window matt black surround, correct for only Helios Blue and Black cars.  Supplying dealer branded number plates, rear screen sticker and tax discs holder further add to the accuracy of this restoration.  \n\nINTERIOR\nBody-hugging reclining sports seats finished in iconic Black/Silver stripe design, (Code KM), are in remarkable condition with no wear to the fabric or deterioration to the seat structure.  The matching black headlining perfectly clean and intact.   The carpeting, door cards and all other interior trim sections are preserved.  The correct smaller door lock pins with indent to the top and the leather-bound steering wheel are Campaign specific and further uphold the true correct identity.  The pristine fascia is undamaged and houses a fully functional MFA digital computer.  A spotless boot area houses the full-size alloy spare and an unmolested rear parcel shelf complete with genuine rubber hangers.  A genuine NOS boot carpet and underfoam have been sourced and a Helios Blau Metallic sticker and tyre changing warning sticker remain.  Importantly the original build label sticker remains detailing all the correct features this car still displays.\n\nENGINE & TRANSMISSION\nThis desirable car is in tremendous mechanical order and really boasts what Mk1 GTi ownership should be about - marvellous fun and sheer driving pleasure!  The 1800cc fuel injected engine produces 112bhp at 5800rpm and 109lbs.ft of torque at 3500rpm, enough to sprint to 60mph in 8.2 seconds and achieve 114mph.  The detailed engine bay is pure exhibition standard and spotlessly clean displaying all the correct chassis numbers for a Campaign model.  The 5-speed sports gearbox is tight.\n\nWHEELS, TYRES & BRAKES\nThis superb Golf GTi is fitted with the unique, Campaign only, 6J x 14 Pirelli alloy sports wheels with correct larger ‘P’ cut out sections and smaller 7mm gaps.  All wheels remain in pristine condition and wear correct and virtually impossible to source Pirelli inscription centre caps that differ to the plain items found on the Mk2 GTi ‘P-Slot’.  Correct specification Pirelli P600 185/60 R14 tyres are fitted all round including the spare.  The servo-assisted diagonally divided dual-circuit braking system feature front discs and drums to the rear.\n\nHISTORY FILE\nRegistered with a correct ‘A’ prefix for Campaign models on 20th October 1983 by Volkswagen Main Dealer, Euro Canterbury, this rare Helios Blue example has undergone an incredible program of restoration which has been fully documented with eye watering documented invoices to prove.  The standard of craftmanship and attention to detail is exemplary and the two huge history folders portray the cost, time and effort born by previous owner of 11 years who commissioned the project.  A true VW enthusiast who purchased one brand new and struggled to find a good one to relive his youth, decided to purchase the very best Helios Blue car and make it brand new!  Two immaculately presented history files include masses of receipts, invoices and MOT documentation pertaining to pre and post restoration.  The vast expenditure incudes many genuine NOS Volkswagen parts.  The original V.A.G Service book pack holds the service book and all handbooks with dealership point of sale literature.\n\nMOT April 2024, HPI clear."}

The sunroof isn’t opening but it doesn’t leak. Interior is very nice. The seats were replaced with a set from a very low mileage VDP.

{"name": "1976 ROLLS ROYCE SILVER SHADOW 1 - £12,795 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 41000 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Motodrome are pleased to offer this gorgeously honest 1976 Rolls Royce Silver Shadow 1, finished in Silver Mink with dark blue leather.These stately Rolls Royces are really coming into their own now, having shrugged off their wedding car image, yet are supremely stylish (especially in mark 1 form)  and useable. That said, we're told by the last owner that it did at least one wedding last summer!This one has the usual total specification including working air conditioning, electric windows and front seats, lambswool rugs, and is fitted with Avon tyres all round. It even has an original 8 track player fitted, with some 8 track cartridges supplied.I think the paint on this one is original and hence 46 years old. In fact the entire vehicle seems really original and unmolested, with the exception of the wood interior trim which was removed and sent to a specialist in 2020 for renovation, and now has a superb finish. It also had excellent panel fit, without any dropped doors etc. The V5 shows just 5 previous owners, and it has an odometer reading of just 41000 miles -- whilst we can't warrant this, the previous owner insists it's correct. History-wise it was supplied new to Jewitt and Co Ltd of Ruddington Nottingham, who kept it for 3 years, before selling it in 1980 to the owners of Hallhill House in Renfrewshire, who kept it fully 27 years before P & A Wood, the well-known Rolls Royce specialists, acquired it in 2007. Whoever they sold it to is a bit hazy, and it seems to have disappeared from view until being acquired as part of a debt in the early 2010's. The last owner has spent quite a lot of money with a specialist  on recommissioning it and making it right, with expenditure over his past 4 years including, but not limited to:*Full 24000m service at 36566m*New water pump and belts*New front discs and pads, rear pads, and rear flexi pipes*New steering column rubber coupling, compliant mounts, axle carrier and torque arm mounts*New distributor*PAS hoses replaced*Carburettors and choke rebuilt with new gaskets and  fuel hoses*Heater system rebuilt*Replacement gearbox at 36905m*Front and rear screens removed and new seals fitted, along with new boot seal*Air conditioning system rebuilt and rechargedAll of the above has resulted in a really super-driving example, that's starts on the button hot or cold,  and simply glides along. It's absolutely addictive.With it's originality in terms of paint, chrome, and leather, it's never going to win any concours awards (but hey, it's not priced as a concours example either), but instead is a really honest, useable example that's ready to be enjoyed to the full. On our own website, you'll find our usual two videos: a walkaround appraisal, and driving impressions, both of this particular example. Based Henley-on-Thames -- viewing by prior appointment."}

I promised the Morris to my son as he helped me rebuild the car. He however emigrated to New Zealand some 5 years ago. To take the car over to New Zealand would just cost too much. We obtained a rediculous quote this year. I am 69 years of age and my health is deteriorating.

{"name": "1986 FERRARI TESTAROSSA MONDODADO - £139,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 16900 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Paris Motor Show in October 1984 saw the return of the glorious Testarossa as heir to the 512 BBi.  Pininfarina’s design broke somewhat with tradition and was both striking and innovative. The front wings flowed into one of the models most distinctive styling features, the deeply-straked door panels that grew in width towards their trailing edge, before blending into very wide rear wings. The side intakes were larger than on the previous model and this constraint saw the introduction of the long side strakes that would become the Testarossa’ s most recognisable feature.\n\n​The name Testa Rossa is Italian for Red Head and refers to the colour that the camshaft covers were painted on the sports racing models. Naturally the modern bearer of the name followed suit with red painted camshaft covers. It made its debut in the glittering surroundings of the Lido nightclub on the Champs Élysées in Paris, on the eve of the 1984 Paris Salon, where invited press and guests were given a gala preview prior to its public launch the following day. The evolution of the 12-cylinder boxer engine saw it equipped with four valves per cylinder: the most powerful engine mounted on a production sports car at the time of its launch.\n\nThe Testarossa was a model that took its name from the company’s history, being derived from the successful 500 and 250 Testa Rossa series of sports racing cars from the late fifties. It had twin belt driven overhead camshafts per bank, now driven directly off the crankshaft instead of via idler gears on the earlier Boxer models. The dry sump engine was longitudinally mounted in unit with the five -speed transmission, in a very similar manner to that of the preceding Boxer series. It was fitted with a Marelli Microplex MED 120 B electronic ignition system and Bosch KE-Jetronic fuel injection, to produce the 390bhp @ 6300rpm for European models. \n\nThis Testarossa has the rare Monodado single-nut alloy wheels. They comprise of a single central chrome plated nut on a Rudge hub.  The wheels cover large ventilated disc brakes with twin hydraulic circuits, and servo assistance. It also features all round independent suspension via wishbones, coil springs and hydraulic shock absorbers, with twin rear units plus front and rear anti roll bars.\n\nSupplied new by Crepaldi Auto Ferrari, Milan in November 1986, the Ferrari Testarossa has been carefully looked after by its previous owners. The Testarossa entered the UK in 2008, and comes complete with its leather driver’s book pack, and history file. It has been serviced up to date, including the cambelt change by a leading Ferrari specialist and is all ready to be enjoyed by the next owner. Available for viewing at our London showrooms.\n\n"}
{"name": "2000 FERRARI 360 MODENA GRNAD TURISMO - £84,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The 360 Modena was a 2-seater Berlinetta clean-sheet design which anticipated trends for future Ferrari road cars. These include lower weight combined with greater chassis rigidity – seemingly contrasting objectives that were achieved by employing innovative construction technology.\n\nThe 360 Modena is the first production Ferrari to be constructed entirely in aluminium. Chassis, bodyshell and suspension wishbones are all made from this light-weight material, which allowed the engineers to provide the best overall performance and handling ever achieved in a mid-engined Ferrari, along with levels of comfort unheard of before.\n\nThe engine was a derivation of that designed for the F355 with a small increase in cubic capacity to 3.6 litres, hence the 360 model designation. The longitudinally mid mounted 90 degree V8 engine had an actual cubic capacity of 3586cc, with a bore and stroke of 85mm x 79mm, five valves per cylinder, twin overhead camshafts per bank, and dry sump lubrication. The block, cylinder heads, sump, and sundry castings were constructed from light alloy, featuring Nicasil treated alloy cylinder liners, and titanium alloy con rods. The claimed power output was 400 bhp, which equated to 112 bhp/litre. Top speed is over 184 mph and 0-62 mph acceleration is achieved in just 4.5 secs.\n\nOur Ferrari was supplied new by Maranello Sales Ltd Ferrari in July 2000, this 360 Modena has enjoyed regular servicing with official Ferrari dealers and Ferrari specialists, (21 services). The 360 Modena is in excellent condition as you would expect at this low mileage, and still retains its orginal Ferrari leather driver’s book pack complete with Maglite torch and Ferrari spare keys. The accompanying history file is very impressive, and includes service invoices and historic MOT certificates.

The patented Revocromico roof incorporates carbon fibre structure that is hinged on a single axis with a luggage compartment lid, allowing the access to the latter even with an open roof.\n\nWhen the top is closed, the opacity of the glass in the roof can be adjusted via a dial in the cabin. The driver and passenger can either experience the full brightness of a conventional sunroof at its lightest setting, or 1% of available light at its darkest. Furthermore, the Superamerica can be transformed into a convertible at just a press of a button, with the roof rotating back to rest flush with the boot lid in just 10 seconds, leaving the rear window in place to function as a wind deflector. Of course, this does not obstruct luggage capacity, and the Superamerica’s boot swallows up more than enough luggage for two on a weekend getaway with the top up or down.\n\nWith the roof open the rear window, apart from holding the third stop light, also acts as a wind deflector. This roof design was previously used on the 2001 Vola concept designed by Leonardo Fioravanti. The Superamerica uses the higher-output tune of the V-12 engine, F133 G, rated at 533 HP (397 kw; 540 PS) and Ferrari marketed it as the world’s fastest convertible, with a top speed of 199 mph (320 km/h)! A total of 559 Ferrari Superamericas were built; this number followed Enzo Ferrari’s philosophy that there should always be one fewer car available than what the market demanded. Supplied new by Scuderia Berlin Ferrari in October 2005, the car is now registered in the UK, and is serviced up to date. Treated to a professional ceramic coating, this car was also the winner of the Platinum Certificate of Achievement at the FOC National Event in July 2017.\n\nAvailable to view at our London showrooms."}

The driving experience is superb, it is very quiet with an exemplary smooth ride, the engine and transmission etc is also very smooth and quiet. This rover is one of the best P4’s I have ever driven, it has been cherished all its life and this is reflected in the ‘on road’ driving experience, it is much admired wherever it goes. Please telephone or to discuss any interest or for further details or email."}

The plastic ended radiator has been upgraded to the aluminium option powder coated, replace the front hoses with silicone hoses, replace coolant.

{"name": "1987 CITROEN CX 25 GTI TURBO 2 4DR - £8,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 88700 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The legendary Citroën DS would always be a hard act to follow, but the new CX model quickly received accolades on its launch at the 1974 Paris Motor Show. The sleek, aerodynamic lines and sharp Kamm-type tail were designed by Robert Opron, bearing some resemblance to the earlier, smaller, GS model. The mechanical specification was typically advanced, combining Citroën's hydro-pneumatic self-levelling suspension and speed-sensitive power steering (first seen on the Citroën SM). The car sold in good numbers in Europe and won the title of European Car of The Year in 1975. \n\nSeries 2 vehicles appeared in 1985 with a slightly more aggressive look, the main difference being the use of plastic bumpers. The interior was modified but retained the distinctive driver’s console with ‘fingertip’ control layout. \n\nThe CX models were powered by a range of inline four cylinder engines, which grew from an initial capacity of 2 litres up to 2½ litres, with the highest performance option being the GTi Turbo, which had a claimed output of close to 170bhp and top speed in excess of 130mph. \n\nProduction of the range ended in 1991.\n\nThis Series 2 GTi Turbo was first registered in January 1987 and has been well looked after during its life, with 5 previous owners recorded and the mileage of a little under 89,000 believed genuine, given the service records held. \n\nThe vehicle is in good mechanical health and drives very well. It has had recent work on the hydraulic system – with 6 new (GTi specification) spheres fitted this year – and the hydro-pneumatic suspension rises quickly and quietly. The battery has also been replaced in 2022.\n\nThe body of the car is sound and solid with just a little light corrosion in the driver’s door, boot lid and bonnet. The white paintwork and colour matched bumpers present well and generally look good but could warrant some attention to return to a really smart condition. The underside of the car is in a generally good condition – it has had previous repairs carried out, but these appear well executed. The CX has its original ‘Turbo’ alloy wheels and the tyres have plenty of tread remaining.\n\nThe interior too is generally very good. It has grey herringbone cloth upholstery with both seats and carpeting in a good condition. The dashboard is unmarked and excellent. The headlining however, has started to sag and warrants attention.\n\nIn summary, this is a very original Series 2 CX, fitted with the most powerful engine variant available and, being in very good condition, offers a supremely comfortable means of high speed travel.\n\nIf desired, a second spares car and stock of spares are available separately.\n\nThe car is currently located in Dorset should viewing wish to be arranged by appointment."}
{"name": "1973 TRIUMPH TR6 LHD - £19,950 ", "transmission": " 4-SPEED MANUAL + OVERDRIVE", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The Triumph TR6 was officially introduced in January 1969 and production ran on until July 1976, by which time over 91,000 had been made, the vast majority (over 80,000) exported, nearly all to the United States. At the TR6’s launch, one press article declared it ‘the last of the real sports cars’.\n\nThe TR6 was a re-working of Triumph’s earlier TR range carried out by Karmann of Germany – retaining the traditional body-on-frame construction with four-wheel independent suspension, front disc brakes, rear drums brakes and powered by the long-lived Triumph 2.5-litre straight-six engine.\n\nUS emissions legislation meant that twin Zenith-Stromberg carbs were fitted to export vehicles, rather than the petrol injection system found in the UK. This limited outright power a little to a claimed 106bhp, but the car was still capable of close on 110mph.\n\nThis TR6 was built in May 1973 and supplied to a San Francisco agent in August of that year as a LHD North American export model. It was purchased in 1990 by its first Jersey-based owner and registered in Jersey in June of 1992.\n\nThe car is mechanically sound, well maintained and drives well. The 83,000 recorded mileage may well be correct, but we have no specific paper evidence to support this. The TR6 has the standard four-speed manual transmission but is not equipped with the optional overdrive. A rollbar has been fitted and the suspension has been fitted with polybushes – the car has seen some light competition use locally.\n\nThe bodywork on the car is sound with no substantive corrosion issues. The bright red paintwork is generally in good condition but does show signs of active use. The car’s chassis is equally sound with no marked corrosion. The bright work is good and free from scrapes and dents. In particular, the stock steel wheels with stainless trims are in very good condition, as is the convertible hood and associated mechanism (there is no hardtop with the car).\n\nThe seats, door cards and carpets are all in good condition. The dashboard is generally good but has a past split and repair. \n\nThis is a good, solid example of one of the last true classic British sports cars. It is in ‘ready to use’ condition having been fully serviced & checked in our workshops. \n\nA BMI Heritage Trust certificate is held for the vehicle, but little history in respect of its time in the US. \n\nThe car is currently Jersey registered and we can assist with shipping and importing processes if required. We can ship worldwide."}

With the Mondial, Ferrari paid tribute to its successful racing history it had made as 'la Scuderia’. The Mondial featured a blend of angular and thus pragmatic design, positioning it as Ferrari's entry-level model at the time. Today, it is considered a classic among Ferraris.\n\nPininfarina was tasked with designing the Mondial, they created a sports car that comfortably accommodated four people. This was no small feat, but Pininfarina managed it effortlessly, even leaving room for 'flying buttresses' that enhanced aerodynamics. Miraculously, they even succeeded in placing the engine between the wheelbase while accommodating four passengers. This was achieved by rotating the V8 engine a quarter turn and mounting it transversely, resulting in the car being exceptionally nimble.\n\nIn 1982, after two years in production, a 32-valve version was introduced, with four valves per cylinder instead of the previous two. The new Quattrovalvole (literally 'four valves') provided more torque and power, and it was tamed by the same manual five-speed gearbox as before, suiting the Mondial perfectly. The gear lever followed the 'dogleg' principle, where the second and third gears, as well as the fourth and fifth gears, were positioned right in front of each other for easier shifting when racing. In 1983, Ferrari launched a spacious convertible version, it was the only four-seater convertible with a mid-mounted engine that has ever been made at time of writing.\n\nIn 1985, the 3.0 litre engine was enlarged to 3.2 litres, coinciding with the release of the Ferrari 328, that uses the same engine. This variant was officially referred to as the 'Mondial 3.2.' A final iteration arrived in 1988 under the name 'Mondial t’, featuring a longitudinal engine layout while retaining the transversally mounted gearbox. The 't' version retained the same V8 engine but increased its size to 3.4 litres.\n\nProduction of the Mondial continued until 1993, a total of 6,149 were built. This unique car, though not succeeded by a direct successor, enters in history as the last mid-engined four-seater V8-powered Ferrari.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 454 (179 inch)\nWidth (cm): 180 (71 inch)\nHeight (cm): 127 (50 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 265 (104 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1400 (3086 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: transversely mounted 3186 cc V8 mid-engine\nValve gear: 32\nFuel system: Bosch K-Jet\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 270 hp (199 kW) at 7000 t/m\ntorque: 304 Nm at 5500 t/m\nTop speed: 250 km/h (155 mph)"}

{"name": "1981 PORSCHE 911 3.0 SC - €45,000 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The Porsche 911 is the exception that proves the rule “to all good things comes an end”. This contemporary and luxurious, yet sporty, German sportscar was released in 1963. To this day, they are still being produced in large numbers, also a range of variants has been developed to mimic a tailor-made product range. Although the 911 has been refined over the decades, the basic design – which is recognisable and thus sublime – has generally remained unchanged. This pragmatic and contemporary approach only Porsche could ever succeed in.\n\nThe 911 is the successor to the Porsche 356 and was designed by Ferdinand Porsche - the grandson of Porsche’s founder – and presented at the Frankfurt Auto Show in the autumn of 1963. In 1964, the first models were delivered to customers, and due to its great success, the 911 was soon expanded: a cheaper 912, a faster 911S and the rollbar equipped and extremely safe convertible Targa were released. This Targa was named after a Sicilian race that was year by year won by Porsche.\n\nInitially, this car would be called the Porsche 901, but Peugeot became the headwind as their models were named by a three-digit number with a 0 in the middle. “Don’t worry”, said Porsche and they replaced the 0 with a 1. The Porsche 911 was born! After that, there was still Porsche cars built that were named with a three-digit number with a 0 in the middle, however those were exclusively intended for racing and circuit purposes, not for public roads.\n\nUndoubtedly, the 911 has been modified over the years; as durable a design may be, times change, and cars do too. Porsche has always been prepared for changes and innovation. They gradually increased the engine displacement, the power and the size. The biggest mechanical change was the transition from air cooled engines to water cooled engine. Water cooled engines ensure an evenly cooled engine, which results in uniform combustion. This results in lower consumption and less emission.\n\nPorsche 911 SC\n\nIn 1978, the Porsche 911 SC was revealed as being the last 911 (maybe). This is reflected in its model name, as SC stands for ‘Super Carrera’, as they wanted to finish this series with a climax. At Porsche, there was some doubt about whether to continue the 911 series, as the intended successor, the 928, had already entered the ‘Porsche flagship fray’, if we may. However, the 928 never managed to match the 911's fame.\n\nThe 911 SC didn't bring many changes, which is perfectly fine. Initially, there was a targa or a coupe, as usual, in 1983, the first 911 cabriolet was brought to life. There was a wide package of options, which gave customers more freedom of choice. This was well received as the SC was considered an ‘entry-level’ and ‘alternative’ option to the Turbo. The iconic ‘whale tail’ and the - also iconic - Fuchs rims were the main features of this options package. Customers could also opt for a blue and red paint scheme - ‘Martini edition’ - that was available due to Porsche's circuit successes.\n\nAll doubt got left behind, Porsche decided not to stop 911 production, the car had become a real icon. Nowadays, the car remains very popular, thus it is a highly sought-after car. There’s even big community of 911 aficionados, ensuring its rocketing market demand.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 429 (169 inch)\nWidth (cm): 165 (65 inch)\nHeight (cm): 131 (52 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 227 (89 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1180 (2601 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 2994 cc flat-six air-cooled rear-engine\nValve gear: 12\nFuel system: Bosch K-Jetronic\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 204 hp (152 kW) at 5900 t/m\ntorque: 267 Nm at 4300 t/m\nTop speed: 235 km/h (146 mph)"}
{"name": "1974 MINI INNOCENTI 1300 - €18,250 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 87919 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Buy-and-drive, comes with recent maintenance bills\nBritish-Italian, brings the best of both worlds for a good price\nSporty whole with racing seats and four-point seat belts\nThe Mini, a small car with a big story. In 1959, British car manufacturer British Motor Corporation (BMC) released the Mini, it is obvious that they had a clear goal in mind: releasing a small city-fit car with a cute design. Thanks to The Beatles and its starring in countless famous films, the car has acquired an iconic status over the decades.\n\nIt was Alec Issigonis, a British-Greek car designer that worked for BMC, who gave birth to the Mini. He had a clear goal in mind: to create an affordable and fuel-efficient car that is efficient and light-steering in narrow British city streets. This approach, along with the playful design, created a true hype among young people. The Mini also became extremely popular with influential people, to the point that all members of The Beatles - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr - proudly show off their Minis. In 1969, the car takes on the leading role in the film The Italian Job, in which bank robbers used a Mini as a getaway car. Also Mr. Bean’s car is a lime green 1977 Mini, which emphasizes his clumsiness in the best way possible.\n\nInitially, the Mini was manufactured in various finishes, such as a sedan, a station wagon, a van, and even a pickup truck. Those finishes never really became fancied among the crowd. Also, in the 1980s, the Mini began losing its fame due to fierce competition from other car brands. This caused a harsh financial crisis in 1986 at British Leyland - the former BMC that also own Jaguar, Rover, Triumph, and MG. They even decide to restructure and privatize the company and from that moment on Rover Group was born. In 1994, Rover Group sells Mini to BMW, which seven years later, in 2001, launch a refined version of the Mini. Nowadays BMW still produce the Mini – baring its British identity in mind – and it is available in various finishes: a convertible, a fully electric version, a hybrid version, a sports version, and even a station wagon.\n\nAs mentioned before, the goal was to build a city car that fit in traffic in cities, therefore they had to use as little space as possible, that was a real challenge in the middle of the 20th century. The 1950s are often considered a tipping point in automotive technology, and the Mini has contributed to that tipping point: a front-wheel drive car with a transverse and space-saving engine that is highly responsive and fit to city traffic.\n\nToday, the Mini is a coveted classic car, and not only among classic car enthusiasts. The cute and vulnerable design simply captures everyone's hearts.\n\nInnocenti Mini\n\nNot only was the Mini precious in Great Britain, also in Italy, the eyes couldn't be kept away from the Mini. What hindered its success was the protectionist policy, particularly in the automobile industry, though, the British found a solution. In 1965, BMC entered into an agreement with the versatile Innocenti, an Italian company founded in 1931, which produced refrigerators, motorcycles, and cars under license. Through this collaboration, BMC were able to bring their Mini to the Italian market and offer it at a competitive price.\n\nFrom the get-go, the Mini Innocenti was not much different from the original Mini. The earliest edition was delivered as a knock-down kit, but this approach was quickly abandoned. The Mini Innocenti continued to be produced until 1993, and the only thing it really retained after a facelift in 1975 was its model name, due to the many changes it underwent.\n\nThe Mini Innocenti, the one built under BMC's supervision from 1965 to 1975, is just as sought after today as the British Mini. There are some technical differences that enthusiasts truly appreciate. It remains a unique car.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 307 (121 inch)\nWidth (cm): 144 (57 inch)\nHeight (cm): 134 (53 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 204 (80 inch)\nWeight (kg): 690 (1521 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 1275 cc straight-four front-engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: 2 SU carburettors\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: FWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 63 hp (47 kW) at 5800 t/m\ntorque: 98 Nm at 5800 t/m\nTop speed: 157 km/h (98 mph)"}

BMW managed to get concurring give concurrence to Ferrari and Porsche with perhaps their most prestigious model they had produced up to that point.\n\nAs early as 1981, ideas were suggested to bring an exceptional model to the market that would, on one hand, compete fiercely with Ferrari's sports cars and, on the other hand, take on the German rival Porsche, specifically the Porsche 928. Given the booming sales of the BMW 6 Series in the 1980s, plans for an 8 Series were put on hold, particularly until 1990. After almost a decade of development, the E31 was unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. It was a sleek coupe with, under the hood, a five-litre V12 engine and either an automatic four-speed or a manual six-speed transmission, the latter being absolutely unusual at that time, even by sports car standards. As an illustration, the E31 was the first V12-powered car ever operated with a manual six-speed.\n\nThe BMW 850Ci, the only model in the E31 series until 1992, offered everything it needed to: it was sleek, sporty, luxurious, and extremely well-performing. However, orders came in slowly. Just as it was being presented to the public, the Gulf War broke out, stifling the entire launch of the 8 Series. Therefore, BMW decided to introduce a lighter V8-powered variant that delivered slightly less power, the 840Ci. In addition to the 840Ci, there was a plan to bring an M8 to the market, but it never happened. Therefore, the original 850Ci model was upgraded to the 850CSi, serving as a replacement for the eventually never-released M8. Concrete blueprints for an E31 convertible were also ready, although it never went in production.\n\nJust over thirty thousand E31 models were sold, with the 850Ci being the top seller at just over twenty thousand sold cars. Despite the somewhat turbulent history of the E31, it cannot be denied that it is a sports car that hit the history books.\n\nBMW 840Ci\n\nIn the E31 series, the 840Ci may not objectively be the most powerful version, but it is by far the one held in the highest regard by enthusiasts. This is because a lighter V8 engine was used instead of the heavy V12, making it lighter than the 850Ci, which weighed almost two thousand kilograms.\n\nThe 840Ci was added to the E31 lineup in 1992 and was equipped with a 4.0-litre V8 engine until 1995. In 1996, BMW decided to increase the engine size by ten percent to 4.4 litres.\n\nThe 840Ci was built until 1999, nearly eight thousand units rolling off the assembly line. Today, this stylish BMW is on the rise, boldly joining the ranks of classics as a ‘young timer’.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 478 (188 inch)\nWidth (cm): 186 (73 inch)\nHeight (cm): 134 (53 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 268 (106 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1855 (4090 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 4398 cc V8 front-engine\nValve gear: 32\nFuel system: MPI\nGear box: 5-speed automatic\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 286 hp (210 kW) at 5700 t/m\ntorque: 420 Nm at 3900 t/m\nTop speed: 250 km/h (155 mph)"}

Introduced at the 2009 Geneva Motorshow, the 458 proved a huge step up in both design and technology from its predecessor, the F430.\n\nPowered by a 4.5 litre, flat-plane crank, naturally aspirated V8, that was deemed to be so spectacular that it won several Engine of the Year awards, the 458 is characterised by its ability to rev, as well as the cultured but wonderful howl that it produces. With such a special engine, an upgrade was needed from the ageing single clutch transmission that was used in the F430; therefore, Ferrari sourced the lightning-fast double clutch auto from Getrag, which was also used in period by Mercedes for the SLS AMG. This meant that the 458 now had a gearbox that could do justice to the incredible engine it was mated to.\n\nThe 458 was Ferrari’s final naturally aspirated V8 production car, bringing to a close a chapter of Ferrari’s history that saw some of its finest ever cars being produced. As well as this, the 458 was also one of the final Ferraris to be penned by Pininfarina, the legendary Italian design house that has been responsible for some of Ferrari’s most iconic vehicles. As testament to the quality of the 458’s design, its successors, the 488 and the F8 Tributo, have remained largely unchanged from the original shape penned by Pininfarina 14 years ago.\n\nAs a result, many regard the 458 to be the last of its kind, making it both a great potential investment, but also one of the all-time-great Ferraris.\n\nThis beautiful 458 was delivered to Graypaul Birmingham in December 2011, and comes with an extensive carbon fibre interior specification, featuring both carbon fibre racing seats and the carbon fibre racing package, which are two sought-after options. The classic pairing of Rosso Corsa over Nero suits the 458 particularly well, and the addition of the optional 20” forged diamond-finish alloys help to compliment this colour combination. This 458 boasts some other choice options, such as satellite navigation, iPod connectivity and Bluetooth, as well as front and rear parking sensors and cruise control, and when coupled with full Ferrari service history from new, this is evidently a fantastic example of a very special, future-proof car, that still looks as fresh as the day it was unveiled.\n\nService History:\n\n30/10/2012 – Graypaul Birmingham, 2149 miles\n\n29/10/2013 – Graypaul Nottingham, 3592 miles\n\n10/11/2014 – H.R.

To achieve this, electric items such as electric windows and mirrors were changed with manual parts. ABS was not available and the narrow body model had no sunroof, fog lights or rear windscreen wiper. These changes made the GT-Four Rally 40 kg lighter than the normal Four.

JZR stands for John Ziemba Restorations, named after brand’s founder. Since the late 1980s, John Ziemba is selling three-wheelers in kit form. It's a unique concept that was inspired by the three-wheelers made by the fellow countryman Morgan in the 1930s. Nowadays, JZR's are still in production, although the production was interrupted from 1998 to 2000.\n\nJohn Ziemba was passionate about the three-wheelers Morgan made in the 1930s. He decided to assemble them himself and officially started selling them under his own name in 1990, albeit in kit form. Customers put the three-wheeler together entirely by themselves and all JZR's are, therefore, hand-built, adding even more charm to them. Moreover, the kit assembly allows for easy tinkering or repairing if needed.\n\nA JZR is rear-wheel-driven, with all the power transmitted through the rear wheel. Customers have the option to choose from different engines offered by various famous motor manufacturers from around the world. Among them are engines from Honda, the Italian Moto Guzzi, and even the well-known Harley-Davidson.\n\nJZR's have a sleek design and offer an aesthetic neoclassicism that takes you back to the 1930s. The exhaust pipes are mounted along the entire length of the body, becoming a prominent part of the elegant and aerodynamic structure that provides both the comfort and space of a car while being powered by powerful roaring motorcycle engines.\n\nEach JZR is unique, has its own story, and provides an amazing driving experience. They are also rare, which adds to their value.\n\nMoto Guzzi 850\n\nAs mentioned, JZR offered different engines, and one of those was from Moto Guzzi. Moto Guzzi is a prominent Italian motorcycle manufacturer that still produces two-wheelers under the Piaggio group. So, choosing Moto Guzzi was a logical choice for JZR.\n\nFrom the Moto Guzzi T3 model, JZR took the drivetrain, a V-twin engine with 844 cc and 68 horsepower on the crankshaft, powered by two Dell'Orto carburettors. The blend of Italian motor engineering with the stylish British design brings the best of two worlds."}

In 1998, Volkswagen purchased Rolls-Royce and Bentley, soon after deciding to produce a Rolls-Royce convertible, based on the Azure but with the newer styling of the Silver Seraph.\n\nIn 1999, the Rolls-Royce Corniche V was launched and was the first and last new Rolls-Royce launched under Volkswagen, also becoming the first and last Rolls-Royce developed from a Bentley model, rather than vice versa. While it shared the Azure’s platform, the bodywork was entirely bespoke to the Corniche and was far more modern in its styling than the Bentley counterpart, benefitting from the Seraph styling. It truly makes for a stunning vehicle, both inside and out as along with the Seraph styled exterior, it also features the interior design of the Seraph. This combined with its extreme rarity with only 374 cars ever being built makes for an incredibly special automobile on all levels.\n\nIt also must be said that whilst having launched in the new era of Rolls-Royce and Bentley, it is still a coach-built car, and as with the phenomenal Continental R, T, SC and Azures, it is the arguably the last coach-built Rolls-Royce model before production of newer cars became more conventional.\n\nCorniche Vs rarely come in such a stunning specification as the car we are proud to present you today, finished in Silver Pearl over Stratos Grey leather interior with French Navy Blue Connolly leather piping, Steering Wheel, Dashboard and Dark Blue carpets in the cockpit and in the boot, as well as Burr Walnut veneers with inlays and Walnut trims on the steering wheel. Also featuring a Navy Blue hood and the 17inch Chrome wheels exclusive to the Corniche V, making one of the most elegant specifications we have ever seen on this rare model. It has also importantly covered a mere 16,000 miles from new, making it one of the lowest mileage examples in the world. The car comes with service records, original handbooks and tools.\n\nWhether you’re an avid Rolls-Royce collector or want the ultimate cruiser for the stunning roads of the Azure Coast in the South of France, this is a magnificent opportunity. So rarely do these Corniche Vs come up for sale, let alone in this condition and in such great colours, not to be missed!\n\nNow available for viewing at the DD Classics Dealership in London, please call 0208 878 3355 for more information.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the above information but errors may occur.

In doing so, an aspect of re-organising the company in light of it’s bankruptcy proceedings was a benefit of a $2,000 warrantee for each purchased car. Since production models are rumored to have an entry price of over $100,000, this as-new Karma is bound to showcase exceptional value.\n\nIt is no surprise that the Karma has been built to spectacular looking standards, given that Henrik Fisker was also responsible the Aston Martin Vantage and the BMW Z8. It goes without saying however, that the Karma exceeds all expectations by providing a functional touch and a unique aesthetic mainly attributed by the car’s solar roof panels. These act as a supplement for charging the battery, not only adding to the car’s electric mileage, but keeping the air conditioning functioning at a set temperature even if the car is not running.\n\nBased on a bespoke aluminium spaceframe that carries a mid-mounted battery pack on its longitudinal spine, the 2012 Karma ES carries a 2.0-litre, 260bhp front engine.\n\nAstonishingly, on the battery power alone, this particular Karma ES can accelerate from 0-60 mph in less than 8 seconds, but when the engine is activated this time is slashed to a short 5.9 seconds.\n\nThe electric- and gasoline-powered motors work together to create a combined output of 402 bhp, 2.0-liter Ecotec turbocharged inline four-cylinder engine with two rear-mounted AC electric motors, single-speed direct-drive transmission, front and rear independent suspension, and four-wheel Brembo regenerative brakes.\n\nThis outstanding Fisker Karma was built originally for the Italian market and was supplied by Fisker Italia Concessionnaires 10-05-2012. Benefitting from the highly desirable option of Shadow paint, finished by using a special technique of blended paint and ground-up particles of glass, giving this Karma ES a very stylish and head-turning look. With Sabbia hide matching carpets and top role the car oozes class and sophistication.\n\nBy including a cutting-edge hybrid design and technology, the Karma ES suits the daily driver and will surely be a future collectable.\n\nNow available for viewing at the DD Classics Dealership in London, please call for more information.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the above information but errors may occur.

Ivory piping, mirror finish Burr Walnut wood set and matching hood bag trimmed to match the main hide. Colour coded bumpers and stainless-steel polished wheel trims with painted wheel embellishers to match the coachwork. Series II cars benefitted from a host of cosmetic and technical features which included redesigned seats which were fully electric and with added bonus of a memory option as well, air conditioning, cruise control, town & country horns. A prettier fascia was also installed with overall instruments to match the mile meter. ABS brakes and fuel injection as standard equipment – solex injection was removed which increased the overall power by 14% to make high speed driving even more effortless. \n\nHaving covered 24,000 miles from new over the past 35 years this is truly an exceptional example of the marque to be able to present. \n\nBuilt to North American specification, this incredible car left the Mulliner Park Ward, Willesden factory in 1988 and shipped across the Atlantic to its first lucky owner. In 2007 the car was acquired by previous owner at 16,708 miles and the RR resided at their glamours NY address 150 West and 26th Street. During their 15-year ownership the Corniche covered 8,000 miles.  \n\nDoor and hood fitment is critical to these coachbuilt cars and this car ticks all the boxes. The hood fits water tight around the windscreen and all of the timber is in perfect order. The best reflection of how one of these cars should have been maintained is to inspect the Wilton carpet, we always pay a particular amount of attention to this when we are buying these cars. Correctly looked after this weave is made to last a life time. The Wilton throughout this example even inside the boot is as new, no sign of wear – a true reflection of how this example has been cherished.  \n\nAccompanying the car we have the complete set of factory supplied owner hand books, tool set, US title and factory dating certification on file.  \n\nThe Corniche has its origins in the South of France, a part of the world with close associations with Sir Henry Royce, who carried out much of his design work at his winter home La Villa Mimosa at Le Canadel. \n\nOn February 4th 1971 Rolls-Royce Ltd went into receivership following an unmanageable blow out of the development costs of the RB211 jet engine, a new larger engine which the company was developing for the new generation of wide-bodied jets, including the Lockhead Tristar. Motor car production, however, continued without interruption on the specific instructions of E.R. Nicholson who was the receiver, subsequently, he separated the motor car and diesel engine divisions from the aero engine business and in May 1973 a new public company Rolls-Royce Motors Ltd, was formed. \n\nNow available for viewing at the DD Classics Dealership in London, please call 0208 878 3355 to book an appointment.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the above information but errors may occur.

There are a few minor expected niggles but nothing major (the inspector mentioning that he was only bringing to attention a few of the issues because I was still paying full MoT costs but without the ticket). No major holes, rot or issues. It's now fully road legal and registered after DVLA inspection and has had it's first few trips out already. It's taken almost 6 months to get it here so advertising this much sooner than I wanted or expected to. I've had chance to look over the vehicle and pretty much everything works as it should. It starts excellent with a strong engine and lovely sound through the (new) twin exhaust system. Solid body, and clean brightwork. It's a beautiful looking (and driving) cruiser with a 'used' interior that could do with tidying up, although this does not detract from the overall feel and presence of the car. It's a three on the tree manual which shifts smoothly through the gears. Brakes have been serviced (as can be seen in the original ad pic) along with gas tank, E brake and others.

My father bought it new and in latter years it has been owned by either me or my sister. Mileage is a genuine 52285 and will increase a tiny bit as I use it about once a week locally. MoT to Sept 2024 and drives very smooth. Unfortunately the service book has been mislaid at some point over the years. We do have the handbook though. It had a Toyota dealer servicing for the first few years. Since then we had our local mechanic do it, including periodic timing belt changes etc. It's done very few miles these last few years, but it starts within the first second and is very reliable. I'm mechanically minded (engineer by training) and keep an eye on things. It has a few dings etc here and there, nothing extreme by any means and underneath is completely sound as far as I know. "}

{"name": "1971 JAGUAR 420G AUTOMATIC RHD 1971 - £35,000 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC 3-SPEED", "mileage": " 72000 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "1971 JAGUAR 420G Automatic RHD – The Jaguar Mk.X started production in late 1961 with the 3.8 Lt In-line Six Engine, and ran until July 1964, when it was replaced by the identical unchanged car but for a larger 4.2 Lt Engine fitted – in turn this model continued until August 1966.   At that time the production line changed over to making the newly renamed model, the 420G – again basically the same car design barring the various running changes that had already foregone by the predecessor “Mark Ten” 4.2 model.   These 420G models were fitted with triple carburettors and gave well above average performance with 11.5 sec 0-100 kph (62 mph) and a top speed in the region of 185 kph (115 mph) wasn’t exactly slow for a 3-speed automatic 54 years ago – remember this car was designed for the Luxury Saloon market segment, and not meant to be a Sporting Saloon at some 5,000 lbs in weight!   On the contrary, it really shone with five adult occupants covering large distances in great comfort and plenty of interior legroom, courtesy of its 10-foot wheelbase.  \nThe 420G model should not be confused with the 1967 version of the previous “S Type” 3.4 and 3.8 models which BMC called the 420 and was intrinsically the S-Type with slight design change and a larger 4.2 lt engine.  The entire JAGUAR range of current models was replaced by the XJ6 model during 1971 with a choice of 2.8 or 4.2 engined cars.\nOnly 118 units of the 420G model total 4,430 RHD examples built came to South Africa.   This car was 237th last RHD Browns Lane built unit in the 420G-series.     It was seemingly originally a LEYKOR Head Office demonstrator because it was already registered as a 1971 model on registration CY 6006 for Belville (near Cape Town), Western Cape.    \nThe car’s first general public owner was a Mr Crawford, an affluent farmer of Vrede in the then Orange Free State.   He purchased the car from LE ROUX LEYKOR Showroom in Kempton Park, Johannesburg in July 1972.  He was known by his family to only use it on family trips, it was his pride and joy, and he ensured it was always properly garaged, regularly cleaned, and maintained to the highest standards.   He lived on his farm to a very high old age, and when he passed away a few years ago the car was inherited by his nephew who then shortly after sold the car to my client – whom I act for as his Broker.   In essence this is a two-owner car – disregarding LEYKOR (Leyland SA) - with only 72,000 genuine recorded miles on the odometer.   The car is still totally original, and obviously a matching numbers car ex-factory, it also unusually for South Africa still has the original full set of Owners Books in the pouch they were supplied in.  Apart from the spare wheel and wheel changing tools, it also has its original and impressive Jaguar toolkit still intact.   \nApparently less than 60 examples are still registered on UK roads.   So, the fact that nobody has managed to find any rust on this car - to the bodywork or entire under-carriage - is witness to the fact that it resided in the above escarpment region of warm weather without snow or salty ozone, and the care of her almost lifelong owner.   Notably this car has not been given an intensive major service or a detailed valet of the entire vehicle yet.  \nThis is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the only example against all comers, that is totally original.   Furthermore, the car is extremely rare because apart from still having the original Blaupunkt Radio, and electric windows to all four doors, it must be one of very few that were fitted with factory optioned Air Conditioning.  \nI’m aware that this car could easily demand a much higher purchase price – but if it was cheap, it would be half the price.   If it required a super-critical observation, the interior wood needs to be restored by a French Polisher and the engine bay could do with some minor detailing – the deliberate cost saving is against higher priced examples is intended to allow the Buyer a large budget to correct these minor flaws along with plenty of change.  This car is already in superb mechanical condition, that you can drive stress-free.\n\nIn summary you can proceed to do a blind-buy based upon my description as all of my past customers have done – everybody gets their cars!  It’s called bond, honour, and trust!   So, you decide or just keep looking elsewhere – and wonder later, if only?\n\nThe Purchase Price of (GBP) £35,000 includes everything, down to the very last conceivable charge for this car to be car-carrier delivered from her collection to Cape Town, the major service and valet already allured towards, fully Export Cleared, Shipped in a 2-car Sea-Container, full LLOYDS In-Transit Insurance, all SA Forwarding & UK Clearing Agent Fees, UK Port Arrival charges, HMRC Import Duty, Collection from London Gateway and Delivery to the Warehouse near Cambridge, MoT and DVLA registration and Black period-plates.   \n\nAll you need to do is insure the car and drive her home.   Or, if you can contain the excitement and are too busy with your schedule, then we can do a transporter delivery to your home at extra charge per distance.\n\nFor all other RHD country enquiries, please enquire for your applicable charges.\n\nCall and leave a message or WhatsApp if you want to be contacted – I travel quite often.

While largely based on the 308 GTB and GTS respectively, small modifications were made to the body style and engine, including an increase in engine displacement to 3.2 L (3185 cc). 7,400 Ferrari 328s were produced by the time the model was replaced by the new 348 in 1989, bringing the total for the 308/328 generation to nearly 20,000. The 328 is considered by some Ferrari enthusiasts to be one of the most reliable Ferraris; unlike some models, most engine maintenance can be performed without lowering the engine from the vehicle.\n\nThe 328 GTS model, together with the fixed roof 328 GTB, were the final developments of the normally aspirated transverse V8 engine 2-seat series. The 328 figures in the model title referred to the total cubic capacity of the engine, 3.2 litres, and 8 for the number of cylinders.

European competition included the 1960s FF layout Renault Estafette and the FR layout Ford Transit. The FF layout Citroen H Van though, pre-dated the VW by three years. As of January 2010, updated versions of the Type 2 remain in production in international market - as a passenger van, as a cargo van, and as a pickup truck. Like the Beetle, the van has received numerous nicknames worldwide, including the \"microbus\", \"minibus\", and, due to its popularity during the counterculture movement of the 1960s, \"Hippie van\". Autocar magazine has announced the T2 will cease production on December 31, 2013, due to the introduction of more stringent safety regulations in Brazil.\n\nIn late 1967, the second generation of the Volkswagen Type 2 (T2) was introduced. It was built in Germany until 1979. In Mexico, the Volkswagen Combi and Panel were produced from 1970 to 1994. Models before 1971 are often called the T2a (or \"Early Bay\"), while models after 1972 are called the T2b (or \"Late Bay\").  This second-generation Type 2 lost its distinctive split front windshield, and was slightly larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor. Its common nicknames are Breadloaf and Bay-window, or Loaf and Bay for short. (24) At 1.6 L and 35 kW (48 PS; 47 bhp) DIN, the engine was also slightly larger. The new model also did away with the swing axle rear suspension and transfer boxes previously used to raise ride height.

This car was restored and resprayed some years ago photos, history and bills going way back. It has always been particularly well looked after since. It has overdrive, sounds good, goes well and has absolutely no problems. Everything works as it should except the clock. The interior and hood are excellent and it has a good tonneau and a hood cover. All good tyres and a new HD battery. The bumpers are ok but would benefit from rechroming. The only reason for sale is that I am now too old with a damaged back to get in and out easily. It needs a new home where it can be looked after in the manner to which it has become accustomed. Don't miss out. This is a good one."}

{"name": "1986 BMW Z1 - £29,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This is an ultra-rare, original UK supplied BMW Z1 and these cars are fast coming very collectable. The Z1 was only in production from 1989 to 1991, just 8000 cars were built and all were in LHD drive format. The majority of the 8000 were sold in Germany (6443) so UK home market cars are much more scarce. The These cars were the first in BMW’s line of Z series roadsters and were unique for their plastic body panels, vertically sliding doors which drop into the sills and is one of the first BMW’s to use a multi-link suspension. The drive train is the fantastic 2.5 litre straight six engine with 5 speed manual transmission and these cars really are fabulous to drive.\nH247 HFJ is a fantastic opportunity to purchase one of these highly desirable cars at a very sensible price. Most of the cars life has been with its second owner who purchased the car from L&C Group Ltd BMW in Tonbridge Wells when it had covered 30,000 miles when just a few years old. Its long-term owner, an accountant then used the BMW as his everyday car. Once the car reached around 180,000 miles, BMW main agents supplied a brand new engine and around 45,000 miles have been covered since then. The BMW was also fully re-painted due to stone chips and marks commensurate with everyday use, new light covers, a new soft top and was regularly serviced to ensure reliability. Having had in the region of 20 years daily use, the BMW was dry stored or 3-4 years with 222,000 miles before being sold to the most recent owner. A further 3000 miles have been covered since.\n\nThe engine and transmission are in excellent order and the car drives like it was just a few years old and without doubt it hugley benefits from the new engine. It has a set of almost new tyres, has recently been fully serviced, had new brake discs and pads, some new fuel lines and a brand-new old stock rear subframe that has come from BMW. With its stunning, gleaming paintwork, excellent wheels, superb straight body and excellent underside, this is a fantastic car that has essentially had restoration work over the past ten years that puts the car into beautiful condition. The interior is very nicely presented, the hood is still as new and the BMW is ready to use and enjoy."}
{"name": "1989 PORSCHE 911 964 CARRERA CABRIOLET - £76,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "We are delighted to offer this beautifully presented, low mileage Mercedes Benz 500SL onto the market. Finished in the highly desirable rare colour of Anthracite Grey, this is one of the very late R107 models that feature the more powerful 242bhp engine and improved handling thanks to the revised front suspension. Without doubt, this one of the best SL models of a range that spanned an impressive eighteen years. This example has covered just 70,700 miles and has had just three owners from new and comes with the desirable rear seats option, retains beautiful full Grey leather upholstery, excellent soft top and factory hard top.\nThe 500SL spent its first 26 years with one lady owner, supplied new out of Liverpool to a Lancashire based lady owner who took the car to her second home in Portugal until around 1999. Over the first ten years of ownership, the Mercedes Benz covered little over 43,000 miles and in 1999 the Mercedes Benz came back to her Lancashire family home. From 2009 the mileage slowed down, only covering 16000 miles and used more as a weekend car rather than its all year dry climate use in Portugal. From 2009 to 2015, the SL only covered 600 miles and sold to its second owner in Hale, Cheshire with 59800 miles.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2020 the second owner has thoroughly enjoyed the car, covering over 10,000 miles in almost five years. The SL was used for some classic shows, the summer office commute into Manchester and general weekend use. Over this period the car was incredibly well maintained with invoices totalling over £4000 to include regular servicing, a new stainless-steel exhaust system and new rear brake discs and pads. In 2020 the SL has had a full service to include oil and fiiter change, new HT leads, distributor cap, rotor arm and new plugs before we sold the car to its most recent in Essex who has covered around 700 miles in three years of ownership. Since 2020 the SL has been maintained by Waterhouse Cars in Essex with invoices on file for almost £2000.\n\nF425 PNC has arrived with us in lovely condition throughout. On close inspection its clear to see the SL has led a sheltered life and has spent much of its time well garaged and carefully stored. The car presents beautifully with a lovely deep Grey paint finish, the bodywork is generally in excellent order and the Grey leather upholstery is lovely throughout fitting with its low mileage of 70,700. Alloy wheels are in excellent order, the engine bay and boot area is well presented and on the road the car does not disappoint. Performance from the 5.0 V8 engine and four speed automatic transmission are excellent, it cruises, holds the road and handles perfectly and there is no doubt, these iconic long distance luxury open top tourers offer power, performance, comfort, class and will continue to be in high demand. With low mileage 500SL's now commanding double our asking price, we feel this fantastic car offers exceptional value."}

The car comes today with all its original manuals and booklets, original supplying dealer PDI check sheet, MOT’s spanning back 25 years and various maintenance invoices and old tax discs.\nSwinford Motors in Stourbridge supplied the SL new, carrying out the PDI on the 18th May 1989. The supplying dealer carried out early services at 881, 6339, 11931, and 16103 miles in 1993. Solihull Mercedes Benz serviced the SL at 18968 miles before main agents Monarch Cars in Tamworth stamped the book at 33497 miles followed by Mercedes Benz Speeds of Chesterfield who carried a service in 1998 at 42964 miles. In 2001 the SL had moved north and M-Tech Auto services near Doncaster carried out a service at 46829 miles followed by another local service at 51000 miles. The car then headed to the North East where its been ever since, and has been maintained by SL specialists Diamond Garage. They have serviced the car at 55610, 57844, 59569, 62082, 62575 and 63679 miles. Also within the past few thousand miles the SL has had new tyres all round, a new electric aerial and battery.\n\nF496 JFK is an incredibly correct, first class car. The bodywork is exceptional throughout, the Signal Red paintwork stunning with a gleaming finish, and chrome work, rubbers and trims are all excellent. The interior is outstanding, almost too good to be original with beautiful Beige front and rear seats, excellent carpets, door cards and dashboard. The boot compartment is excellent, the spare wheel well as clean as the rest of the car and floor pans and engine bay excellent. The hard top is in lovely order, the mohair hood lovely and the hood stowage compartment all original and superbly clean. It is very clear this car has been cherished, it has been used for Mercedes Benz National events and on close inspection you can see the high level of detail that has gone into the car to keep it in such beautiful order. On the road performance is as expected of a low mileage, well maintained SL. It offers power, performance, luxury and is the perfect long distance cruiser. The V8 engine sounds fantastic, the gear changes are smooth and the car handles beautifully feeling precise, tight and as you'd expect on an SL just a few years old. This is a very special car and it won't disappoint"}

Factory extras including: sports seats, walnut dash and steering wheel, Sony CD/radio with remote control, cross-member covers, Librands sports gearshift, luggage rack, round mirrors and wing top lights. Fitted tool kit. Factory rustproofed from new. The car additionally has the great benefit of a Simmonds easy-up hood in mohair with matching leather hood bag and mohair tonneau cover - these hoods are so good the factory later adopted it's own version as standard. Good service history including cambelt change. Three sets of keys including the important master key. In excellent condition throughout and drives beautifully. "}

Recently fully restored and MOT'd to 29th November. Done just over 200 miles since restoration. Originally supplied as a running chassis to Motourists Ltd., Great North Road, London. This was common after the second world war (reference page 19 of 'Completely Morgan' by Ken Hill). These coach builders would build their own body and this would probably account for the spare wheel being mounted in the same way as the early competition cars for the Le Mans and Tourist Trophy races (reference page 30 of 'Completely Morgan'). The car was found in the USA in a bad state and brought back to the UK in 2019. It was sold at auction in the UK and restored over a period of 3 years. The original engine, a Standard Special, had been replaced by an early Standard Triumph engine and gearbox from a 1961 Triumph Spitfire (this probably happened while in the USA and was registered there with this engine). This has been rebuilt with new bearing shells, piston rings, valves, valve guides and springs, plus new clutch and rebuilt gearbox. The car has been completely dismantled and restored where necessary. The original chassis was not too bad but even so it was considered that some plating of the top and bottom surfaces, plus minor plating on the sides, would be an advantage. All the front and rear suspension components including the axles and brakes, plus the steering, are all original as found on the car but have been carefully rebuilt. Where necessary the wooden framework has been repaired or replaced and chrome work restored. All the tyres are new. There was no sign that a hood had ever been fitted, so to maintain the lines of the car a new one has not been created. However, a simple full tonneau has been made to cover the whole cockpit when necessary. Over 600 photographs of the restoration are available. Contact 07817159428 for further information.

Since then, the car has been in cosseted dry storage, but a few weeks ago he contacted my counterpart in Cape Town asking for a mandated sale – as the cost of shipping and importing to his new home country was prohibitive.   \nInstead, the car was purchased immediately to assist with obtaining registration ownership change required for export, full workshop technical and safety inspection conducted by one of the most highly regarded ALFA Workshop’s in Johannesburg, and major service conducted.

It seems a “no brainer” really – but hey keep searching for that elusive bargain.   Or simply buy this car today.\nWe handle every aspect of the export procedure out of Cape Town, and the price shown includes every likely fixed and variable cost involved in the purchase and full import to the UK.   We can then at an extra charge – but warehouse storage free - do the MoT – even if exempt, get IVA certification – if required, DVLA, Black Plates, etc., for you – then come and drive her home.

{"name": "1976 ALFA ROMEO GT 1600 JUNIOR DELUX RHD 1976 - £31,800 ", "transmission": " MANUAL 5-SPEED", "mileage": " 57175 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "1976 Alfa Romeo “1600 GT JUNIOR” DELUX - South Africa ONLY\n\nThe ALFA ROMEO GIULIA 105/115 Series COUPÉs are a range of cars based upon the shortened floorpan from the same model range sister car, the GIULIA BERLINA (Saloon), \nThey were manufactured in Italy from 1963 until 1977, but CKD Assembly also took place for the RHD “Local Market” in South Africa.\nNotable, one third of all countries globally still drive RHD cars on the left side of the road, yet as an example of this range the official figures reveal that of the RHD with MPH-Speedo’s production in Italy - to serve the global requirement which included countries like Australia, Cypress, Malaysia, Malta, New Zealand, UK, et al, which were built to the identical specification under the same “Tipo Number” as the LHD cars – and only represented less than 3.5% of the total at best.   \nWhereas the huge popularity of ALFA ROMEO in the South African market meant these unique “Tipo Number for CKD-packs” (RHD with KPH-Speedo’s - South Africa adopted the metric system in 1970) represented 6.3% of the same overall manufactured total – almost double the demand in just one country.  Which is probably why so few RHD Non-CKD units remaining.   Throughout the 1960s until 1976 ALFA ROMEO range was CKD assembled at the Automakers Rosslyn Plant but post-1976 they opened their own BRITS Plant near Pretoria – and thereafter full manufacturing took place of all models until the financial problems of Alfa Romeo culminated in its sale to the FIAT Group in 1986, at which time the Brits Plant was closed.   This was and still is their only Plant ever located outside of Italy.\n\nThis superb ALFA ROMEO GT 1600 JUNIOR DELUX is one of only 200 “limited production” Type 115 Coupes built by ALFA ROMEO South Africa in its fanfare year of 1976/7. \nIt is identical to the GTV 2000 COUPE in appearance and specification but for the 1600 motor, conforming exactly to the specifications of the GTV 2000 RHD CKD model in terms of their interior finish & fittings, instrumentation, driveline, suspension, brakes, and rear lights.   AR-SA even continued in the use of the “GT-1600-Junior” boot badge, but it dropped the “Green Serpent” insignia on the C-Pillar.  These Coupes were supposed to also drop the front & rear bumper over-riders – but some owners had them retro-fitted “after-market”.   Apparently, this unique model was due to the impending launch of the ALFETTA GTV and BERLINA models, and the SA Plant were short-stocked of the 2000-engine to phase-out their body-in-white 115-shells - so put in the 1600 motor as their “swan song” of the much loved 115-Series using this unusual specification for their globally unique 1600 Junior Delux.\n\nThis SA-Only limited production is unlike the 1974 GT-1600-Junior and 1300, “rationalization” program with the GTV 2000 model at the Italian Plant - in essence only changed the front grille and headlamp layout and the rear light units.   \n\nThis Coupe is an original car “survivor” from this final batch, and currently with 4th owner. The car has been garaged its entire life and has a genuine 92,015km on the KLM odometer – this equates to 57,175 MLS.   Furthermore, it has always resided in the Johannesburg area of Guateng Province – meaning at high altitude of 2,000 metres, well above the escarpment and away from sea-level ozone bearing salt and high humidity, at least 570 klms (350-mls) inland, in a dry climate which only has a few hours of snow every ten years or so.   The point being is that if you buy a SA-based Classic car, make sure you know where it has spent its life.   You have been warned in the politest way!   \n\nWhen recently restoring the car, only the undercarriage components and all the mechanicals were required to be restored – although entire body including the stripped-out engine-bay had a respray in the original ex-factory body colour.   Notably, there was no rust that needed to be removed or panel replacement, and the entire underbody had been professionally sealed at the cost to the thoughtful 1st-Owner.  The interior – seats, dashboard, door-cards, kick-panels, seats, carpeting, and roof headlining are also original and in well-above average condition and therefore were re-installed.    All restoration or replacement of parts as required was conducted by a well-qualified and highly experienced Alfa Romeo trained Mechanic.  There is a file of 51-images showing this work in progress – I’ve included a few here.\n\nThere isn’t an inch of this car that has not been examined to ensure she is simply superb.\nThis car can be driven and enjoyed, without worrying about reliability or how soon you are going to face a very expensive cosmetic bodyshell restoration.  \n\nKindly remember; “The only cheap Classic Car to own is the most expensive one to buy”!\n\nThe Purchase Price of (GBP) £31,800 includes our Brokerage Fee, all of the Vehicle Transport Carrier charges as your newly acquired vehicle is never driven on SA public roads again, and always transported as required for all Export procedure Inspections and Certificates required. Also included for your peace-of-mind, the Certificates for a new (current) DEKRA RWC (Road Worthy Test and Certificate) which is on par to international standards, such as the TuV and MoT standards.

The basic body shape shared by all models was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro for BERTONE.   It was one of his first major projects for Bertone and borrowed heavily from his earlier design for the 2000 Sprint/2600 Sprint. The balance of glass and metal, the influence of the shape of the front and rear glass on the shape of the cabin, and the flat grille with incorporated headlights were groundbreaking styling features for the era.\n\tA limited production (1000 units) CONVERTIBLE was a modification from the standard car by CARROZZERIA TOURING of Milan, offered as a catalogue model by Alfa Romeo called the GIULIA SPRINT GTC.   A small number of the GT JUNIOR ZAGATO were also built with very different aerodynamic two-seater coupé body designed by ERCOLE SPADA for ZAGATO Coachbuilders of Milan.  These two were offered by Alfa Romeo as catalogue models, as the GT 1300 Junior Zagato and later GT 1600 Junior Zagato.\n\tAll models feature the four cylinder, all-light-alloy Alfa Romeo TWIN CAM engine in various cubic capacities being the models “GT 1300 Junior” (1290 cc) and “GTV 1750” (1779 cc) that later in 1972 was cylinder-bored for larger capacity, becoming the “GTV 2000” (1962 cc), all with two valves per cylinder.   Also, in 1972 a “GT 1600 Junior” (1570 cc) engine was launched - whereas previously the “GT Junior” was only available as a 1300 (1290 cc) model.  \n\tThe “GT Junior” cars all featured large 7” Carello headlamps with grille crossbars differentiating these two models – whereas the “GTV” models are fitted with dual-headlamps on each side of the grille feature of a larger 7” outer lamp with a smaller 5 ¾” inner lamp.   There was also a decidedly different design of the rear-light clusters fitted to the “GT Junior’s” to that of the GTV’s. \n\tFrom 1974 on, the GT 1300 Junior and GT 1600 Junior were rationalised into a common range of models with the 2000 GTV and were rebadged as 1.3 GT Junior and 1.6 GT Junior, sharing most of the interior and exterior features with the larger-engined GTV. The only exterior differences were no bumper over-riders, lack of C-pillar green serpent badges, small rear light clusters same as pre-'74 Juniors and the rebadging on the boot. Apart from the engine size, the only mechanical differences were smaller front brakes, as the Juniors had not adopted the larger units fitted to the 1750 GTV and 2000 GTV from 1968 on, differential ratios (Junior models 4.55:1, 2000 GTV 4.1:1) and 5th gear ratio (GT 1300 Junior 0.85:1, all other Alfa Romeo 105 models 0.79:1). \n\tAll “cc” versions of the engine fitted to the 105 series COUPÉS featured twin carburettors - except for US market 1750 GTV and 2000 GTV cars which were fitted with mechanical port fuel injection by SPICA.    Competition “GTA” models featured cylinder heads with twin spark plugs. \n\tCommon to all models was also a 5-speed manual transmission - although at Alfa Romeo’s Brits Plant in Rosslyn, South Africa a few GTV 2000 Automatic were made for the local market featuring the “ZF 3-Speed” automatic transmission – which was sluggish in performance.   Thankfully, the engineering team made retro-fitting a Manual 5-speed a relatively simple conversion to swap in the pressure plate and clutch – plus of course changing the driver’s footplate and installing a three-pedal arrangement and slave cylinder.\n\tAll models have solid disc brakes on all four wheels, and later models were fitted with dual-brake lines and two master servos.  The rear suspension uses a solid axle with coil springs, bump-stops, canvas strap travel limiters, and shock absorber dampers as standard.    \n\tA Limited Slip Differential and Factory Air Conditioning was available as options.\n\nA limited slip differential was standard on the GTV 2000 for North America 1972–1974.   \nFactory air conditioning was available on the 1973-1974 only in the USA.\n\n"}

All the handbooks are with the vehicle and there is a large paperwork file with every bill and receipt since new. In the last few years it’s main use has been to collect the family Christmas tree and occasional trips to the recycling centre, as the now elderly owners prefer to use their smaller car. I must be clear that this is very much a project car, it failed it's last MoT on parking, brake efficiency and the brake hoses will need attention. The front wings and bonnet require some attention or replacement but on the whole the structure is very sound. There are various age related marks around the vehicle. The electric sunroof has stopped working, but all the other electrical items appear to be fine. The interior, although it's in need of a clean is in good condition, the car also has the rare factory fitted 7 seat option. Even just moving it around the storage area where it’s kept, it drives beautifully with that lovely Mercedes solid feel that I’ve found sadly lacking in more modern examples I’ve owned. In an ideal world I would keep it and initiate the restoration, but other projects are higher up the list so reluctantly I’ve decided to sell it. Please bear in mind that this is not your typical multi owner worn smooth old Mercedes and is therefore priced accordingly. Viewing near Newbury in Berkshire."}

{"name": "1973 VOLKSWAGEN TYPE 2 DAY VAN - £POA ", "transmission": " 3-SPEED AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 74300 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Volkswagen introduced their ‘Type 2’ (the manufacturer’s second model) in 1950 and production ran in Germany until 1979, when the Type 3 model was introduced. Instantly recognizable to this day, they have achieved something of a cult status, given their widespread use during the ’60s and later, often associated with the surf culture from that decade. \n\nThe earliest models are referred to as ‘split screen’, referencing the windscreen style and the revised version – introduced in 1967 – the ‘bay-window’, similarly referencing a now altered windscreen design. In addition to this change, the second-generation vehicle was a little larger and heavier than the first variant; had revised suspension; 12-volt electrics and larger, more powerful engine options. In 1972, the flat-four engine was available in an enlarged 1.7 litre size, with a claimed 66 bhp available, driving through a 4-speed, manual transmission. Various cosmetic changes were also introduced in the early 1970’s, such as squared-off bumpers to meet US crash safety standards.\n\nThis 1973 late ‘bay window’ T2 was first sold as a micro-bus model in Los Angeles in the USA, where it has spent much of its life. In November 2013 it was imported to the UK as a solid, rust-free vehicle and purchased by a Guernsey resident the following year, who commissioned significant refurbishment and conversion work, including the fitment of a new, enlarged (1800 cc) engine and a new day van interior. The vehicle was then sold to a Jersey resident in 2021 and is currently still a Jersey-registered vehicle.\n\nThe new 1800 cc, twin-carb engine was fitted by specialist Dr V Dub of Portsmouth in 2019. This was at 71,000 miles recorded and the van has only covered a limited mileage since that time. \nOther mechanical upgrades carried out include:\n•\telectronic power steering from Lite-Steer\n•\tRed9 Design front wishbone suspension \n•\tVintage Speed exhaust system\n•\tengine bay fire extinguisher system and battery isolator from VW Aircooled Works\n•\tthe van has been fully rewired\n\nStarting from a sound basis with a good, imported body shell, the recent refurbishment work included a full respray in Pastel White over Niagara Blue and this remains in very good condition. Fuchs-type alloy wheels have been fitted. \n\nThe day van interior was fitted by Richard Booth Design, of Burton on Trent and includes an overhead locker. A full width VW Rusty Lee rock’n’roll bed has been installed together with a Mad-Matz cabby-box between the front seats. Kens Customs of Derbyshire renewed or refurbished the upholstery, headlining and dashboard as required. A modern retro-look stereo and MCJ Rosewood steering wheel have also been fitted. The interior of the vehicle is in excellent condition throughout.\n\nThis is a very smart and tidy day van camper with many quality components fitted by specialist VW suppliers. It is in excellent mechanical condition having covered only a limited mileage since an extensive refurbishment. With automatic transmission and power assisted steering it is a very easy vehicle to drive. \n\nThe car is currently Jersey registered and we can assist with shipping and importation processes if required.

This wasn't a speculatively purchased car on the basis of a dealer's description - I personally went to the States to view the car, confirmed it's excellent condition and imported it to the UK. I have an extensive history file for the car which contains all of the paperwork relating to the importation, title documents and receipts for spares installed and work carried out since. This is a matching numbers car on its original engine. The car has never been restored, it has never had any rot in any area and so the ash frame and the body panels are as assembled by MG - the ash frame is exceptionally strong compared to many other cars I viewed before purchasing this one. When I bought the car the vendor assured me the engine had recently been rebuilt, and although I have no proof of this it does run extremely well with excellent oil pressure both hot and cold. The gearbox is quiet with excellent synchromesh. The paint condition, while not concours, is good. The Red interior is excellent and original. The RHD dashboard and glove compartment door I made from a single plank of solid ash which together with its original Jaeger Chronometric speedometer and rev counter looks superb and will never suffer from veneer peeling. I carried out the RHD drive conversion using the correct new steering and brake parts in 2014 with receipts to prove provenance of all parts fitted. The car runs and drives perfectly. It has a totally unused Michelin XZX spare and 4 new ultra-low mileage Michelin XZX’s, Runyon luggage rack, new high torque starter, SU electronic fuel pump, water pump and thermostat, new radiator, new combined oil pressure and temperature gauge, spin on oil filter conversion, new stainless steel exhaust, new door hinges, new mohair hood, new sidescreens and tonneau cover (professionally fitted).

{"name": "1965 SUNBEAM TIGER MK1 - £59,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 14620 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Sunbeam Tiger – Carroll Shelby’s British fling. This superb example 1965 Mk1 Sunbeam Tiger, presented in Mediterranean Blue (code 100) with a black mohair hood and black interior is a delight to be seen on the roads by passers-by and most enjoyed behind the wheel. With only 300 said to be left on the UK roads, these cars are becoming more and more desirable as their shared characteristics with the AC Cobra shine through to create an outstanding partnership of British and American driving. This UK RHD example has been well cared for throughout its 58 years, with both the exterior and interior presenting in excellent condition.  It is clear the car does not lie in original paint, but the original colour has been preserved to a high standard. The brightwork presents very well and recent invoices display that the car has had new glass seals and bumper rubbers in 2020, and a new set of badges in 2022. The side chrome trims have been deleted, giving the car a more streamlined look. The car sits exceptionally on Minilite Mag style wheels giving this V8 powered sportscar the stance it deserves. To finish off the exterior, a new mohair hood has been fitted to defend its passengers against our volatile British weather. The interior of the car has had a similar level of upkeep and work to repair or replace any necessary items. The original seats and centre armrest have a number of age-related wear marks but no rips or tears. The wooden dash and original steering wheel present excellently with an original style preserved throughout the entire interior. The door cards have been replaced for new and a new set of carpets tidy up the look. The 260 cubic inch (4.3l) Ford V8 engineered to fit by Shelby into the Tiger body provides plenty of thrills. With 160bhp and a top speed of 120mph powered at the rear wheels, the Ford V8 provided quick acceleration coupled to the already impressive handling and braking abilities of the Sunbeam Alpine. With disc brakes on the front, independent front suspension and a live axle at the rear, the Tiger can handle the power and cornering is \"let’s say\" exciting.

Despite numerous other acquired accolades, the goose that laid the golden eggs was clearly not plucked; on the contrary, the audience demanded for an encore, and in 1991, it was granted, when the Testarossa was succeeded by the 512 TR.\n\nWhile its predecessor, the Testarossa, seemed to flirt with the boundaries of perfection, the 512 TR took it a step further. The powertrain remained almost identical to the previous one, which also reveals the traditional Ferrari model name: 'TR' standing for Testa Rossa, referring to the iconic red cylinder head; '5' signifies the five-litre engine displacement; '12' represents the twelve horizontally mounted cylinders in a flat, boxer arrangement located in the middle of the vehicle, just like in the Testarossa. However, thanks to a higher compression ratio, the 512 TR managed to produce almost forty more horsepower, resulting in higher torque at higher RPMs. The manual gearbox, which guarantees a rush of happiness-inducing hormones upon operation, is mounted lower and has been overall improved. The gearbox was, in fact, sometimes a sensitive point with the Testarossa. It's clear that Ferrari aims to elevate even the best to a higher level; ‘the sky is the limit’.\n\nThe 512 TR is the ideal Testarossa, boasting a design that is somewhat more modern than the Testarossa's, exuding a '90s vibe. The prancing horse emblem now adorns the rear center, the pop-up headlights are retained, the front bumper is painted to modern standards, and they move away from the extensive use of plastic that was seen before. The wheels also undergo a rework, and inside, the focus is on making the sporty seats more ergonomic.\n\nThe Ferrari 512 TR was produced until 1994, marking a bold step toward a modern era for Ferrari. After 2261 units were manufactured, the 512M was revealed, which in turn brought more modern innovations. The ranks of Ferrari classics are now rightfully joined by the 512 TR, and its value is firmly on the rise.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 448 (176 inch)\nWidth (cm): 198 (78 inch)\nHeight (cm): 114 (45 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 255 (100 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1473 (3247 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: V12 4943 cc mid-engine\nValve gear: 48\nFuel system: Bosch Motronic\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 422 hp (315 kW) at 6750 t/m\ntorque: 491 Nm at 5500 t/m\nTop speed: 314 km/h (194 mph)"}

{"name": "1973 JAGUAR E-TYPE SERIES 3 V12 - €99,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Beautiful bicolour in two shades of red\nBelgian car\nEarly hour Series 3\nAvant-gardist and futuristic design, both inside and outside\n \n\nThe Jaguar E-Type - released in a trilogy and often nicknamed in the US as ‘Jaguar XK-E’ - left every petrol head baffled from its initial release in 1961 until the end of production in 1974. The sleek and aerodynamic design has stark resemblances to the design of jet planes. Underneath the hood there’s a performant engine which emphasizes those resemblances. These two aspects have become Jaguar’s trademark which makes their cars coveted with classic car enthusiasts.\n\nMalcolm Sayer was the aeronautic engineer who designed the E-Type, his inspiration came from the design of jet planes. Inspiration which he very successfully converted to making an icon in the automobile sector. The distinguished result was: a long prow, a short rear and a long and wide body made of monocoque steel which visually emits prestige and power. Enzo Ferrari once pronounced the XK-E to be the most beautiful car ever made.\n\nBeside the E-Type’s aesthetic perfection there’s obviously also the performance. Initially, this British flagship came flat floor and equipped with a 3.8L in-line-six engine. Co-operating with three SU carburettors, the engine produces not less than 265 hp. In 1964 de Series 1 was upgraded enginewise: the engine capacity rose to 4.2L. In 1971, the Series 3 was released, the new engine - 5.3L V12 - jeopardized its competitors even more. That Series 3 reached speeds up to 241 km/h, which made it one of the fastest cars on the road.\n\nGroundbreaking technology also wasn’t something Jaguar missed out on, they engineered four-wheel disc brakes and the four-speed manual gear box made this coupé even safer and easier to handle. The classy mahogany gear stick and steering wheel strengthen a certain feeling of safety and moveability.\n\nDuring the past decades, and still, the E-Type has remained a prestige-emitting car. Obviously, this car has won several awards and they seem not to lose their value soon. Car enthusiast from all over the globe have been coveting this car.\n\nSeries 3:\n\nThe E-Type Series 3 brought the 5.3L V12 engine to life. This version was manufactured from 1971 until 1974 and even though it was cheaper than its competitors, there was some groundbreaking technology involved again as powered steering and wheel cases became standards. The Series 3 was made as a two-seat convertible, two-seat coupe and 2+2 coupe, however the two-seat coupe was taken out of production early on.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 469 (185 inch)\nWidth (cm): 168 (66 inch)\nHeight (cm): 123 (48 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 267 (105 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1565 (3450 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 5344 cc V12 front-engine\nValve gear: 24\nFuel system: 4 Zenith carburettors\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 272 hp (203 kW) at 5850 t/m\ntorque: 412 Nm at 3600 t/m\nTop speed: 238 km/h (148 mph)"}

Pininfarina were the ones to design this convertible car, they had already designed numerous other cars for other brands in, they were seasoned and they did excellent jobs.\n\nThe Spider was brought to the market in 1966, it carried the fame of Alfa Romeo’s Giulietta Spider, though it was a seperate and independent model, apart from the Giulietta. Initially, nobody would have ever expected a 27 year production run, but it was designed by Pininfarina himself, Battista Pininfarina, making it needless to say that this car was a bull’s eye to the market. Unfortunately, the famous designer passed away in 1966, making it the very last car he designed.\n\nUnder the hood, you would always find a four-cylinder engine originally delivering 109 horsepower. Over the years, the power was increased to a maximum of 135 horsepower, and the engine displacement grew from 1.6 liters to exactly two liters.\n\nThroughout the years, the unique design with a long hood and stretched rear end underwent several revisions and modernizations, but the core Pininfarina designed remained the same: modest dimensions, a tailor-made engine, together creating a driving experience that felt very pleasant and sporty, as usual with Alfa Romeo’s cars.\n\nAlfa Romeo Spider 3\n\nIn 1983, the Spider was updated for the second time to keep the car well-performing and attractive in now modern times. As mentioned before, the core design remained the same, rubber bumpers were added to the front and rear, a spoiler found its place in the conventional rear-wing spot. A Bosch injection system was now installed, ensuring a smoother-running engine. In 1986, the Spider 3 received a sporty makeover with an optional sports package that included sportier rims, a sprayed hardtop, sleeker bodywork on the doors, and a leather interior. In 1990, a succeding fourth generation was released and would be manufactured until 1993.\n\nThe charming design resembled previous Alfa Romeo models but was contemporarily designed to meet the 80s car trends and market demands. The Spider 3 is an accessible classic car that appeals to a wide audience.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 425 (167 inch)\nWidth (cm): 163 (64 inch)\nHeight (cm): 129 (51 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 225 (89 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1161 (2560 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 1962 cc four-cylinder front-engine\nValve gear: 8\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 126 hp (94 kW) at 5400 t/m\ntorque: 178 Nm at 4200 t/m\nTop speed: 197 km/h (122 mph)"}
{"name": "1983 CITROEN 2CV 6 SPECIALE - €10,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Easy to maintain and uttermost accessible\nCitroen in its best form\nAll time classic\nVintage look\n6 Speciale: 602 cc engine edition made from 1979 to 1983\n \n\nThe 2CV had it blueprints already prepared before WWII began and this TPV (Toute Petite Vehicle) was to be presented at the 1939 Paris Auto Show. Due to the impending war, that Paris Auto Show was cancelled. Citroen's plans and prototypes for the 2CV were stored away and hidden. Literally hidden because the decision was made to store the prototypes in haystacks in the factory so that the Nazis would not be able to find them. Prototypes were also distributed by train throughout Europe so that the Nazis would not steal this beautiful 2CV idea.\n\nIn October 1948, four years post-war, the car was finally presented at the Paris Auto Show as a TPV (‘Toute Petite Vehicule’, which is French for Small Vehicle) and launched on the market. Pierre-Jules Boulanger, the 2CV’s spiritual father appointed by Michelin, had the clear goal in mind to produce a cheap, light, fuel-economical, and above all, simplistic car that fits the demands of countryside people. Citroen’s marketing research showed that there were several criteria to be added: the car had to accommodate two people, mainly farmers, and fifty kilograms of potatoes or a fifty-litre barrel of wine. Rumour has it Citroen also wanted the car to accommodate two farmers and a sheep in the car, or even that it had to be able to move a basket filled with eggs on and off-road, on the bumpy and freshly plowed field, without breaking a single egg. To achieve that goal, Citroen devised a simple yet ingenious system that ensures the car to balance itself. When pressure is applied to one side of the wheelbase, the other side of that wheelbase automatically lengthens, that system was named built-in mechanical levelling. Even though the 2CV is not sporty at all, this car is able to take turn at an incredibly high speed without tilting over.\n\nThe 2CV was built from 1949 to 1990, during this period, the same line was maintained. The 'goat,' as it is known in Belgium, remained the same recognizable car for 42 years. This continuity emphasizes the sublime design that perfectly meets market demand. Nearly six million units of the 'duck,' as it is known in the Netherlands, were built in various finishes. For example, an off-road version was introduced under the name 2CV 4x4 Sahara, a 2CV with two engines, two gearboxes, and two fuel tanks. Citroen also introduced an intended successor to the market under the name Citroen Dyane. As the Dyane did not affect the sales of the 2CV, Citroen decided to continue production of the 2CV. Not too many variants were designed, this car was already as amazing as it could get.\n\nNothing can subvert the 2CV’s fame and popularity. Even today, the 2CV remains a very popular classic car that holds its value and it is so ingenious in the simplest way possible which makes it a very sustainable and almost undestroyable classic.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 383 (151 inch)\nWidth (cm): 148 (58 inch)\nHeight (cm): 160 (63 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 240 (94 inch)\nWeight (kg): 585 (1290 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: boxer-twin 602 cc front-engine\nValve gear: 4\nFuel system: 1 Solex carburettor\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: FWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 29 hp (21 kW) at 5750 t/m\ntorque: 39 Nm at 3500 t/m\nTop speed: 115 km/h (71 mph)"}

{"name": "2001 PORSCHE 911 996 GT2 - €150,000 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 61342 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Paint carefully checked and in mint condition\nComes with complete maintenance booklet and informational booklets\nManually geared Porsche power at its finest\nPorsche’s flagship\nThe Porsche 911 is the exception that proves the rule “to all good things comes an end”. This contemporary and luxurious, yet sporty, German sportscar was released in 1963. To this day, they are still being produced in large numbers, also a range of variants has been developed to mimic a tailor-made product range. Although the 911 has been refined over the decades, the basic design – which is recognisable and thus sublime – has generally remained unchanged. This pragmatic and contemporary approach only Porsche could ever succeed in.\n\nThe 911 is the successor to the Porsche 356 and was designed by Ferdinand Porsche - the grandson of Porsche’s founder – and presented at the Frankfurt Auto Show in the autumn of 1963. In 1964, the first models were delivered to customers, and due to its great success, the 911 was soon expanded: a cheaper 912, a faster 911S and the rollbar equipped and extremely safe convertible Targa were released. This Targa was named after a Sicilian race that was year by year won by Porsche.\n\nInitially, this car would be called the Porsche 901, but Peugeot became the headwind as their models were named by a three-digit number with a 0 in the middle. “Don’t worry”, said Porsche and they replaced the 0 with a 1. The Porsche 911 was born! After that, there was still Porsche cars built that were named with a three-digit number with a 0 in the middle, however those were exclusively intended for racing and circuit purposes, not for public roads.\n\nUndoubtedly, the 911 has been modified over the years; as durable a design may be, times change, and cars do too. Porsche has always been prepared for changes and innovation. They gradually increased the engine displacement, the power and the size. The biggest mechanical change was the transition from air cooled engines to water cooled engine. Water cooled engines ensure an evenly cooled engine, which results in uniform combustion. This results in lower consumption and less emission.\n\nPorsche 911 996\n\nThe Porsche 996 was built from 1997 to 2004, except for some sporty editions that continued production until 2005. The 996 marked a significant milestone for the 911 series as it was the first to feature a water-cooled engine instead of an air-cooled engine. Although this is what defines the 996 in history, it is fundamentally different from its predecessor, the 993. Porsche was determined to make a new-millennium-worthy sports car, emphasizing modernization. As a result, they designed a nearly entirely new 911 that differed starkly from the classic 911 design.\n\nPorsche 911 996 GT2\n\nPorsche would not be Porsche if they did not inject some track-ready power into their street-legal cars. With the 996 series, Porsche eagerly worked on a successor to the non-street-legal GT2 of the 993 series. As early as 1999, the idea of creating a new GT2 based on the 996 series was brought forward. The 996 GT2 was designed with a twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter 24-valve six-cylinder boxer engine, making it considerably more powerful than its predecessor. In less than four seconds, this powerful six-cylinder engine can propel the car from a standstill to a hundred kilometres per hour, absolutely astounding.\n\nGiven that the 996 was the first water-cooled 911, and the GT2 is the flagship model of the series, not to mention the fact that it's the first true homologated GT2, it's highly coveted. Enthusiasts remain captivated.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 445 (175 inch)\nWidth (cm): 183 (72 inch)\nHeight (cm): 128 (50 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 236 (93 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1440 (3175 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: flat-six twin-turbocharged intercooled 3600 cc rear-engine\nValve gear: 24\nFuel system: MPI\nGear box: 6-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 456 hp (340 kW) at 5700 t/m\ntorque: 620 Nm at 3500 t/m\nTop speed: 315 km/h (196 mph)"}
{"name": "1989 MINI 1000 - €7,350 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The perfect bicolour for a British car: British Racing Green and a white roof\nSporty look: viper stripes and twin-exhaust\nFor a real Mini aficionado\n \n\nThe Mini, a small car with a big story. In 1959, British car manufacturer British Motor Corporation (BMC) released the Mini, it is obvious that they had a clear goal in mind: releasing a small city-fit car with a cute design. Thanks to The Beatles and its starring in countless famous films, the car has acquired an iconic status over the decades.\n\nIt was Alec Issigonis, a British-Greek car designer that worked for BMC, who gave birth to the Mini. He had a clear goal in mind: to create an affordable and fuel-efficient car that is efficient and light-steering in narrow British city streets. This approach, along with the playful design, created a true hype among young people. The Mini also became extremely popular with influential people, to the point that all members of The Beatles - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr - proudly show off their Minis. In 1969, the car takes on the leading role in the film The Italian Job, in which bank robbers used a Mini as a getaway car. Also Mr. Bean’s car is a lime green 1977 Mini, which emphasizes his clumsiness in the best way possible.\n\nInitially, the Mini was manufactured in various finishes, such as a sedan, a station wagon, a van, and even a pickup truck. Those finishes never really became fancied among the crowd. Also, in the 1980s, the Mini began losing its fame due to fierce competition from other car brands. This caused a harsh financial crisis in 1986 at British Leyland - the former BMC that also own Jaguar, Rover, Triumph, and MG. They even decide to restructure and privatize the company and from that moment on Rover Group was born. In 1994, Rover Group sells Mini to BMW, which seven years later, in 2001, launch a refined version of the Mini. Nowadays BMW still produce the Mini – baring its British identity in mind – and it is available in various finishes: a convertible, a fully electric version, a hybrid version, a sports version, and even a station wagon.\n\nAs mentioned before, the goal was to build a city car that fit in traffic in cities, therefore they had to use as little space as possible, that was a real challenge in the middle of the 20th century. The 1950s are often considered a tipping point in automotive technology, and the Mini has contributed to that tipping point: a front-wheel drive car with a transverse and space-saving engine that is highly responsive and fit to city traffic.\n\nToday, the Mini is a coveted classic car, and not only among classic car enthusiasts. The cute and vulnerable design simply captures everyone's hearts.\n\nBritish Racing Green\n\nBritish Racing Green - dark green in various shades - is not just one of many colours for the English; it is inseparably linked to British roaring and fast racing cars, or, on the other hand, regular British city cars like for example a Mini. For years on end, it has been a tradition for the British to appear on the racing scene in this not-so-flashy, but undeniably British, colour. It is the quintessential British color, alongside the colours of the world-famous Union Jack.\n\nBritish Racing Green was first seen in 1903 when the British Races Selwyn Francis Edge won the influential Bennett Cup in 1902 and thus had the pleasure of organizing that race in his own country, the UK. In the UK, the legal speed limit at the time was 12 miles per hour - which is about 20 kilometres per hour - not exactly a speed for racing cars. That's why the race was instead organized in Ireland in 1903, and the British drivers expressed appreciation to the Irish by painting their cars in, you might have guessed it, dark green, derived from Irish green. Since then, ‘British Racing Green’ has become a term and it has acquired cult status in the following decades – and centuries? - even beyond the racetrack.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 305 (120 inch)\nWidth (cm): 141 (56 inch)\nHeight (cm): 135 (53 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 204 (80 inch)\nWeight (kg): 620 (1367 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: transversally mounted 998 cc straight-four front-engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: 1 SU carburettor\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: FWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 39 hp (29 kW) at 5250 t/m\ntorque: 68 Nm at 2600 t/m\nTop speed: 132 km/h (82 mph)"}

Every bush on the steering, suspension and exhaust were replaced with new silicone ones. New shock absorber all round, all brake lines replaced with new copper ones, the rear brake drums were overhauled and new brake calipers  and pads at the front. To complete the suspension overhaul new top and bottom ball joints were fitted. The engine a Pinto 1.6 ltr and was obviously a lower mileage one, flushed out and serviced with oil filter and new plugs. She ran a little hesitantly this was solved by fitting a new carburettor and at the same time a new cam belt. Water pump, starter motor, alternator and battery were fitted.

Up until the end of the S2c (pre-April 1972) the record reflects 106,639 Type 105.26 LHD versions were built – the Type 105.28 RHD versions are thought to have been an additional 7,728 units in total over this seven-year period.\n\tLet us concentrate on the S3 version which was produced from April 1972 until 1974 during which saw 105.26 LHD produce 18,087 units, while the 105.28 RHD saw 2,005 cars being produced.   This derivative saw several “major revisions” to the so-called “Unificata” unified body with the Super 1.3 in same period, which had a different series 105 suffix and not included in these 1600 production figures.

I may be biased but I think the styling is the best out of any SLKs (especially in this metallic Blue colour) and the supercharged 2.3L under the bonnet is more than punchy enough to have a lot of fun chucking around any public roadways in the UK. Personally I find this version of the SLK a really nice mixture of refinement and practicality for a 2-seat roadster when the roof is up (I use mine as my daily driver), as well as sporty fun at the weekends when the roof is down without destroying your back the rest of the time. And despite being 24 years old the car feels a lot more modern than it's age with electric wing mirrors, heated seats, and cruise/speed control. This is by no means a showroom-ready example, but as stated everything works as it should, and has plenty of motoring life left in it. Overall the car would make for a good cheap Summer roadster, or a candidate for a fully pristine restoration. I've tried to be as honest as possible in my appraisal of the car and am fully confident in it's ability to give the next owner a great experience, viewings and any additional questions are of course encouraged. I'm also open to a swap/px for a \"proper\" classic around the same value - i.e. early 80s or older. I'm looking for £2,500, based in Surrey/Lancashire.

The SL from that era represented the finest in engineering, comfort, and luxury in the 1970s and ’80s. Mercedes-Benz kept the model fresh and appealing throughout its 18-year run, catering to the expectations of its high-net-worth customers who ranged from industry tycoons to fashion moguls and movie stars.\n\nIn recent years the feasibility, charm, and prestige of the classic SL and SLC models have placed them as favourable choices with enthusiasts. Without question, this 1981 380 SLC coupe is one of the most pristine examples available. The car is one of just 3,789 built worldwide during a very brief 16-month production run. Furthermore, it is one of only 1,991 built for 1981. The SLC is thought to be the intelligent choice over the regular SL.\n\nDelivered on 27 March 1981 to its first proud owner via tourist delivery, this spectacular 380 SLC was the most expensive model offered by Mercedes-Benz at the time. Finished in Black over a rare and unusual European-only grey velour interior, the car presents in absolutely stunning condition today. Truly one of the best examples of the SLC anywhere, the car is simply immaculate, not only on the exterior but also the stunningly well preserved, special order Charcoal velour interior and underneath, the car presents like new. Even in the iconic rear quarter windows with the metal louvers which so often start to flake and crack on the surface, the louvers in this are as new too. You couldn’t wish to find a better example of an SLC anywhere, let alone the cost one would have to spend to get your average car to this standard. The original owner specified numerous options, including a sliding sun-roof, Becker radio, air-conditioning with climate control, and fog lamps. He would retain the SLC for over 25 years.\n\nToday the 380 SLC is accompanied with a host of its original accessories, including its original owner’s manual, maintenance books and delivery booklets. Furthermore, the car features its first-aid kit, original Dambach safety triangle, spare wheel, and tool roll with tools. Most recently, the car received a major service, including new fluids, filters, and spark plugs, on 16 December 2019 to the tune of nearly CA$4,500, for which the invoices are available on file.\n\nOffered with just 36,000 original miles (58,200 kilometres), making it also one of the lowest mileage cars available anywhere, this 380 SLC presents the opportunity to acquire a highly original example that would be suited for both touring and MBCA concours events. If you’ve always lusted after the idea of owning a “new” SLC, look no further because this is as close as you can get.\n\nNow available for viewing at the DD Classics Dealership (0208 878 3355) in London, please call for more information.\n\nEvery effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the above information but errors may occur.

{"name": "1971 MASERATI GHIBLI SS - €215,000 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "1 out of 425\nCollector’s item\nDefinitely one of Maserati’s most iconic cars\nSpacious luxury car\n \n\nThe Maserati Ghibli is a trilogy was ended twice with a cliff hanger. The third in the trilogy, thus the last in the series was only presented in 2013 and is still in production today. Its two eponymous predecessors were built from 1967 to 1973 and from 1992 to 1998. Maserati revealed with the first Ghibli in 1966 at the Turin Motor Show. Once again it was a typical Italian combination of a very powerful engine and a fashionable interior that was eye pleasing.\n\nThe first Ghibli was coded AM115, it is a two-seater designed by the seasoned designer Giorgetto Giugiaro. He designed the car to be aerodynamic and its shape resembles that of a shark. The pop-up headlights were for ahead of their time, being innovative. The interior is Italian, exceptionally fashionable. The car is powered by a powerful 4.9-liter V8 engine that produces 306 horsepower.\n\nAfter six years of Ghibli, Maserati decides to stop production and it was in the 90s that Maserati nostalgically looks back at its history and the beautiful Ghibli. They decide to restart an era. Based on the Biturbo’s predecessor, they decide to launch a new Ghibli. In 1992, the world was first exposed to a second version, with model code AM336. It was presented again at the Turin Motor Show. This time Marcello Gandini had the pleasure of designing the car, another seasoned designer who knew what to do. From 1992, the new Ghibli, based on the Biturbo, is equipped with a V6 engine that was considerably smaller in capacity with 2.0 litres, due to market demand. Also a larger 2.8L engine is designed for non-European markets. Despite the smaller engine, it did not disappoint, the 302 horses make the car accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometres an hour (0-60 mph) in less than six seconds. Approximately 2,500 examples of the car were built in total, and production was stopped in 1998.\n\nThe Ghibli did too well to be eternalised in discontinuity. In 2013 Maserati decide to make it a trilogy. At the Shanghai Auto Show, Maserati unveiled the M157, another Ghibli that pleased the crowd. This Ghibli was designed with a contemporary look, featuring the distinctive Maserati style. There was a range of engines available: a 3.0L biturbo V6 engine, a 3.8L V8 diesel engine, or a monoturbo 3.0L V6 engine. The engine was handled by an automatic eight-speed transmission. As of writing, the M157 has been in production for an exact decade, and Maserati doesn't seem to have any plans in discontinuing it.\n\nMaserati Ghibli SS\n\nThe Ghibli SS was revealed in 1969 and is therefore part of the first Ghibli edition. True to tradition, it is once again a stunningly designed car with an impressive engine architecture. Under the hood, there is a powerful V8 engine that almost hits the 5.0-liter engine capacity boundary. The engine produces 330 horsepower, a power output that left jaws dropping at that time.\n\nOnly 425 models of the Ghibli SS were sold and manufactured in total. This limited production quantity contributes to the soaring value of this Ghibli SS. The Ghibli SS combines the elegance of a beauty with the power of a beast. It is a collector's item for enthusiasts who are guaranteed to be left speechless.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 468 (184 inch)\nWidth (cm): 179 (70 inch)\nHeight (cm): 116 (46 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 255 (100 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1350 (2976 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: naturally aspirated 4930 cc V8 front-engine\nValve gear: 16, DOHC\nFuel system: 4 Weber carburettors\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 330 hp (246 kW) at 5500 t/m\ntorque: 481 Nm at 4000 t/m\nTop speed: 257 km/h (160 mph)"}
{"name": "1982 ALFA ROMEO GTV6 2.5 V6 12V COUPE RHD TIPO 116.37 1982 - £29,700 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 138518 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "1982 Alfa Romeo GTV6 2.5V6 12v Coupe (RHD) (Tipo.116.37)\nThis must be ALPHA (pun) month because I’m advertising two virtually identical model GTV6 Coupes amongst several others – so please be sure about which one you would like to enquire after.   This example has also had two owners from new, and again is still in a rust-free condition, having from new in the above escarpment region of the Free State – with the semi-arid, ozone and humidity free, environment.   Anyone who tries to say that cars don’t rust in South Africa simply doesn’t know what they are talking about – period!  She is now with her second owner – one of my classic car collector clients – who ironically has his farm only a few hundred kilos’ away across the Eastern Cape border.  \n \nHere, again the car enjoys constant attention being lavished upon her, is used sparingly but driven, kept clean and properly stored, taking pride of place among his Mercedes Benz collection.   It goes without saying that this is a mandated sale on his behalf.   When a car in the collection isn’t a Mercedes Benz, he only buys those cars from the previous owners who have been friends for many years, and he knows how they treated their cars. Often this is to ensure that they get a decent return on their investment.  \nHaving retired from Sheep Farming a few years back, he is now starting up with a Beef herd, so several of his “other marques” and a few duplications in his MB-collection are being thinned out – luckily for the future owners as they are all lovely examples.\n\nThis GTV6 was produced during 1982 at the Alfa Romeo Plant in South Africa.  If you’re very observant you will probably notice the difference in the seat upholstery pattern / colour – this is due to a “running-change” in line with the whatever applicable Alfa Romeo Plant in Italy, and nothing sinister about it.\n\nWhat else is there to know??? Okay, she is original to the highest degree apart from the notable fact that she sports a special performance exhaust made by none other than Dawie DeVilliers (renowned racing driver and privateer team owner of the legendary GTV6 3.0 Homologation - an example is also advertised on this site) at his workshops in Midrand.  Furthermore, “Oom Dawie” personally also regularly services and tunes this “Honey” for high-altitude performance.   \n\nThese ALFAs love the open road, albeit with only 1358,518 klms on her odometer – some 86,071 miles – clocked once on the 5-digit reading, but correct, which is extremely low considering the distances that are normally driven in South Africa.\n\nOther facts, she came new with the factory options of Air-Con, Electric Windows (front), and her still fitted OEM Alloy Wheels.   The relatively current SONY Radio/CD deck is shown upside down in the image (don’t know why).  She also appears to have an Anti-Theft Alarm system fitted – see the old-fashioned lock above rear bumper on the right rear corner.  Has her original books in AR-Pouch and tyre changing tools with Spare wheel.\n\nAre you searching for a brilliant condition, unmolested, unrestored, but superb original Alfa GTV6 of the 1980 era – that must be rust-free, never welded, and has an accident-free history, then this might be the right solution!   And it’s a genuine ex-factory RHD car!\nWe handle every aspect of the export procedure out of Cape Town, and the price shown includes every likely fixed and variable cost involved in the purchase and full import to the UK.   We can then at an extra charge – but warehouse storage free - do the MoT, even if exempt, get IVA certification – if required, DVLA, Black Plates, etc., for you – then come and drive her home.   Or we can deliver by transporter to your home – again for a charge dependent upon distance.\n\nLife is not a rehearsal!   If you want it, love it, need it, can afford it – why procrastinate!\n\nWe only sell the finest ALFA ROMEO Cars, Coupes, and Spiders – lets have a chat soon.\n"}

This is a regrettable sale of my lovely and very original Morris Minor Metropolitan Police car. I have lovingly fettled this Minor back to it's working clothing to get it to look as close as possible as to when it was in service back in the day. The car has only ever had two previous owners, me being the third and has an incredibly low mileage for it's age of only 63,000 miles and can be verified with the large amount of MoT's and paperwork the car comes with. I have fitted a period correct Police radio, this is not connected so can't be used. I have constructed the roof light box as close as possible as to what was used in the 1970s by the Met, the Police decals down the side have been reproduced copying the size and position as on the Morris Minor police car at the Met Police museum in Sidcup, Kent. I have fitted a light inside the roof box but have not connected to the cars electrics but would be easy to do if you so wished. I have fitted an appropriate audible alarm to the car, this can be switched on and off at will and can be use as a warning if the ignition switch is turned on. I have tried to keep the interior as original as possible, even down to the patched up drivers seat probably damaged by some burly copper in the day, also still retains it's original seat belts. The headlining is in great condition with the large zip still working great. As this was a Police car it still retains it's original poverty spec door cards, just flat Black vinyl. The bodywork is in great condition, on top and underneath, has had welding in the past but all looks to be done correctly and is very solid. The floors inside are in great condition, very solid and dry. As like most Morris Minors, the brakes are not great but adequate.

Not only being, at the time, the most capable high performance GT model Aston Martin had produced, with 510bhp, a stiffer chassis and carbon ceramic brakes providing awesome stopping power, but also the DBS was to play a starring role in ‘Casino Royale’, the 007 movie that provided Daniel Craig his debut as our favourite secret agent, firmly putting the model on the map and providing dealers worldwide with full order books at launch.\n\nAston Martin went on to build just over 2,500 DBS’ with the model having just about the highest black /grey / silver score of any Aston Martin ever, with 72% being built in these colours before production ceased in 2012. This particular DBS is finished in the very rare ‘Fast Track’ colour of Midnight Blue, just 1 of 8 UK right hand drive DBS’ to be finished in the colour and interestingly, the only example to have been built with an all Phantom Grey interior, therefore it being a ‘One of One’.\n\nThis 2011 model year example was first registered in November 2010, in 2+2 seating and Touchtronic II specification. In addition to the usual luxurious specifications of the DBS, which includes Bang & Olufsen Beosound audio system, Dynamic stability control (DCS) and Adaptive Damping System (ADS) optional extras chosen on this example include; Full length Piano Black fascia trim, Alarm upgrade Volumetric + Tilt Sensors, auto dim interior rear view mirror, DBS headrest logo, and 10 spoke Diamond Turned Silver wheels.\n\nPurchased by its last, enthusiast owner from Aston Martin Cambridge in 2011, servicing has been carried out, annually by the same agents with our own workshops carrying out the last two services, most recently in June of this year. Having now thoroughly prepared the car for sale, we can confirm that its condition is of the highest order, throughout. The paintwork being virtually unmarked and the interior displaying only the lightest evidence of any wear.\n\nSupplied with an extensive history folder, containing previous purchase invoice, servicing receipts and MOT certificates along with a custom fit Aston Martin car cover, Aston Martin umbrella and battery conditioner.\n\nWith the best DBS examples now being highly sought after by the Aston Martin enthusiast community, with many suggesting that the purposeful yet timeless styling of the model thus far to be bettered, we would go as far as saying that now is the perfect ‘Time to Buy’ one of these future classics!

This Mk1 Interceptor has been cherished by its former owners, having all work necessary to keep this beautiful car on the road today. The exterior of the car is in great condition throughout with no rust or rot. Presented in Crimson, the car was previously off the road from 2001-2007 whilst undergoing restoration. The lower six inches of the body was replaced, and a complete respray was undertaken including most of the chrome work which was refinished as well as a new black vinyl roof. Complete with all badges and original wheels, the car upholds its position as a fantastic example of this iconic British classic. The interior, finished in black leather is in excellent condition throughout. The enthusiasm of previous owners’ pampering is once again evident here. The cabin-space of the Mk1 Interceptor is elegantly designed with a wealth of gauges and switches surrounded by wooden trim. The car also includes its factory original Voxson 8 track. The Chrysler built 383c.i. (6.3l) V8 engine produced a modest 270bhp providing adequate power and accompanying soundtrack. This power is driven through a TorqueFlite automatic gearbox delivered by a limited slip differential onto the road. The gear changes are smooth, power-steering is functioning perfectly, suspension has no creaks or knocks, and braking is effective; this grand tourer certainly delivers an outstanding level of comfort. Within the engine bay are a number of modifications that are only improvements to the driving of this Interceptor including uprated dual Volkswagen electric fans and FBO electronic ignition providing increased reliability and comfort of use. With thanks to Steph Holloway, I can provide a link to the episode of idriveaclassic starring this particular Jensen Interceptor - https://youtu.be/FVwSrZuqNZ4 Overall, this Mk1 Interceptor is a fantastic example of a classic that had such a dominant impact on luxury British motoring of the era. If this car looks and sounds like the car for you a trip to our showroom is well worth the visit - our coffee pot is always hot."}

It’s powered by the legendary Motorsport Division S50 3.2 litre 6 cylinder 316hp engine as fitted to an E36 M3, driving through ZF 5-speed transmission, and with a limited slip differential. \nThe most significant body difference between a standard Z3 and a Z3 M are the flared rear wings to accommodate the extra-wide rear rims, but the front and rear valances and quad exhausts give the game away too.\n\nUsual very high specification – air conditioning, power hood, seats, windows, 17in alloys, heated seats, BMW radio/CD, central locking. \n\nThis one is also fitted with an uprated PowerFlow rear exhaust system, although we have the originals with it. \n\nWe also have the hood cover and wind deflector, plus a genuine BMW hardtop in blue. \n\nAs above, this one has covered just 23000 miles in the hands of just 2 owners from new, and comes with history including the original purchase invoice, original BMW service book with BMW main dealer stamps to 13561m, and a selection of bills and old MOT’s back to 2006. Last serviced at 22578m including a brake fluid change, and we’re told all 4 tyres have no more than 300 miles on them. \n\nWe have the original book pack etc\n\nIt will be suppled with a fresh 12M MOT and 6 months warranty on sale. \n\nIt is in truly exceptional condition in my opinion (as befits it’s low mileage)  and drives superbly, with an excellent 6-cylinder soundtrack that’s quite addictive. \n\nOn our own website, you’ll find our usual 2 videos – a comprehensive walkaround appraisal, and driving impressions, which form part of the description\n\nviewing by prior appointment\n"}

The engine and gearbox is really good and strong, starts first time every time. It's the reason why we didn't want to part with the car and bought it back in 2015. Cat D back in 2015 due to a person driving into/out of a parking space and caused superficial damage to the door. We decided to buy back and respray the whole car (see pics before and after). However the last few years it's just been SORNED or not driven much. You will see this if you check the MoT history. However it is still driven so mileage will increase slightly. Bare in mind, this is now a 27 year old car. Unfortunately, the bad part, the car is in need of some TLC, body work needs touch up here and there. Dent on the rear. Rear offside door has recently jammed shut. Steering wheel stitching has come undone. This has been a fantastic car and will be sad to see it go."}

There has only been a total of 500 of these vehicles ever produced, commissioned by BMC’s chairman Sir Leonard Lord, making them a true collectors’ car. But that's not all – we believe that only six others currently remain, with this example being the most original in existence worldwide, making it a great opportunity to own a rare gem. The car has the same 2639cc engine as the Austin Healey, it’s a 4-speed manual, fitted with factory overdrive. A UK right hand drive offered in it's original specification, including it's factory-fitted, period radio. It comes with Vanden Plas features such as Whitewall tyres, walnut dashboard and door trims, cloth headlining and is finished with a luxury thick pile carpet. The car would benefit from a small amount of TLC to reach it's true potential. The bodywork shows no signs of corrosion and the interior has been very well looked after. The paintwork has oxidised slightly, which is to be expected from it's age. Unfortunately, the car had a speedometer change from 21,000 to 28,000 miles in 2017. However, the mileage has been documented. The driver’s side rear panel appears to look slightly glossed compared to the rest of the body, but no paperwork supports any of the panels having been replaced. This car would suit both types of buyers, whether that’s someone that would like to just polish, or someone who is looking to do some refurbishments to suit their own taste. The car is complete with two sets of keys and is supplied with the Austin maintenance service booklet. It also comes with a comprehensive service history with MoT certificates dating back to 1973. There are only two former keepers displayed on the V5c registration book. The car is also supplied with a large amount of period literature, to include the original Austin driver’s handbook, maintenance instruction book, Vanden Plas sales brochure, service parts list and lubrication charts."}

It was revealed in Alfa Romeo’s booming sixties, and by revealing the 1750 GTV, they stepped up their game even more. For five years, and longer, it drove many people who loved some sportiness in their car absolutely crazy.\n\nA sports car for those who wanted that bit more, that is what Alfa Romeo got in mind when creating the 1750 GTV. The result is something to admired, and it has become an icon in the world of classic cars. The engine purrs beautifully, evoking nostalgic feelings, like travelling through the magnificent Italy of the '60s or '70s. The interior is a harmony of leather and wood accents. The leather seats are finished exquisitely, a fine steering wheel is installed, there was an endearing dashboard that exudes Italian character and a wooden gear stick that guarantees pleasure. Shifting gears with an Alfa Romeo is truly enjoying, aficionados are addicted to it.\n\nInitially, the 1750 GTV was equipped with a 1.8-liter straight-four engine. In 1971, the engine was upgraded to 2.0 liters, and the name had to be adjusted to ‘2000 GTV’ to match the engine displacement. The 1750 GTV was from then on known as the 2000 GTV. Both versions are highly sought after by a many, especially rally enthusiasts. The 1750 GTV is a beloved rally car, on one hand, the 'V' stands for Veloce, which in Italian means 'fast.' On the other hand, it is the feather-light weight of this car that allows it to effortlessly behave like a true rally beast.\n\nFor the design of this rally beast, that is at the same time adorable, Alfa Romeo turned to the renowned Bertone who eagerly put their expertise into it, as usual.

The Z8 was built to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary 507, and although that 507 nearly spelled trouble for the Bavarian ‘car magicians’, it still is a car that holds a prominent place in the BMW history books as 'iconic.' That same thing is exactly what the Z8 also claims on its list of accomplishments. The 'Z' stands for 'Zukunft', which means 'future' in German, its sleek design proves that it is a very correct name.\n\nAfter revealing flashy prototypes at international auto shows and making some refinements to the design of those revealed prototypes, it was time to unleash the Z8 onto the market. In 1999, the Z8 officially goes into production, the following year it was available for sale, marking the beginning of the new millennium in an extravagant manner. Equipped with the most powerful BMW engine of that time - a naturally aspirated V8 engine from the E39 M5 operated by a manual gearbox - the Z8 has a maximum power output of 400 horsepower and a maximum torque of 500 Nm. With these specifications, it is able to reach a speed of 100 kilometers per hour – 62 miles per hour - from a standstill in less than five seconds. Its top speed it electronically limited at 250 kilometres per hour.\n\nIn addition to its powerful engine, the Z8 offers plenty of luxurious features. There is no option list as the Z8 is a complete package on its own that comes with all the options. Therefore, the interior is fully made in leather, even the roll bar has the leather finish, there is an aluminium-finished steering wheel, the rear window of the hardtop is heated and matches the interior colours, and there even is a button to start and stop the engine.\n\nIt goes without saying, after seeing this car, that the automotive artistry of the Z8 offers architectural beauty in every way. The Z8 is entirely made of aluminium and completely crafted by hand using a new body construction technique called the ‘spaceframe’. Besides that, new-designed neon lights were also used for the Z8’s lighting.\n\nIts appearance in the 1999 James Bond film 'The World is Not Enough' gave it a boost in popularity and cemented its iconic status even before the Z8 hit the market. During its production period from 2000 to 2003, a total of only 5,703 units were built, each one meticulously handmade. The Z8 embodies a holy trinity of rarity, German natural power, and (near-)perfect design, which is why it has captured the hearts of many.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 437 (172 inch)\nWidth (cm): 183 (72 inch)\nHeight (cm): 132 (52 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 250 (98 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1635 (3605 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: V8 4941 cc front-engine\nValve gear: 32\nFuel system: Bosch Motronic\nGear box: 6-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 400 hp (294 kW) at 6600 t/m\ntorque: 500 Nm at 3800 t/m\nTop speed: 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited)"}

Also called \"Grey Ghost\" or \"Hiroshima\". In 1989, the Suzuki Intruder and Honda Shadow were introduced in America. Harley wanted to respond to this Japanese invasion with a new model designed by Willy G. Davidson. With Pearle Harbor in mind, Harley \"threw a bomb on the competition with this bike\" in 1990. The name Fatboy is a contraction of the atomic bombs called \"Fatman\" and \"LittleBoy\", which were dropped on Nasaki and Hiroshima. The name of the engine was not intended to trigger a riot, but rather to refer to an event in history. The emblem of the fatboy's tank closely resembles the symbol of the U.S.A.F. The wheels are very similar to those of the B-29 superfortress bombers; the planes carrying the two atomic bombs. Hiroshima: August 6, 1945: Paul Tibbets flies the Little Boy uranium bomb aboard the B-29 \"Enola Gay\" bomb in Hiroshima and drops the bomb 9500 m above the city. The bomb has a force of 15,000 tons of TNT. Nagasaki: August 9, 1945: the B-29 \"bockscar\" bomber with Captain Charles Sweeney and with the Fat Man plutonium bomb embark en route to Kokura: an industrial city of war. Due to a lot of clouds, they deviate after three aborted calls to a second target: Nagasaki. On August 12, Emperor Hirohito decided to surrender. Harley Davidson made bomb cases during World War II. The bomb cases were silver and were painted with 7 striking yellow/gold rings: symbol for the 7 continents. The engine has seven yellow rings: 1 on the contact button, 1 on the primary inspection cover, 2 on the tank in the tank emblems, 2 on the cylinder heads, 1 on the primary cabinet cover. Soon after, several governments spoke out against Harley Davidson's gloomy design. The name Fatboy still exists, but the silver color and yellow rings were no longer allowed to be used. Harley stopped production of the silver Fatboy at a number of about 1400. The Grey Ghost was never officially introduced in Europe. This bike has become a real collector's item, especially because of the story this bike wants to tell: Don't play with Harley Davidson!!    \n\nThis motorcycle was delivered new to the United States where it had 2 owners shortly after the other in 1992, then it was brought to Belgium where it was supplied with a Belgian COC and registration documents, it has been in the hands of the current owner since 2008 and, completely in its original condition."}

The series was built from 1968 to 2019, and the abbreviation stands for ‘eXperimental Jaguar’, which explains much of the cars’ uniqueness. Over the decades, the XJ series had a range of different model codes and names, often based on the splendid engine configuration. In addition to offering ‘ordinary luxury’, Jaguar decided to offer ‘supreme luxury’ under its subsidiary brand, Daimler.\n\nJaguar XJ Series III\n\nAs the name suggests, the XJ Series III is the third evolution of Jaguar's XJ series. This third evolution, introduced in 1979, brought a fresh breeze to Jaguar's XJ lineup. The roofline was elegantly ‘Italianized’ and designed by Pininfarina, while the lights, bumpers, and wheels also underwent slight modifications to modernize the appearance. What remained unchanged, and rightfully so, were the engines. People had the choice of a 3.4-liter or 4.2-liter straight-six or a whopping 5.3-liter V12 engine.\n\nThe XJ Series III served as a transitional model while enthusiasts awaited the almost entirely new XJ40. Facing financial trouble, Jaguar and its parent company British Leyland relied on the Series III to heal the financial wounds. It succeeded admirably, approximately 130,000 models sold. Initially regarded as a somewhat derogatory ‘transitional model’, it goes down in history as ‘Jaguar's guardian angel’. The Series III with the V12 engine was even available until 1992.\n\nDaimler Double-Six Series III\n\nDaimler is the British brand that assisted giving birth to the first modern motorcycle and the first gasoline engine ever. Their core business was producing cars for people who would settle for nothing but the best, resulting in luxury and prestige associated that was never seen before. Today, it is the longest British automotive brand in existence and has been adopted several times, including by Jaguar.\n\nJaguar wanted to equip the XJ Series III with a Daimler badge. The V12 version was considered luxurious enough to bear the Daimler badge, so not many modifications were made. However, the name had to sound meaningful and have a significant origin, ‘Double-Six’ was chosen, referring to powerful engines of the same name that Daimler had developed in the twenties.\n\nThe Double-Six Series III is constructed so innovatively that it doesn't reveal its age. It is a car for those who appreciate British elegance with true Jaguar V12 power under the hood. A remarkable classic.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 496 (195 inch)\nWidth (cm): 177 (70 inch)\nHeight (cm): 138 (54 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 287 (113 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1930 (4255 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 5343 cc front-engine V12\nValve gear: 24\nFuel system: Lucas-Bosch EFI\nGear box: 3-speed automatic\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 262 hp (196 kW) at 5000 t/m\ntorque: 393 Nm at 3000 t/m\nTop speed: 226 km/h (140 mph)"}
{"name": "1988 PEUGEOT 205 RALLYE 1.3 GROUP - £18,750 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 167453 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "1988 Peugeot 205 Rallye 1.3 Group A/N\n\nAt the beginning of 1987, the Peugeot 205 GTI 1.6 and 1.9 had been selling like hotcakes since their successive launches in 1984 and 1986, when information began to be revealed in the press concerning the forthcoming marketing of a 205 \"Rally\". This more economical model would not be part of the GTI line, but would be positioned just below the 1.6 version with 115 hp. It would take the place of the 105 hp 1.6 version which had just been withdrawn from the Peugeot catalogue. At that time, there was too much of a gap between the real GTI sports cars and the more muscular models of the classic 205 range, namely the GT and XT versions which had a power of barely 80 hp. For this intermediate model, it is also a question of finding a high-performance engine with a displacement of less than 1.3 litres, in order to comply with Group A and N regulations in the under 1,300 cm3 class. The idea is to offer amateur drivers a vehicle capable of competing in these two categories of motor racing at a lower cost.\n\nThe choice of engine was to be the new 4-cylinder Type TU24A with 95 bhp which equipped the AX Sport launched in 1987. With a displacement of 1,294 cm3, this 4-valve per cylinder unit was improved by the tuner Danielson who fitted it with two large Weber twin-barrel carburettors, a more direct intake manifold and a larger airbox. The effect is immediate: power rises to 103 bhp at 6,800 rpm for a maximum torque of 12.2 m.kg at 5,000 rpm. The performance of this new version, called TU24A/K, is 80 hp/litre. The 5-speed transmission, type MA 5 SR, has much shorter ratios. It is coupled to a dry single-plate clutch (diaphragm) of the Valéo Verto type with a diameter of 18.15 cm. The drivetrain is installed as usual, transversely at the front and inclined 30° towards the rear. The bodywork of the 205 Rallye is identical to that of the other 3-door versions, it is only available in Meije White. The braking and suspension components are taken from the 115 hp GTI, except for the dampers which are specific to the GTI.\n\nThe car has been seriously lightened (about 30 kg) by stripping it of all superfluous equipment in the cabin and on the body and the power-to-weight ratio is now 7.7 kg/hp, which gives it good handling. The result is that it manages to complete the 1,000 metres from a standing start in 30.8 seconds, while the 0 to 100 km/h is set in 8.8 seconds, with a top speed of 190 km/h! The purchaser of the 205 Rallye can thus be satisfied with performances really close to those of the 1.6 GTI version of 115 hp and this, with a notable difference in price: respectively 69 800 francs and 85 800 francs for the 1988 vintage. For comparison, the 130 hp 1.9 GTI version was sold for 94,400 francs that year. Thanks to its exceptional price/performance ratio, the Peugeot 205 Rallye was awarded the title of \"Sports car of the year\" in 1988 by the magazine \"Echappements\". The 205 Rallye was marketed for export, where modifications were sometimes made. In England, it was offered in yellow with a 75 bhp TU3 engine, while in Germany and Switzerland, it was equipped with a 105 bhp XU9J catalyzed engine.\n\nThis example with a mileage of 104000 miles. Comes to us from a private collection.  It is in superb condition & is an absolute pleasure to drive, particularly when pushing it a little harder then normal."}

During these seven years of production, four models were released that gradually became more modern, powerful and luxurious, or were only intended for use on the track. The Germans therefore have an eye for detail and luxury, which is directly reflected in the interior. They also know very well how to build cars, although new models often become controversial.\n\nThe first model was the BMW 2800 CS, a two-door coupe with a powerful 2.8L six-cylinder engine that delivers 170 hp. The design was based on the predecessor (and less popular) BMW 2000 CS. The sharp nose and horizontal lines create a sporty - later characteristic - BMW look. Just two years later, the BMW 3.0 CS was introduced, equipped with a new M30 engine, a 3.0L six-cylinder engine with 180 hp. In 1971, the 3.0 CS was the fastest road legal BMW, quickly catching the eye and being praised for its performance. The following year, the 3.0 CSL was released, the \"L\" referring to the word \"Leicht,\" which means “light” in German, the L was embodied in the light aluminium body and aerodynamic adjustments. This model won every edition of the European Touring Car Championship from 1974 to 1979. Shortly after the introduction of the CSL, Bayerische Motoren Werke also released an equivalent, meant to be sold to customers. This E9 variant was named CSi and was built for four years. This model had more luxury in general: a range of options such as automatic transmission and electric windows. Mechanically, the car is equipped with a 2986 cc in-line six-cylinder engine that delivers 200 hp.\n\nThe sporty design by Wilhelm Hofmeister, the high-performance engine that provides a never-boring driving experience, and the typical BMW look - originating from the home region - on which the BMW 6-series is based today, make this classic car highly sought after by enthusiasts.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 466 (183 inch)\nWidth (cm): 169 (66 inch)\nHeight (cm): 136 (54 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 262 (103 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1374 (3029 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: In-line six-cylinder front-engine 2986 cc\nValve gear: 12\nFuel system: Bosch D-Jetronic\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 200 hp (150 kW) at 6000 t/m\ntorque: 271 Nm at 4300 t/m\nTop speed: 224 km/h (139 mph)"}

{"name": "1973 VOLKSWAGEN KEVER CABRIOLET - €26,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The Volkswagen Beetle, officially called the Volkswagen Type 1 (or informally the Volkswagen Bug), is an economy car produced by the German auto maker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003. With over 21 million manufactured in an air-cooled, rear-engined, rear-wheel drive configuration, the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single design platform, worldwide.\n\nAlthough designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on, when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the \"Volkswagen\". Later models were designated VW 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement and the latter two being derived from the type number and not indicative of engine capacity. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for \"beetle\") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen Beetle in other countries.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Beetle was more comfortable and powerful than most European small cars,[citation needed] having been designed for sustained high speed on the Autobahn. It remained a top seller in the U.S., owing much of its success to high build-quality and innovative advertising,[citation needed] ultimately giving rise to variants, including the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia and the Volkswagen Type 2 bus.  The Beetle had marked a significant trend led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout had increased from 2.6 percent of continental Western Europe's car production in 1946 to 26.6 percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen's own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle. In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a \"retro\"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the \"New Beetle\", built on the Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In a 1999 international poll for the world's most influential car of the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBodywork\nLength: cm (in): 406 (160)\nWidth: cm (in): 155 (62.3)\nHeight: cm (in): 150 (59.4)\nWheelbase: cm (in): 242 (95.3)\nWeight: kg (lb): 870 (1918)\nMechanics.\nDisplacement: in line 4 1584 cc (97 cu in), air-cooled,  rear-mounted\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: 1 Solex carburetor\nGearbox: 4-speed manual\nDriven wheels: rear-wheel drive\nMaximum power: 53 hp at 4000 rpm\nMaximum torque: 106 Nm at 2800 rpm\nMaximum speed: 130 km/h (81 mph) \n "}

Since 1950, it has been produced in six successive series, each bringing some modernization. In addition to its functionality, its design is pragmatic and contemporary, while older models evoke a nostalgic feeling.\n\nFor a long period’s time, the Volkswagen range only had only had one model since its establishment: the Type 1 ‘Beetle’. In 1947, Dutch VW importer Ben Pon felt that the range should be expanded with a delivery van, he drew a sketch that was used three years later in the design of the Type 2, that was launched in 1950. It is a delivery van with the engine and design based on the Beetle. The engine is placed in the back, the round shapes are retained making its design look friendly.\n\nThe Type 2 quickly developed its iconic status and beloved by everyone. The hippies were so enamoured that they went to live in the bus as if it were their home. They painted their campers as a protest against global famine, poverty, and war. The buses painted by hippies have become, along with the peace sign, the symbol of the hippie subculture and carefree 1960s.\n\nOver the years, many variants were sold. Initially, it was intended as a delivery van, but camping was soon made possible, and, in the US, people were particularly fond of the pickup variant.\n\nVolkswagen T1\n\nThe T1, an embodiment of nostalgia and the carefree 60s. This multifunctional ‘Splitscreen’ bus - as it is nicknamed based on the separate front twin-windshields - is the first car where the driver sits just above the front axle. The four-cylinder rear-engine produces just enough - modest - horsepower and a unique humming sound.\n\nGiven the indestructible Volkswagen engine, an T1 is still very suitable for road tripping. They are also often used for commercial purposes, some even being converted into mobile coffee bars.\n\nIt is undeniably true that the T1 is a highly coveted classic car, and the market demand is sky-high. Who wouldn't want to be seen in such a cool bus? Undoubtedly, a T1 is a versatile investment.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 428 (169 inch)\nWidth (cm): 172 (68 inch)\nHeight (cm): 192 (76 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 240 (94 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1047 (2308 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 1493 cc four-cylinder rear-boxer engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: 1 Solex carburettor\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 53 hp (39 kW) at 4200 t/m\ntorque: 105 Nm at 2400 t/m\nTop speed: 105 km/h (65 mph)"}

{"name": "1986 PORSCHE 944 TURBO - €22,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "In mint condition, fully original\nReady to rumble\nTarga-similar removable sunroof\nInitially sold in Denmark, third owner\nMaintenance thoroughly done in 2023, though every little detail comes original and this 944 Turbo offers a lot of fun extras: electric sunroof, heated driver’s seat, electrically adjustable driver’s seat, 17’’ Cup rims, leather-finished steering wheel, ABS\nCatalysed version\nLeather and velor interior\n \n\nThe Porsche 944 was the successor to the Porsche 924. After a tumultuous 1970s, Porsche abandoned its initial plan to find a replacement for the 911 with the 924, and instead built the 944. The car's engine architecture was the focal point, creating a balance with the 911 and diversifying Porsche's offerings. It's an interesting car in Porsche's history that also caused some controversy.\n\nIntroduced in 1982, it was a coupe, which was not unusual for Porsche. Very different was the engine placement, which Porsche mounted in the front. Until then, all Porsches had rear-mounted engines, it had even become Porsche’s trademark, unofficially. Breaking away from it outraged many. Many Porsche enthusiasts were not pleased, nevertheless the sales of the 944 went well, prompting Porsche make the 944 more sporty and commercial over the years.\n\nThe 911 had a six-cylinder engine, and an eight-cylinder was too much for a Porsche entry-level model like the 944. Porsche extracted a four-cylinder from the 928’s V8 engine. The four-cylinder produced 163 horsepower and managed to accelerate from zero to 100 (0 to 60 mph) in just eight seconds. After three years, a turbocharged - thus more performant - version of the 944, the ‘944 Turbo’, was released. Two years later, an S variant with even better performance came out. In 1988, a ‘Turbo S’ combination of both was released, and in 1989, Porsche launched a convertible version.\n\nIn 1992, Porsche put an end to the 944 story. Initially, they planned to release another variant of the 944, but the new design was too discontinuous, and as a result, the 968 was born.\n\nDespite some ideological differences, the 944 was a success. An estimated total of 163,000 cars were sold. Today, the Porsche 944 is an affordable and sporty classic car that certainly bears the reputation of a real Porsche.\n\nPorsche 944 Turbo\n\nIn the spring of 1985, Porsche introduced the 944 Turbo. The design is almost identical, except for aesthetic improvements to the bumper and lights. This Porsche is turbocharged, making it considerably more performant than its predecessor. The same four-cylinder engine now produces 217 horsepower and goes from zero to 100 (0 to 60 mph) in just under six seconds.\n\nA step to the future was taken when revealing the 944 Turbo, numerous technological innovations were incorporated into the car. ABS, heated side mirrors, and an alarm system were available as an option.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the car has faded, and Porsche enthusiasts have come to appreciate and even idolize the 944. The Porsche Turbo is by far the most popular 944 and prices have been raising the last years.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 423 (167 inch)\nWidth (cm): 174 (69 inch)\nHeight (cm): 128 (50 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 240 (94 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1280 (2822 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 2479 cc turbocharged straight-four intercooled front-engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: Bosch Motronic\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 220 hp (162 kW) at 5800 t/m\ntorque: 330 Nm at 3500 t/m\nTop speed: 245 km/h (152 mph)\n "}

Until 1967, it was called Typ 1, 1200, 1300 (after the engine capacity in cc), but popularly, because of its shape, it was called Beetle, after which the manufacturer started using that name itself. More than 20 million cars of the Volkswagen Beetle were produced from 1937 to 2003. This makes it the longest and most produced car on the same platform.\n\nThe biggest change was made in the 1970s. Between August 1970 and January 1980, in addition to the \"regular\" Beetle, the 1302 and 1303 models were built, which Volkswagen itself (especially in America) called \"Super Beetle\". The 1302 was built for only two years (from August 1970 to July 1972).\n\nA few notable changes made by Volkswagen in these models were the front suspension with MacPherson struts, a shorter turning circle (although the wheelbase was 2 cm longer) and a nearly doubled usable luggage space (260 litres instead of 140 litres) under the front hatch. The latter was due to the better positioning of the spare wheel, which is laid flat in a \"Super Beetle\".\n\nThe car on offer is equipped with numerous options (both factory and \"after market\").\n\nNice to know is that the current owner can attest that the car was once supposedly owned by Michael Schumacher\"!"}

Significant technical advances, including a new light-alloy subframe with a coil and wishbone suspension, an all new engine and newly standard 6 speed transmission, made significant progress in creating a more civilized car and a greatly improved driving experience. Designed by Tony Hatter, the 993 retained the classic 911 shape but featured updated exterior panels, significantly flared wheel arches, and a smoother front and rear bumper design. The aggressive stance of the wide-style body accommodated the new multi-link rear suspension which gave the car better stability. Newly improved handling made the car more planted and helped to reduce oversteer in cornering as well as improving ride quality and reducing interior noise. The acclaimed rear design sacrificed top speeds for better handling making it the perfect weekend partner to tackle the narrow, winding English country roads. Simply put, the new design and technical improvements meant the 993 generation Porsche hit the sweet spot between usability and fun. \n\nThe 993 Targa was released in the 1996 model year and debuted a retractable glass roof dubbed the “greenhouse” system which would continue to feature on the 996 and 997 models. The glass roof slides underneath the rear window creating an open air motoring experience without the hassle of a convertible. Previous models had featured a removable roof and an enlarged b pillar that served to function as a roll bar. The new design allowed the Targa to retain the same profile design as the other Carrera variants and freed the driver from the inconvenience of storing the detached roof. This generation Targa is therefore an optimised version, offering the best of the air-cooled benefits alongside the modern, less cumbersome Targa top."}
{"name": "1971 JAGUAR E TYPE SERIES 3 V12 ROADSTER - £149,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "We have something very special on our hands, a car of significant provenance and history that ensures it is a true collectors piece. There are so many exciting key points that makes this so vastly superior to most other E-Type V12’s on the market and we are truly delighted to have brought this special car from West Sussex to North Yorkshire to find its next owner. This very early Series III V12 Roadster, chassis number 59 of the open two seater UK RHD model is somewhat unrepeatable in that it was registered new with the Coombs of Guildford owned number plate BUY 1, one of the world’s most famous registration numbers. John Coombs used BUY 1 on many of his race Jaguars during the 1960’s and when Jaguar supplied this E-Type to Coombs of Guildford, it was to be their very own demonstrator car and John Coombs assigned BUY 1, his personal plate for publicity purposes. If a genuine Coombs demonstrator new, with the registration mark BUY 1 was not special enough, this matching numbers car has only covered 38500 miles from new and whilst it has had cosmetic refurbishment, it is an incredibly original car having never required full dismantling or restoration.\nThis first class Jaguar E-Type Series III V12 Roadster was manufactured on the 12th September 1971 finished as today in Pale Primrose with Black interior, Black soft top and manual transmission. Dispatched to Coombs Garage on the 4th October and registered BUY 1 which was removed once its demonstrator services were completed, Coombs of Guildford then supplied the E-Type to its second owners, Bowyer and Partners. Having covered low mileage during the 1970's, the E-Type was in storage for most of the 1980's, and again in the late 1990's until 2018 when purchased by its last owner in West Sussex with just 38200 miles covered. A program of re-commissioning work was carried and this included a new clutch, due to lack of use the gearbox was stripped down and rebuilt with new bearings, the differential pinion oil seal replaced, the radiator was re-conditioned with an upgrade core, the brake servo re-conditioned, master cylinder replaced and flexible hoses replaced. Bottom ball joints were replaced, top ball joints re-shimmed and the car fully serviced. Although since purchase in 2018 the car has covered just a few hundred miles in fine weather only, it has been regularly serviced and also treated to a new stainless steel exhaust system, various heater hoses and new ignition system.\n\nAt 38319 miles in 2019 and cosmetically original condition, the last owner took the V12 off the road to carry out a cosmetic and detailing refurbishment program due to the aged, faded but original paintwork. The vehicle was then stripped of all its interior back to the bare floors that showed zero corrosion, and the exterior removed of all chrome, trims, seals, original vinyl hood and all glass. The bonnet, doors and boot lid were then removed, and the underside of the bonnet stripped back removing all factory stoneguard protection to the wheel arches. The stoneguard protection to the underside of the boot floor was removed, and with only very light surface corrosion found on the bodyshell that was dealt with, the bodyshell and panels were then prepared for a top class re-paint in the original Pale Primrose. The bonnet, doors and boot were then re-fitted with new hinges, rubber trims, seals, nuts, bolts and washers and the car built up with freshly re-chromed bumpers, grille and handles etc. Newly re-painted and stoneguarded splash panels with new body fittings were re-fitted and period number plates fitted, along with the excellent and original vinyl hood. Extensive engine bay detailing included newly re-painted/refurbished ancillary fittings such as heater box, air filter housings, and new nuts, bolts, washers, jubilee clips were replaced together with new hoses and wiring where necessary. The program of work was completed by 2021, placing the car into a show standard condition. Photos are also on file confirming the exceptional original condition during the strip down stage.\n\nDue to the age of the leather, whilst the interior was removed the seats were stripped down and treated to new foams and re-covered in the correct Black leather trim. The interior was then re-fitted to the car and today the E-Type still retains the correct original type 1970's carpets and vinyl hood. New chrome wire wheels and new tyres were fitted to the car and having only covered a few miles since completion, the car is an absolute show stopper in outstanding condition throughout. The bodywork, paintwork, chrome and trim are exceptional, the engine bay, like the rest of the car is worthy of show winning, and on the road the V12 is fabulous with a fit, strong, healthy low mileage V12 engine that offers blistering performance with excellent, correct oil pressure. With a rebuilt gearbox, recently replaced ball joints and complete brake overhaul, the E-Type is fantastic on the road offering a wonderful driving experience. This is a car for the discerning buyer, it's an incredibly special Jaguar E-Type that offers somewhat of an unrepeatable opportunity."}

The idea for the 914’s successor was first proposed in 1972, though it took four more years for the actual development to take shape, coinciding with the escalation of the oil crisis. The 924 was the first Porsche that had a front-mounted engine, which was somewhat contradictory to Porsche’s trademark. However, this did not hinder the 924’s period of successful sales and production. Consequently, the 924 has now evolved into a highly coveted classic car.\n\nInitially, Porsche intended to produce the 911 only temporarily. However, the sales of the 911 exploded, leading to further production. This presented Porsche with a ‘luxury problem’ as they feared an abrupt drop in sales if they relied solely on only one car. Therefore, an entry-level model was deemed necessary, and it was previously sold as the '912', then as the '914', and in 1976 the 924 came to market. The design team at Porsche was asked to create an entry-level Porsche that could accommodate four people comfortably while still embodying the sporty Porsche charisma. In 1976, they succeeded with the introduction of the 924. It was a sporty Porsche coupe that fulfilled its promise of seating four individuals, but it was atypical for Porsche because it housed a four-cylinder engine from the Audi 100 in the front. This led to some initial criticism of people stating that it was not a ‘real Porsche’. Nevertheless, times have changed, and the 924 models have garnered true admiration over the years. This is shown in the appreciating value of these models, which, like the iconic 911, make for a sound investment.\n\nAnother unique feature of the Porsche 924 was its pop-up headlights, which significantly improved the car's aerodynamics, and its nearly balanced weight distribution, achieved through the combination of a front-mounted engine with a rear-mounted transmission. Both these aspects contributed to its popularity, and by 1988, approximately 120,000 924’s had been sold, following several different variants and minor facelifts.\n\nPorsche 924 S\n\nIn 1984, Audi ceased production of the 2-litre engine that Porsche had ‘borrowed’ for the 924. Porsche responded by equipping the 924 with a 2.5-litres engine from the parallelly produced and intended successor, the 944. The modified 2.5 model was then sold as the '924 S' and remained in production from 1985 to 1988.\n\nBoth the Porsche 924 and the 924 S are fun and affordable classic cars for enthusiasts. The maintenance costs are lower compared to those of a 911, making it easy to find a well-maintained 924. Nonetheless, the 924 models have received immense appreciation, which is also reflected in their value.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 421 (166 inch)\nWidth (cm): 168 (66 inch)\nHeight (cm): 128 (50 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 240 (94 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1217 (2683 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: straight-four 2479 cc front-engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: Bosch L-Jet\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 150 hp (110 kW) at 5800 t/m\ntorque: 195 Nm at 3000 t/m\nTop speed: 215 km/h (134 mph)"}

With many innovative technologies from the 959 model, this would be a very important car for Porsche, since the world economy was undergoing recession and the company could not rely on its image alone. It was launched as the Carrera 4, the \"4\" indicating four-wheel-drive, a decision that surprised many but demonstrated the company's commitment to engineering by reminding buyers that race and rally engineering (of the 959) does affect road cars. Drag coefficient was down to 0.32. A rear spoiler deployed at high speed, preserving the purity of line when the vehicle was at rest. The chassis was redesigned overall. Coil springs, ABS brakes and power steering made their debut. The engine was increased in size to 3600 cc and developed 250 PS (184 kW). The car was more refined, but thought by some journalists to have lost some purity of the 911's concept. The rear-wheel-drive version, the Carrera 2, arrived a year later. The 964 incarnation of the 911 Turbo returned in 1990 after an absence from the price lists. At first it used a refined version of the 3.3 L engine of the previous Turbo, but two years later a turbo engine based on the 3.6 L engine of the other 964 models was introduced. In 1990, Porsche introduced the ahead-of-its-time Tiptronic automatic transmission in the 964 Carrera 2, featuring adaptive electronic management and full manual control.\n\nThe 964 was one of the first cars in the world offered with dual airbags standard (from 1991), the first being the Porsche 944 Turbo (from 1987). In 1992, Porsche re-introduced a limited-edition RS model, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS and emissions-legal in Europe only. In 1993, appeals from American customers resulted in Porsche developing the RS America of which 701 were built. In 1994, the RS America returned with rear seats. Only 84 RSA's were made in 1994. However, while European RS was a homologation special, RS America was an option delete variant of the regular model. The RS 3.8 of 1993 had Turbo-style bodywork, a larger fixed whale tail in place of the movable rear spoiler, and a 300 PS (221 kW) 3746 cc engine. Since the RS/RS America was intended as a no-frills, higher performance version of the 964, there were only four factory options available: a limited-slip differential, AM/FM cassette stereo, air conditioning, and a sunroof. The interior was more basic than a standard 911 as well; for example the interior door panels lacked the armrests and door pockets and had a simple pull strap for the opening mechanism.\n\nAlthough the RS America was about $10,000 cheaper than a fully equipped C2 at the time of their production, these models now command a premium price on the used market over a standard 964 (RS Europe was about $20,000 more expensive than a C2).\n\nSpecifications\n\nBodywork\nLength : cm (in): 429 (168.9)\nWidth : cm (in): 177 (69.9)\nHeight : cm (in): 131 (52)\nWheelbase : cm (in) : 227 (89.4)\nWeight: kg (lb) : 1370\nMechanics \nDisplacement : flat six 3600 cc, rear-mounted\nValve gear : 12\nFuel system : Bo L-Jet fuel inj\nGearbox : 5-speed, manual\nDriven wheels : rear-wheel drive\nMaximum power : 253 bhp at 5500 rpm\nTop speed : 245 km/h (152 mph)"}

Indeed, with this new model, the small manufacturer of Stuttgart can finally hope to become the equal of Ferrari by proposing a sports car able to compete with the 246 Dino and other sports of less diffusion. The \"S\" is the first high-performance version of the 911 and its great sports capabilities, developed in competition, will eventually generate more and more powerful versions.

The monsters of power that appeared in the 60s and 70s are relegated to the background, and small economical displacements arrive on the market. But it is essential to satisfy lovers of thrills and performance worthy of the name. It is under these conditions that the legendary Golf gti was born in 1976, which the engineers of France could not leave alone to invade the market. The line, quite close to the basic model, is however remarkable for a few details that do not escape admiring onlookers: low-rise tires, body-color front spoiler (ex factory), but basically, it plays it discreet but effective, like the Golf. On the road, it's a different pair of sleeves: its front end, lively and precise, greatly contributed to the image of this little bomb (for the time), and feared no one on winding roads.

{"name": "1971 MORRIS MINOR 1000 WOODY - €11,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 25994 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Often called the ‘British Beetle’\nSpacious though cute old-timer\nBelgian MOT, British maintenance bills\n \n\n \n\nThe Morris Minor was built in a first series from 1928 to 1934 and had a significantly longer heyday from 1948 to 1971. Throughout the second period of 28 years of production, the car was built by three different car manufacturers, which also adds British automotive history to the Minor. The Morris Minor is often compared to the Mini, the Fiat 500, the Citroen 2CV, and the Renault R4. Also, it is sometimes referred to as the 'British Beetle’.\n\nSir Alec Issigonis is the man behind the Morris Minor, which was introduced in 1948. The same man that designed the famous Mini a decade later. The Mini was initially even advertised as the 'Mini Minor' and was considered the successor to the Morris Minor. Despite the introduction of the Mini in 1959, the Minor remained in production for about twelve more years. Alec Issigonis’ plan for the Minor was to design a budget-friendly car that would match the quality of a higher-end car. Additionally, he was keen on turning customers into true Minor ambassadors; he wanted Minor owners to be proud of the car they were driving and managed to transform his budget-friendly cars into status symbols.\n\nThe design is adorable and almost endearing. Under the hood, there is an extension of that design. The Minor was equipped with a side-valve four-cylinder engine, but in the early 1950s, this rather outdated engine was replaced by a more modern straight-four engine.\n\nOver 1.6 million Minors were built. Various variants came on the market - you truly have Minors in all shapes and colours - and the Minor underwent extensive updates and modifications over the years to meet market demands. The initial design remained recognizable, making it iconic.\n\nMorris Traveller ('Woody')\n\nAs mentioned before, several variants were designed and conceived for the Minor, and the Traveller is one of them. The Traveller was introduced in 1953 and is an avant-garde estate car. The long and spacious rear end is finished with ash wood, therefore the Traveller was nicknamed 'Woody.'\n\nApproximately 200,000 Woody Minors were built. It is a fun and spacious classic car that can be used as a ‘workhorse’ as well as for leisure rides. Also, finding replacement parts is not a problem as Woodies were produced in large quantities for up to thirty years after the end of the Traveller’s production run.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 376 (148 inch)\nWidth (cm): 155 (61 inch)\nHeight (cm): 152 (60 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 218 (86 inch)\nWeight (kg): 762 (1680 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 1098 cc straight-six front-engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: 1 SU carburettor\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nRight-steered\npower: 49 hp (36 kW) at 5100 t/m\ntorque: 81 Nm at 2500 t/m\nTop speed: 117 km/h (73 mph)"}
{"name": "1975 MORRIS MINOR TRAVELLER WOODY - €12,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 48957 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Manufactured in 1971\n\nOne of the most accessible wood build models\nPart of a long heritage of “woody” cars\nMini powered (1000cc) engine\nVery rare in LHD (Converted)\nRecent rebuild\nDrives and performs well\nUk papers + FR papers\nNot perfect but not expensive\nThe original Minor MM series lasted from 1948–1953. It included a pair of 4-seat saloons, 2-door and 4-door, and a convertible 4-seat Tourer. The front torsion bar suspension was shared with the larger Morris Oxford, as was the almost-unibody construction. Although the Minor was originally designed to accept a flat-4 engine, with four distinctive gaps in the engine bay to accommodate it, late in the development stage it was replaced by a 918 cc (56.0 cu in) side-valve straight-4 producing 27.5 hp (21 kW) and 39 lbf ft (53 N m) of torque. This little engine pushed the Minor to just 64 mph (103 km/h) but delivered 40 miles per imperial gallon (7.1 L/100 km; 33 mpg-US).\n\nEarly cars had a painted section in the centre of the bumpers to cover the widening of the production car from the prototypes. This widening of 4 inches (102 mm) is also visible in the creases in the bonnet. Exports to the United States began in 1949 with the headlamps removed from within the grille to be mounted higher on the wings to meet safety regulations. These became standard on all Minors for 1951. When production of the first series ended, just over a quarter of a million had been sold with a surprising 30 percent being the convertible Tourer model.\n\nThe car was again updated in 1956 when the engine was increased in capacity to 948 cc (57.9 cu in). The two-piece split windscreen was replaced with a curved one-piece one and the rear window enlarged. In 1961 the semaphore-style trafficators were replaced by the more modern flashing direction indicators then becoming the norm for the UK market. An upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan but with larger BMC B-Series engine was sold as the Riley One-Point-Five/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: a version, with tail fins added, of this Wolseley / Riley variant was also produced in Australia as the Morris Major.\n\nToday the Morris Minor and 1000 are among the best served classic family-sized cars in the old vehicle movement and continue to gain popularity. The enduring affection for the \"Moggie\" (also a common British nickname for an undistinguished cat, or a Morgan) or \"Morrie\" (as it is often known in Australia and New Zealand) is reflected in the number of restored and improved Morris Minors currently running in Britain, Australasia and in India. In addition to more powerful engines, desirable improvements necessitated by the increase in traffic density since the Minor was withdrawn from volume production include the replacement of the original equipment drum brakes with discs. Other important upgrades include the 1,275 cc (77.8 cu in) version of the A-series engine, derided by Morris Marina enthusiasts as a key reason why many Marinas were scrapped. Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson once stated that the Morris Minor is Britain's Volkswagen Beetle.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecifications\n\nBodywork\n\nLength : cm (in): 378 (149)\n\nWidth : cm (in): 155 (61)\n\nHeight : cm (in): 153 (60.5)\n\nWheelbase : cm (in) : 218 (86)\n\nWeight: kg (lb) : 797 (1757)\n\nMechanics.\n\nDisplacement : straight-four 1098 cc (67 ci), front-mounted\n\nValve gear : 4\n\nFuel system : 1 SU carburettor\n\nGearbox : 4 speed manual\n\nDriven wheels : rear-wheel drive\n\nLeft hand drive\n\nMaximum power : 48 bhp at 5100 rpm\n\nMaximum torque : 81 Nm at 2500 rpm\n\nTop speed : 124 km/h (77 mph)"}

Instantly recognizable to this day, they have achieved something of a cult status, given their widespread use during the ’60s and later, often associated with the surf culture from that decade. \n\nThe earliest models are referred to as ‘split screen’, referencing the windscreen style and the revised version – introduced in 1967 – the ‘bay-window’, similarly referencing a now altered windscreen design. In addition to this change, the second-generation vehicle was a little larger and heavier than the first variant; had revised suspension; 12-volt electrics and larger, more powerful engine options. In 1972, the flat-four engine was available in an enlarged 1.7 litre size, with a claimed 66 bhp available, driving through a 4-speed, manual transmission. Various cosmetic changes were also introduced in the early 1970’s, such as squared-off bumpers to meet US crash safety standards.\n\nIn the early ‘50s, Volkswagen commissioned a camper van conversion of the Type 2 and subcontracted the build of the vehicle to the company Westfalia-Werke. These ‘Westfalia’ conversions were made available worldwide through the VW dealer network and production continued until 2003 (based on the later T3 model).  \n\nThis 1973 model van was first registered in California in July 1973 and remained in the hands of a single US owner until 2007. As a well-maintained and largely rot-free import, it was re-registered in the UK in July 2008 and, in the hands of its new owners, underwent a substantial professional renovation at marque experts Autostyl, Truro, Cornwall. In 2011, the fully restored vehicle was featured in the September edition of VolksWorld Camper & Bus magazine. In May 2013 the Westfalia was purchased by a Jersey-based owner and has only been lightly used since. \n\nThe vehicle has been well-maintained throughout its life in the US – there are substantial service history records on file. The engine received considerable work in 2004 and has not clocked up a high mileage since that time. The engine bay was refinished as part of the renovation work completed following import to the UK. Mechanically, it’s in very good condition and all running as it should.\n\nIn respect of the bodywork, the extensive renovation work carried out in 2008 - 2009 comprised fully stripping the van, the completion of dent & corrosion repairs retaining the original panels and a full respray of the vehicle in its original orange colour scheme. At that time, new replica Fuchs alloy wheels were fitted. The Westfalia remains in excellent condition, having been used sparingly and only in the dry since its move to Jersey.\n\nThe interior of the van was completely stripped as part of the post-import renovation and any repair/replacement work completed as required. The seating was wholly re-trimmed in white leather and the cabin is in first-class condition. \n\nThis is a particularly smart, well-kept VW Westfalia in an excellent and very usable condition. There are extensive records of the vehicles early life and the renovation works carried out on import to the UK. \n\nThe van is currently Jersey registered and the registration number is not included in sale. We can ship worldwide and can assist/advise with shipping and importing processes if required."}

The car’s performance values are a testament to its inner strength: a 3.9 litre engine with direct fuel injection. The power output is 385 hp at 6,500 rpm. The maximum torque is 420 Nm at 4,400 rpm.\n\nWith PDK, and the Sports Chrono Package Plus, the 0-62 mph is achieved in just 4.3 seconds and the top speed is 188 mph.  Additionally, the sound produced by the two stainless steel twin tailpipes is characteristically Porsche. Perfect roadholding is assured by Porsche Active Suspension Management, and the 10-mm lowered suspension. However, along with all these sporting features, this remains a practical everyday sports car. \n\nSupplied new by Porsche Centre Nottingham in November 2009, this Carrera S has enjoyed Porsche main dealer servicing throughout its life.  It is supplied with its spare remote key, original driver’s book pack and Porsche service invoices in the history file.  Fresh from a 10-year ownership, this Carrera S has had a mere 2 keepers from new. This is an opportunity to own what is probably the most original, low mileage 997 Carrera S on sale today.  A 12-month comprehensive warranty will also be included.\n\nAvailable to view now at our London showrooms."}

Porsche substantially revised the suspension, replacing torsion bars with coil springs and shock absorbers. Power steering and ABS brakes were added to the 911 for the first time; both were standard.  The first 964 models were introduced in 1989, with Porsche adding the more popular rear wheel drive Carrera 2 variant to the range in 1990. The 964 enjoyed a new naturally aspirated engine called the M64, with a flat-6 displacement of 3.6 litres. Power output is 250 bhp at 6,100 rpm and top speed is 162 mph.\n\n \n\nFor open-top enthusiasts who desire more immersive experience the only car to drive is the 911 Carrera Cabriolet, one of the swiftest and most stylish soft-tops. The Cabriolet has strengthened windscreen pillars to give the car the tautness of the original 911 Carrera Coupe, whilst the electric Cabriolet hood offers a unique sense of driving freedom. The Tiptronic gearbox has Intelligent Shift Programme to prevent unwanted automatic changes, and when switched to manual mode, immediate upward or downward clutchless gear changes are achieved by tipping the gear lever forwards or backwards.\n\n \n\nOur Porsche 964 was sold new by Glen Henderson Porsche in May 1990, and has its original leather book complete with a service history file. It has been serviced by Porsche main dealers and Porsche specialists and has historic MOT certificates with the history file. It has also benefitted from a recent service, brake fluid change, gearbox service, belt replacement, and a new N-rated tyre set. This is a wonderful, low mileage 911 which is not to be missed.  The 964 Cabriolet will also be supplied with a 12-month comprehensive warranty.  Available to view now at our London showroom."}

Lightweight exclusive materials, such as Alcantara and carbon-fibre, dominate, yet it all exudes the sense of craftsmanship and sophistication typical of all Ferrari interiors, thanks to hand-stitching, aluminium tread plates, and fluidly sculpted door panels.\n\nTwo figures sum up just how extraordinary the 458 Speciale’s mid-rear 4.497 cc V8 really is: its ability to punch out 605 cv at 9000 rpm makes it the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 ever built at Maranello while its specific power output of 135 cv/l was a world record for a road-going naturally aspirated engine. Honing of the entire car also resulted in an exceptional weight-power ratio of 2.13 kg/cv and the kind of performance that makes it worthy of the Speciale moniker: 0 to 62 mph acceleration in 3 secs (and a record 1min 23.5 secs lap time at Fiorano).\n\nIn terms of electronic management, the 458 Speciale marked the world debut of Slide Slip Angle Control, (SSC) and an upgrade of the F1 transmission control logic. With the Manettino seat at RACE or CT OFF, the 458 Speciale then makes the most of available grip for improved acceleration out of the corners, greater ease and control on the limit, and more consistent performance.\n\nSupplied new by Maranello Egham Ferrari in April 2014, this one owner car covered just over 1,700 miles from new, and has a complete Ferrari main dealer service history, new car bill of sale, all handbooks, services invoices, and owner’s launch information. The 458 Speciale is presented in quite excellent condition throughout. Available to view now at our London showrooms."}

The engine is essentially a mildly uprated, more powerful version of the Turbo’s and now has 523bhp at 6500rpm and a constant 502lb ft between 2200-4500rpm. The chassis is a development of the GT3’s with a bespoke aluminium rear subframe, standard-fit carbon ceramic brakes and, being a GT2, no front drive shafts. Yes, each and every one of those 523bhp reaches the road via just two contact patches, courtesy of a pair of huge 325/30 19in Michelin Pilot Cup tyres.”\n\nThey continued, “Despite the fact that the GT2 can, according to Porsche, accelerate from zero to 62mph in 3.7sec, from zero to 100mph in 7.4sec and doesn’t run out of puff until a quite hilarious 204mph, the latest GT2 is something of a pussy to drive. Unlike its predecessor the new GT2 delivers in pretty much all departments. It’s time-bendingly quick in a straight line, and the way the engine feels so primed off-boost is surpassed only by the way it fires you with such total conviction on-boost. Bugatti Veyron apart I reckon this is the best turbocharged engine installation there has yet been. But the best thing about the new GT2 is that the rest of the package is now so sorted you can actually use the performance on the road.”\n\nOur car was supplied new by Porsche Centre Cardiff in October 2008. This 2009 MY car has had 7 Porsche and Porsche marque specialist services, the most recent of which was carried out at Porsche Centre Leicester in January 2023. It has a clean over rev test and is complete with its driver book pack, and history file, which contains service invoices and historic MoT certificates, factory build sheet, and spare remote key. The GT2 will also be supplied with a 12-month comprehensive written warranty.\n\nAvailable to view now at our London showrooms."}

MGB production continued throughout restructuring of the British motor industry, and the parent company’s transition from BMC to British Motor Holdings (in 1966) and to British Leyland Motor Corporation (in 1968).\n\nThe roadster was the first of the MGB range to be produced. The body was a pure two-seater but a small rear seat was a rare option at one point. By making better use of space the MGB was able to offer more passenger and luggage accommodation than the earlier MGA while being 3 inches (75 mm) shorter overall. The suspension was also softer, giving a smoother ride, and the larger engine gave a slightly higher top speed. The four speed gearbox was an uprated version of the one used in the MGA with an optional (electronically activated) overdrive transmission. Wheel diameter dropped from 15 to 14 inches (360 mm).\n\nIn late 1967, sufficient changes were introduced for the factory to define a Mark II model. Changes included synchromesh on all 4 gears with revised ratios, an optional Borg-Warner automatic gearbox (except in the US), a new rear axle and an alternator in place of the dynamo with a change to a negative earth system. To accommodate the new gearboxes there were significant changes to the sheet metal in the floorpan, and a new flat-topped transmission tunnel. All models are rear-wheel drive. To meet US safety regulations, later North American tourers got three windscreen wipers instead of just two (to sweep the required percentage of the glass), and also received a plastic and foam rubber covered \"safety\" dashboard, dubbed the \"Abingdon pillow\".\n\nOther markets continued with the steel dashboard. Rubery Owen ROstyle wheels were introduced to replace the previous pressed steel versions in 1969 and reclining seats were standardized in 1970. 1971 also saw a new front grille, recessed, in black aluminium. The more traditional-looking polished grille returned in 1972 with a black \"honeycomb\" insert. 1970 saw split rear bumpers with the number-plate in between, 1971 returned to the earlier five-piece style.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBodywork\nLength : cm (in): 389 (153)\nWidth : cm (in): 152 (59.8)\nHeight : cm (in): 49.2)\nWheelbase : cm (in) : 231 (90.9)\nWeight: kg (lb) : 885 (1953)\nMechanics\nDisplacement : straight-4 1798 cc (110 ci), front-mounted\nValve gear : 8\nFuel system : 2 SU HS4 carbs\nGearbox : 4 speed manual + overdrive\nDriven wheels : rear-wheel drive\nLHD\nMaximum power : 94 bhp at 5500 rpm\nMaximum torque : 149 Nm at 3000 rpm\nTop speed : 173 km/h (108 mph) "}

In 1959, British car manufacturer British Motor Corporation (BMC) released the Austin Mini, it is obvious that they had a clear goal in mind: releasing a small city-fit car with a cute design. Thanks to The Beatles and its starring in countless famous films, the car has acquired an iconic status over the decades.\n\nIt was Alec Issigonis, a British-Greek car designer that worked for BMC, who gave birth to the Mini. He had a clear goal in mind: to create an affordable and fuel-efficient car that is efficient and light-steering in narrow British city streets. This approach, along with the playful design, created a true hype among young people. The Mini also became extremely popular with influential people, to the point that all members of The Beatles - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr - proudly show off their Minis. In 1969, the car takes on the leading role in the film The Italian Job, in which bank robbers used a Mini as a getaway car. Also Mr. Bean’s car is a lime green 1977 Mini, which emphasizes his clumsiness in the best way possible.\n\nInitially, the Mini was manufactured in various finishes, such as a sedan, a station wagon, a van, and even a pickup truck. Those finishes never really became fancied among the crowd. Also, in the 1980s, the Mini began losing its fame due to fierce competition from other car brands. This caused a harsh financial crisis in 1986 at British Leyland - the former BMC that also own Jaguar, Rover, Triumph, and MG. They even decide to restructure and privatize the company and from that moment on Rover Group was born. In 1994, Rover Group sells Mini to BMW, which seven years later, in 2001, launch a refined version of the Mini. Nowadays BMW still produce the Mini – baring its British identity in mind – and it is available in various finishes: a convertible, a fully electric version, a hybrid version, a sports version, and even a station wagon.\n\nAs mentioned before, the goal was to build a city car that fit in traffic in cities, therefore they had to use as little space as possible, that was a real challenge in the middle of the 20th century. The 1950s are often considered a tipping point in automotive technology, and the Mini has contributed to that tipping point: a front-wheel drive car with a transverse and space-saving engine that is highly responsive and fit to city traffic.\n\nToday, the Mini is a coveted classic car, and not only among classic car enthusiasts. The cute and vulnerable design simply steals everyone's hearts.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 305 (120 inch)\nWidth (cm): 141 (56 inch)\nHeight (cm): 135 (53 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 204 (80 inch)\nWeight (kg): 640 (1411 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: Transverse in-line-four 848 cc engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: 1 S.U. carburettor\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: FWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 34 hp (25 kW) at 5500 t/m\ntorque: 60 Nm at 5500 t/m\nTop speed: 116 km/h (72 mph)"}

So welcome to Vincent my pride and joy who has been the most reliable daily driver and by far the most favorite car I have ever owned as well as being my second Z3. Bodywork: As can be seen from the pictures (taken Tuesday 11th July 2023), for a 22-year-old car it does look very presentable and still very modern I am constantly complimented on clean and great it still looks. There are no nasty scuffs, scrapes, or scratches. It does have some marks commensurate with age, most notably a little bit of stone chips on the bonnet but not noticeable unless you really look. The car is in great condition from a corrosion point of view, with the sills and wings (the places they corrode on Z3s) in fantastic condition. Interior: Again as can be seen from the pictures, the interior is in very good condition for it's age, with minimal wear. Mechanicals: The car starts on the button and runs and drives perfectly. The clutch is good and it pulls through each gear well. I have just recently completed a trip to Cornwall and Peak District in one week putting on over 800 miles and has been super reliable every day in my ownership. Soft Top: The Mohair soft top is in good condition with one small tear but watertight. History: Comes with all originals manuals and has a good amount of part service history.

I am selling the car on behalf of the owners widow and it is a reluctant sale but it is not a practical option for her. When I visited last week the battery was completely flat and the car would not start with a jump from a good battery. The car is therefore being sold as a non runner at a price much lower than previously envisaged. Most of you will know that the Ultima was fitted with every option available at the time, for those of you who are unfamiliar with these car can find everything on the internet. The car is in reasonably good condition having been maintained regularly until it was parked up. The car is also fitted with a GPL system which greatly reduces the running costs. The car also comes with a considerable quantity of spare parts from a second car which was scrapped. While I was charging the battery I took the only photo I have of the car as the weather was not very good. As always it is better to physically view the car as expectations can vary. The car is located at the owners address in Harrow. At £2000 I think the price is very reasonable and therefore I am not inviting offers on this price."}

It was a true status symbol that extrudes performance and prestige. Its price, its specifications, and its performance show that this a a car only the lucky few can afford. The W107 also had the difficult task of succeeding the famous Pagoda, which still shared a strong resemblance to its predecessor, the Gullwing. With the W107, Mercedes-Benz took a leap into the unknown future, without leaving behind its trademarking luxury. Except the G-class, this is the Mercedes-Benz’s car that has been in production for the longest period, the production just stopped in 1989.\n\nThe W107 came in two finishes. There was convertible R107 - or SL - with a soft-top, optional hard-top, and optional two-seat rear bench. Also, there was a C107 - or SLC - which was a two-door hard-top coupe with four seats. Both cars were available with a range of engines that all were impressive in their own right. Over the years, fewer engines were available, though each engine was made to perform. In 1981, the successor to the C107 was introduced, and production of it ended. The R107 continued to be sold in large numbers with three different engines until 1989. The total production number is estimated to be around 237,000 unique units.\n\nThe aerodynamic and less rounded design was contemporary, compared to its predecessors. Though it was not Mercedes typical at the time, the curves were replaced, in order to fit its decade. The long hood and short rear emphasize class and exude sportiness, while the Mercedes’ star in the grille adds charisma and prestige. The interior is very recognizable as Mercedes, very luxurious, with a classic finish in leather and wood tones. For the US, a number of aesthetic adjustments were made based on their regulations. The square headlights were replaced with round ones, and the bumpers protruded to absorb a collision at five kilometres per hour without damage, as required by US law.\n\nMercedes-Benz W107 450 SL\n\nThe 450 SL Mercedes W107 model was manufactured from 1973 to 1980 and it was the most powerful variant in the W107 series during its production period. Under the hood lies the most powerful eight-cylinder engine of the series at that time, paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. Due to the torque-rich nature of the engine, offering a manual transmission was simply impossible.\n\nThe 450 SL is the best-selling W107-variant, approximately 100,000 units were produced. This high production number actually makes it easier to find replacement parts, which is a great advantage that even adds to its uniqueness.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 463 (182 inch)\nWidth (cm): 179 (70 inch)\nHeight (cm): 129 (51 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 246 (97 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1665 (3671 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 4520 cc V8 front-engine\nValve gear: 16\nFuel system: Bosch-Jetronic\nGear box: 3-speed automatic\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 180 hp (134 kW) at 4750 t/m\ntorque: 298 Nm at 3000 t/m\nTop speed: 199 km/h (124 mph)"}

This new series also came with a lot of superstar glamour. It came in a wide range of various engines, and was produced for thirteen years on end, from 1989 to 2001. Like its ancestors, the Gullwing, the Pagoda, and the R107, the R129 quickly gained the cult status it deserved.\n\nIn 1989, discontinued the R107 series and decided to succeed it by a new series called the R129. However, this replacement was not the true end of the R107 as it still is a coveted classic nowadays. The R129 is an equally sporty, if not sportier compared to its predecessors, and Mercedes-Benz’ characteristics were embodied in it as well: the design is contemporary, and it came with innovative technologies. Just some of these technologies were an electrified automatic convertible system, a safety-enhancing automatically deploying rollover bar in the event of an accident, even a very innovative driving position system was installed in the seats. Besides that, the R129 was available in various engine finishes, as it had been this way before. People could change in a range of engines that went from a 12-valve six-cylinder engine to a 48-valve V12. Though all engines had their own charm and all of them were impressively performant.\n\nThe angulated design typifies Mercedes-Benz’ nineties style which was also retained after facelifts in 1995 and 1998. However, these facelifts brought some visible distinctions, the most noticeable being the cases of the turn signals, which were no longer orange but coloured with the transparent headlights. From 1998, each cylinder was powered with two spark plugs in order to achieve an even smoother and more efficient combustion with maximum efficiency.\n\nThe R129 is a tribute, and a continuation of the past of Mercedes-Benz' classy and powerful coupes. At the same time, its new technology shows preparedness for the future.\n\nMercedes 500 SL\n\nThe 500 SL was released as being the flagship of the R129 series that was first shown to the world in 1989. Its powertrain must be the most noteworthy as this car is powered by a 5.0L V8 that makes the car able to accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometres per hour (0-60 mph) in only six seconds. Pumping the gas pedal to the maximum makes it speed up to 250 kilometres per hour (155 mph) in its fourth - highest - gear.\n\nThis series’ 500 SL will be a true investment that proves to be both functional and profitable. Its predecessors have their value been skyrocketing in the past years. Time will tell how long it will last until this R129 also increases in value.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 447 (176 inch)\nWidth (cm): 181 (71 inch)\nHeight (cm): 129 (51 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 252 (99 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1770 (3902 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 4973 cc V8 front-engine\nValve gear: 32\nFuel system: Bosch KE5-Jetronic\nGear box: 4-speed automatic\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 322 hp (240 kW) at 5500 t/m\ntorque: 450 Nm at 4000 t/m\nTop speed: 250 km/h (155 mph)"}

Comprehensively rebuilt in 1997, the works completed also included the subframe being zinc galvanised and strengthened, a roll cage fitted. The bodywork was recently resprayed again in Red, effectively the closet paint match to previous colour. The mechanical upgrades and improvements comprised a new Stage 2 1700 cc Ford Crossflow engine (supplied by Anglian Engines) built with a stage 2 Piper Cam, also a Piper all-steel rocker assembly with twin 40 Webber (DCOE’s) carburetors fitted. The gearbox was replaced with a fully refurbished Ford 2000E (three rail version) mated to a 3.0 Capri back axle, with gear ratios changed to 3.77 to 1. The interior was renovated and refreshed in cloth. Other new mechanical ancillaries included a  Kenlowe fan, alternator, radiator and associated pipework changed. The Piper also got uprated power server assisted brakes. Interior has a recent Kenwood CD radio fitted with 150 watt speakers in the doors. It also has a reversing camera (detachable screen) and individual powered air vents. Coveted since by the current owner, the Piper is now offered following his forty-four year ownership. It has malitculous records kept, including manuals made and moulds and spares for sale to. This is an undoubtedly rare opportunity to acquire a very low production British sports car. "}

I have both the factory build specification and the Porsche CoA to confirm authenticity. This 930 is no low mileage garage queen - current mileage is 147000. At 10 years old she had already covered 120000 miles, primarily in the hands of a genuine enthusiast who ensured that she didn't lack for anything whilst traversing the country as his company car. The complete service history file for that period from Autofarm shows that any work deemed necessary was done, which included an engine rebuild at 71000 miles in 1982. When sold in 1987 the car went into another period of long term enthusiast ownership of 22 years - again covered in the comprehensive history file. I've actually owned this 930 twice. I first bought the car in 2009, and then allowed a serial 911 turbo collector to persuade me to part with it a year later. Fortunately I was given the opportunity to buy it back in 2012. Since then it has had a major mechanical overhaul, including another full engine rebuild - not just the top end - in 2015. The bodywork has not been restored. Any corrosion issues have been dealt with on an as and when basis. In 2017 the kidney bowls and sills on both sides were replaced.

Global history including owners living in the US, UK, Netherlands and Monaco.

If you are a fan of the model of Mustang immortalised by Steve McQueen's Lieutenant Frank Bullitt, and one of the most memorable car chases in cinematic history, then you'll probably be taken by JGU 257C, which is perhaps the best 289 Fastback seen and one of the highest specifications have seen. Manufactured on 23 November 1964 for the 1965 model year, this Mustang has had somewhat of a globetrotting history, living in Florida until it was imported to the UK in 1998. In 2009, the car was purchased by it's next owner, who lived in the Netherlands, Monaco and back to the UK, with the car in that ownership being used on a number of European road rallies at the time. In April of 2020, the car was purchased by it's current owner, with the car being stored professionally since.\nPresented in a beautiful shade of Pearlescent Green with contrasting Black interior, JGU 257C benefits from an impressive specification, including Ron Morris adjustable engine mounts, Edelbrock Performer Aluminium cylinder heads, Comp Cams Magnum aluminium roller rockers, Edelbrock Performer RPM high lift hydraulic lifter camshaft, Edelbrock Performer timing gear set, Edelbrock Performer dual plane with Endurashine finish, Edelbrock Performer 4bb."}

From that moment forward, this automotive treasure has remained under his dedicated ownership.\n\nWhat initially captivated the owner’s attention and sparked his interest in this particular car was its unparalleled and distinctive design, coupled with its pioneering engineering.

{"name": "1995 JENSEN FF MK1 - £104,950 ", "transmission": " AUTO", "mileage": " 43700 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Jensen FF is a classic car that has garnered praise from the motoring press and enthusiasts alike since its unveiling at the 1966 London Motor Show. The FF moniker stands for Ferguson Formula, which was a revolutionary four-wheel-drive system developed by Harry Ferguson for racing cars. The system split the torque between the front and rear wheels, resulting in excellent handling and sure-footedness. This, combined with the Dunlop Maxaret anti-lock braking system, made the FF a frontrunner for the title of \"World's Safest Car\" during its time.\n\nApart from its advanced technical abilities, the FF's distinct looks also set it apart from other classic GTs of its era. The longer wheelbase, squared-off front, and additional vents give the car an unmistakable presence. Underneath the chassis rails were moved outboard to make space for the Ferguson four-wheel-drive system. The FF was designed to be a forward-thinking car, which is evident from the praise it received from the media and enthusiasts when it was first released.\n\nThe 1966 Jensen Mk1 FF (chassis #119/102) presented here is an exceptional example of this iconic car. It was originally ordered in Crystal Blue paintwork with Beige leather and was supplied through the Jensen distributors, A.R.D. Garage (Cwmbran) Ltd. The car was purchased by Welsh businessman Mr R. F. Arnatt in late 1968 and remained a Welsh-owned car until 2008. During this time, the car underwent several maintenance and restoration works, including a bodywork renovation, engine rebuild, and overhaul of the brakes and suspension.\n\nIn 2008, the Jensen Museum acquired the car and undertook a full restoration. This work included stripping the car back to bare metal, matching the Crystal Blue paint color, and restoring the original leather seats. The original carpets were replaced with a full new Wilton set. Our vendor acquired the car in 2014 and has since commissioned a full recommissioning of the car, including a full gearbox rebuild, brake and suspension overhaul, and other maintenance work. The car is accompanied by numerous historic invoices for maintenance and a CD-ROM of the bodywork restoration.\n\nIn conclusion, this 1966 Jensen Mk1 FF (chassis #119/102) is a rare opportunity to own a piece of British motoring history that is in excellent condition and would make a fine addition to any classic car collection. The car has an MOT valid until August 2023 and comes with a rich history and documentation of its maintenance and restoration work.\n\nSpecification:\nMake: JENSEN\nModel: FF\nRegistration Number: TAX 664G\nChassis Number: 119/102\nEngine Number: 1417/19D\nTransmission: Auto\nBody Colour: Crystal Blue\n\nTo provide peace of mind to the new owner, this car comes with a 3,000 Mile/3 Month warranty*, offering protection against unforeseen issues.

The car still has a large following to this day and a good support network through specialist suppliers and an owners club. \n\nLimited changes were made to the car prior to the substantial revision to its appearance from the 1974 model year, when the original chrome bumpers were replaced with new, steel-reinforced black rubber bumpers front and rear, to meet new US impact regulations. \n\nThroughout the model’s life, the 1800cc engine was rated at 95 bhp peak power at 5,400 rpm, with a 6,000 rpm redline. In 1968 the gearbox was uprated to offer full synchromesh on all 4 gears. This gave performance figures of a top speed around 105 mph, and a 0-60 mph time of around 12 seconds. \n\nThis ‘chrome bumper’ model dates from 1972, having been first registered new in the UK in May of that year. We know nothing further of the car’s subsequent history until it was purchased by a Jersey resident and re-registered in the island in May 2019. \n\nMechanically sound – with some work undertaken to ensure the car passed the rigorous local re-registration inspection. The car runs and drives very well. A stainless steel exhaust system has been fitted.\n\nThe car has clearly been well-cared for during its life with evidence under the vehicle of some body repair work having been carried out. The Teal Blue paintwork is not perfect, but quite presentable, with the wire wheels and all brightwork in a good condition. The foldaway hood is fully functioning. \n\nThe black interior is in very good condition with a wood veneer dash cover fitted, uprated (and very comfortable) leather seats and an aftermarket steering wheel. \n\nAn attractive MGB Roadster with some extras fitted and in a good, solid condition, driving well and ready to go. This example would make a perfectly viable ‘daily-driver’. \n\nThe car is currently Jersey registered and we can assist with shipping and importing processes if required. We can ship worldwide."}

In 1968 the gearbox was uprated to offer full synchromesh on all 4 gears. This gave performance figures of a top speed around 105 mph, and a 0-60 mph time of around 12 seconds. \n\nThis rubber-bumper GT model was first registered new in Jersey in June 1975 and has remained in the island all its life. With a modest 5 owners over nearly 50 years, it has clocked up just over 70,000 miles in that time. The current owner acquired the car after a lengthy period in storage and has returned the vehicle to a fully roadworthy condition. \n\nThe recent re-commissioning works have included the fitment of a new radiator, water pump, thermostat and hoses, together with a refurbishment of the braking system. A welcome upgrade to the car is to be found with the installation of an EZ electric power steering unit. The car drives very well.\n\nThis MGB has not been the subject of substantial restoration work, but there is evidence of some repair work having been carried out. The underside of the car is sound with just a little light surface corrosion, as might be anticipated. The gleaming red paintwork and Rostyle wheels present well. The car has a folding sunroof and additional driving lamps fitted. \n\nThe original interior is in a good condition, benefitting from the addition of leather seat covers and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. It has a stereo cassette unit fitted.\n\nThis is a tidy, original, late model MGB GT in a generally good condition. It is ready to be enjoyed by a new owner and – with the benefit of the electrically assisted power-steering fitted - would make a very capable, classic daily-driver.\n\nThe car is currently Jersey registered and we can assist with shipping and importation processes if required. We can ship worldwide."}

I was going to restore it as a show car but I’ve too many cars so selling this with all the parts I amassed to do it - hence the price. The car cost £14525 in 1987. Drives well. Shell and engine very good. I replaced the brake callipers, discs and pads front and rear, radiator, water pump, alternator, distributor, battery tray, battery, slam panel and new OEM wheel arch trims. Small on side of bonnet but can be pushed out. (Picture 13) Paint not damaged. Rust on a couple of the door bottoms but replacement doors or panels offered with sale (doors are a different colour). Doors can be repaired- it’s only the bottom inner edge that’s has rust (a common fault). No rust anywhere else - drive tunnels and wheel arches all good. Front indicator cracked. Rear bumper dented, seats have wear but excellent replacements all included in the price. I’ve put a sample of the parts in the picture, but there’s a lot more included in the sale. It’s a complete interior. I’ve done quite a bit mechanically, it’s been well maintained to the Saab service schedule throughout its life so it’s just trim and door bottoms that need doing but it’s still perfectly useable as it is.

All seats, door cards and headrests plus rear shelf and knee pad + carpets, uncracked  indicator, complete set of replacement bumpers - professionally painted in Saab anthracite grey -  unmarked (rear one will need painting) I have many more parts if needed - ie spoiler, front fog lights, wood dash, underdress bin for extra cost.

We sold this fabulous example back in 2016 to one of our local regular customers who covered around 2000 faultless miles over six years.\nWhen supplying it back in 2016, it was the first early Bristol 411 we had the pleasure of selling in several years and many do still regard this model as of one of the most desirable of the series. We took the car back in part exchange during the summer of 2022 and the car was initially used regularly by our Company Chairman. Ideal for long distance touring, the Bristol coped well with in rush hour traffic driving from Newcastle on one occasion, and was also driven back from Goodwood Festival of Speed - a five hour drive in this car proving relaxed and very comfortable. This proven ultra reliable example then sold to one of our long term friends and clients in Worcestershire who has kept the Bristol with us in storage for his use when up visiting friends in Yorkshire.\n\nSince 2012 over £15,000 has been spent on the Bristol and as a result comes to us in exceptional condition. Back in 2016 and prior to coming into our ownership, the Bristol was booked into our Malton Coachworks workshop for a full appraisal prior to being sold. We found no mechanical concerns, and just like when we sold it in 2016, it is ready to use, enjoy and is ideal for long distance touring or regular use. Work in the years prior to first coming to us included a new radiator, heater tap, six track rod end gaiters, top wishbone bump stops, new power steering belt, new alternator belt, exhaust silencer, new petrol pump, re-conditioned brake servo, new ignition items and extensive servicing.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2016 the 411 covered 9000 miles, a further 3000 have been covered since 2016 taking the recorded and believed genuine mileage to 95,000. Since being sold in 2022, the Bristol has had cosmetic attention to include a new wool carpet set, re-chromed wheel trims, leather seats have been carefully treated and some detail paintwork carried out. The front and rear windscreen rubbers have also been replaced and the car is without doubt ready to use and enjoy, looking even sharper than the previous time we sold the car as result of its recent owners attention to detail.\n\nHME 85K is outstanding to drive delivering superb performance from its 6277cc big block series Chrysler V8 engine giving an estimated 30% more power than the earlier Bristol cars with the 5211cc V8 engine. The automatic gearbox is perfectly smooth, the power steering fabulous and brakes and steering feel firm, efficient and top class. HME 85K is a fabulous car to drive and can be used and driven with confidence. The car presents beautifully with a lovely deep paint finish, fabulous straight body panels, good quality chrome and has a very honest, original and well cared for look. The upholstery is impressive with Black leather seats, high quality new carpets and delightful dashboard, dials and headlining. The Bristol has a true feeling of quality and finding genuine, very original examples of the 411 is becoming increasingly difficult."}

This legendary super car was ordered new in 2006 by one of our long term clients and for the past 17 years the Ford has been part of an impressive car collection and used sparingly.\nThe new car order was placed on the 1st June 2006 with London based Company American Car Imports in Midnight Blue with Ebony Black upholstery. The car features options to include the lightweight aluminum BBS alloy wheels, Monotone paint application with clearcoat metallic, painted Red brake calipers, painted racing stripes and the McIntosh audio system.\n\nDuring the cars early life with its owner living in the London area, it was maintained by Euro American Car Services Ltd at 2195, 2206, 2640, 2952 and 3492 miles in 2012. In 2013 the GT was driven to the owners home in North Yorkshire and over the past 10 years it has covered just 1300 miles. The car has been maintained by a local North Yorkshire garage who have looked after many of the long term owners collection, and most years they have MOT tested the Ford and carried out any maintenance required. The GT has arrived with us in completely original, immaculate showroom condition with perfect bodywork, paintwork and trim. As expected with little over 5000 miles from new, it is mechanically exceptional and requiring no work. The history file with the car includes the original owners manual/service book, MOT certificates, service invoices, tracker details, original order information and spare keys.\n\nThe Ford GT is without doubt one of the most legendary super cars designs of all time, built as a homage to the 1964 Ford GT40. With a super charged V8 engine and six speed manual gearbox, these cars are truly outstanding to drive and without doubt a true collectors piece.

Launched at the Paris Motor Show in 1976, the range-topping 512BB was at the pinnacle of 1970’s supercar motoring.  Equipped with a 5-litre version of the 12-cylinder boxer, the new engine proved a great success, giving the same power at lower revs, better torque and a smoother delivery than the earlier version in the 365 GT4 BB. The Pininfarina coachwork differed only slightly from the previous model in certain details which not only made it look even more elegant but also helped improve engine cooling by using NACA ducts forward of the rear wheel arches.\n\nThe car’s engine shared its internal dimensions with the V12 from the Daytona but was spread out to 180° like Ferrari’s 1970 Formula One cars and was mounted above a five-speed manual transmission.  One major difference in this engine was its use of timing belts rather than chains.  The engine was enlarged to 4942 cc, with an increased compression ratio of 9.2:1. A dual-plate clutch handled the added torque and eased the pedal effort. Engine power was 360 bhp (268 kW) @6200 rpm giving the car a top speed of 179 mph, and an acceleration time of 0 -62 mph (0 - 100 km/h) in 5.4 secs.\n\nThe 512BB was supplied new by Ritches Ferrari, Glasgow in January 1980 at a cost of over £33,000.  Their Ferrari service and maintenance invoices, along with those of Ferrari specialists form a huge history file.  The 512BB retains its MOT history and historic road tax discs. Benefitting from a recent full Ferrari main dealer service, new spark plugs, brake fluid service, anti-freeze service, gear box oil change and belt change costing over £5,000, this 512BB will make a great addition to any Ferrari collection.  Complete with its original woven book pack, Ferrari archive records and Ferrari tool case, a 12-month comprehensive written warranty will also be included.\n\nThe 512BB is available to view now at our London showroom."}

{"name": "1994 MASERATI BITURBO S - €27,500 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Very rare in this close to mint condition\nItalian vehicle from 1984, only approx. 150 made in this S-series\nPurchased in 1984 by a Maserati collector, first registered in 1994 and kept in that same collection until 2012\nOnly 18 vehicles made with these Missoni seats\nVery low mileage: only 6552 km (4071 miles) driven!\n  \n\nThe Maserati Biturbo was launched in 1981, under the wing of Alessandro De Tomaso with the aim of saving Maserati from bankruptcy. De Tomaso's goal was to bring a sporty family car to the market that could be produced in large quantities. Maserati was already known for its luxury and that did not change at all. The arrival of the Biturbo also meant the introduction of some unprecedented technologies that made the engine's power almost go off the charts.\n\nAlessandro De Tomaso is an Italian racing driver, and founder of the sports car brand De Tomaso, with Argentinian roots who took over Maserati from Citroen in 1975. He was the man who aimed to generate revenue in the nearly bankrupt Maserati. His plan was to develop a sporty, luxurious, yet affordable family car that the public would crave, ultimately saving Maserati from collapse. Dictum factum: in 1981 the Maserati Biturbo hit the market. It was an accessible family car with a 'small' 2.0-liter V6 engine that was cheap to buy and low on taxes in Italy. Neighbouring countries had significantly lower road taxes, which is why Maserati designed larger V6 engines for export.\n\nThe engine incorporates unprecedented and innovative technology. Each cylinder was equipped with three valves that maintained high gas speeds at a low RPM, which were then complemented by two turbochargers that responded early during acceleration. In the S-version (sportier model), the turbochargers' effect is amplified by the intercooler, which is a radiator-like system that sends more air and fuel to the engine to create more power. Fellow car manufacturers were left speechless: at a time when they were still experimenting with turbochargers, Maserati had already launched a car with two turbochargers and an intercooler. The name Biturbo refers to the fact that the engine is equipped with these two power-boosting turbochargers.\n\nThe fashionable interior, which reveals that this car is of Italian origin, is also worth mentioning. The seats were designed by the famous Italian fashion house Missoni, and the meticulously finished leather centre console is equally impressive. Together, they create a stunning and very comfortable whole that exudes Italian luxury and elegance.\n\nIn 1994, it was decided to end the production of this guardian angel for Maserati. The total number of produced units stands at around 37,000, and the consensus is that it was a success story. Maserati had been saved from bankruptcy, and it can be argued that this car was responsible for it.\n\nMaserati Biturbo S\n\nThe Maserati Biturbo S is the sporty version of the already sporty Maserati Biturbo and was available from 1983 to 1984. This S-version was exclusively produced for the Italian market and delivered 25 more horsepower than the regular Biturbo. For export, an equivalent was designed under the name Maserati Biturbo ES, the only difference was a bigger engine capacity.\n\nApparently only 150 units of this Italian S-version were made. Four decades after production, it is unclear how many of them are still in good condition, but the fact remains that this car was already rare when it was new and is becoming increasingly rare. It is guaranteed to be a rewarding investment!\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 415 (164 inch)\nWidth (cm): 171 (67inch)\nHeight (cm): 131 (51 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 251 (99 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1086 (2394 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 2.0L V6 front-engine with 2 IHI turbos and an intercooler\nValve gear: 18 (3 for each cylinder)\nFuel system: 1 Weber twin-choke carburettor\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 205 hp (151 kW) at 6500 t/m\ntorque: 253 Nm at 3200 t/m\nTop speed: 221 km/h (137 mph)"}

{"name": "1992 MAZDA MX5 PLUS HARDTOP - €14,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 90368 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Belgian MOT\nEarly Miata, first engine type\nHard top and spoiler\nBest sold convertible ever\n \n\nThe Mazda MX-5 - or \"Miata\" in the United States and \"Eunos Roadster\" in Japan - is a compact and lightweight roadster that has earned and acquired sports car accolades and allure over the years. In 1989, the MX-5 was introduced to the public at the Chicago Auto Show, but the story behind it began exactly a decade earlier in 1979. As of writing, the fourth generation of the MX-5 is now being sold as the \"best-selling Open Two-Seater (OTS) in the world,\" which indicates that this sports car continues to be a hit and does not need to fight to be prominent in daily traffic.\n\nIn 1979, Kenichi Yamamoto, engineer at Mazda, and Bob Hall, automotive journalist, met in an interview. The Japanese engineer scornfully asked the journalist what gaps there were on American roads. Hall answered briefly: \"(affordable) roadsters.\" The oil crisis, and the absurdly strict American traffic laws, had left wounds, and caused cars to be used solely for functional purposes, thus roadsters disappeared from traffic and production even stopped. Two years later, in 1981, Bob Hall started working at Mazda USA, and unsuspectingly he would become the father of the car that would fill his ‘roadster void’. In 1989, eight years and many prototypes later, the Mazda eXperiment 5 (MX-5) was released. Over the years, four generations have been released on the market, each undergoing noticeable aesthetic or mechanical changes. The different generations are distinguished according to an alphabetical chronology: NA, NB, NC, and ND. The ND is the fourth generation and currently the last version that is still in production.\n\nThe long-rounded hood, short rear end, modest dimensions, and charming look provide a good imitation of British roadsters from brands such as MG and Triumph. The MX-5 was a tribute to the extinct British roadsters from the sixties in the US. All aspects that harmoniously co-operate with a four-cylinder engine that produces approx. 115 horsepower (or more in later models) and guarantee fun in a car that weighs only 950 kg. The car offers a versatile and accessible driving experience that appeals to both young and old.\n\nMazda MX-5 NA\n\nThe NA is the first generation of the MX-5 and was introduced to the public in 1989. The last NA was produced in 1998 and was succeeded by the NB. Due to the negative impact of US traffic regulations on roadsters, an alternative had to be created, which had to be the Mazda MX-5. The original version had a four-cylinder 1.6L engine that delivered 115 hp. In 1994, a 1.8L version with 131 hp was introduced, and in 1995, the power of the 1.6L version was reduced to 90 hp, though only for the European market. The reduction to 90 hp made the NA more popular to neutral buyers that didn’t specifically crave for engine power.\n\nThanks to its – as mentioned - enjoyable driving experience, charming look with pop-up headlights, and affordability. The NA is a great entry-level roadster for people who seek a pleasant driving experience with subtle sporty touches and don't want a fortune to be spent on it.

The car is powered by a powerful 4.9-liter V8 engine that produces 306 horsepower.\n\nAfter six years of Ghibli, Maserati decides to stop production and it was in the 90s that Maserati nostalgically looks back at its history and the beautiful Ghibli. They decide to restart an era. Based on the Biturbo’s predecessor, they decide to launch a new Ghibli. In 1992, the world was first exposed to a second version, with model code AM336. It was presented again at the Turin Motor Show. This time Marcello Gandini had the pleasure of designing the car, another seasoned designer who knew what to do. From 1992, the new Ghibli, based on the Biturbo, is equipped with a V6 engine that was considerably smaller in capacity with 2.0 litres, due to market demand. Also a larger 2.8L engine is designed for non-European markets. Despite the smaller engine, it did not disappoint, the 302 horses make the car accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometres an hour (0-60 mph) in less than six seconds.

There was a range of engines available: a 3.0L biturbo V6 engine, a 3.8L V8 diesel engine, or a monoturbo 3.0L V6 engine. The engine was handled by an automatic eight-speed transmission. As of writing, the M157 has been in production for an exact decade, and Maserati doesn't seem to have any plans in discontinuing it.\n\nMaserati Ghibli SS\n\nThe Ghibli SS was revealed in 1969 and is therefore part of the first Ghibli edition. True to tradition, it is once again a stunningly designed car with an impressive engine architecture. Under the hood, there is a powerful V8 engine that almost hits the 5.0-liter engine capacity boundary. The engine produces 330 horsepower, a power output that left jaws dropping at that time.\n\nOnly 425 models of the Ghibli SS were sold and manufactured in total. This limited production quantity contributes to the soaring value of this Ghibli SS. The Ghibli SS combines the elegance of a beauty with the power of a beast.

The Ferrari was supplied new by Maranello Sales Ltd in Egham, Surrey and supplied new to a hotel at Hamilton Place on Park Lane, London. Supplied new on the 1st August 1987, its first service was carried just weeks later at Maranello Concessionaires Ltd at 1318 miles. Maranello Concessionaires Ltd carried out the cars first three services (6250, 12500 and 18750 – precise mileage at service was 17102) and from 1990 Strattons Ferrari Service in Cheshire maintained the car with services at 18233, 22214 and 25300 miles.\nFrom 1993 Graypaul Motors Division began maintaining the car, stamping the service book at 27234, 28300, 29249 and in 1996 29456 miles. Former, now retired York prestige car specialists Philip Welch began looking after the Ferrari from 1997 with services at 31322, 33456, 35198, 36313, 36721, 37137, 37377 and for the last time in 2004 at 37588 miles. An alternative York specialists then serviced the 328GTS at 37932 and 38572 miles, and Neal Lucas Ferrari Specialist serviced the car at 41910 miles. In 2014 the most recent owner purchased the Ferrari, at the time based in Oxfordshire but now living very close to us in a village on the outskirts of Malton.\n\nAfter initial purchase in 2014 the Ferrari was serviced again by Neal Lucas at 43212 miles. A thorough check over was carried out and the car prepared for the new owner to take the car to his home in France where it has spent some of the past nine years. During ownership around 3000 miles have been covered in the car but now at 92 years old the Ferrari isn't getting enough use so the difficult decision to sell the car has now come. Over the recent ownership the car has been superbly maintained with Neal Lucas carrying out work at 43665 and 44290 miles and then R&D Automotives in Manchester began maintaining the car with a service and timing belts at 45392 miles, a further annual service, sump pan gaskets, gearchange oil seal and water pump gasket at 45604 miles, and in 2021 an annual service, new brake flexible hoses and overhauled calipers at 45732 miles.\n\nSince then, the Ferrari has had very little local use but each year it has been MOT tested locally and checked over. Ahead of arriving with us it was put through an MOT and then driven here and we can confirm the Ferrari is mechanically in excellent condition as expected with its low mileage and of course, impressive maintenance history. The car offers first class performance with an excellent engine and gearbox and is a true delight on the road with sharp braking and excellent handling. Condition wise the car is stunning with excellent bodywork and paintwork, wheels are in excellent order, the engine bay and under bonnet compartment well-presented and the upholstery very original, lovely and correct. Overall, this is a very genuine, top quality original car that has had careful owners over its entire life. The Ferrari comes with original service books and manuals, original tool kit and is a sharp, excellent driving example with fantastic history and a superb low mileage."}

Whilst still very much a full-size luxury saloon, it had a performance edge with a sports suspension setup and adaptive damping control, albeit the 6.75-litre Rolls-Royce V8 engine fitted to the car did not carry the turbocharger found on more powerful models.\n\nIn 1998, a final derivative of the Brooklands model was announced - the Brooklands R Mulliner. This featured a suspension upgrade (‘R’=Roadholding package, borrowed from the Turbo R model), five-spoke alloy wheels and the engine was fitted with a “light-pressure” turbo, boosting power output to a claimed 300 bhp. These cars were specially trimmed, furnished and badged and a limited run of only 100 vehicles were made, before production of the Brooklands ceased at the end of that year.\n\nThis particular car is number 22 of the limited edition and was first registered, new in the UK, in June 1998. In 2011 it was purchased by the former Seigneur (Lord of the Manor) of St. John, Jersey and imported into the island for use as his chauffeur-driven limousine. It has covered only a limited mileage since that time and, as might be anticipated, has been cosseted and kept in fine condition.\n\nThe Bentley is in excellent mechanical condition having been fully inspected, some electrical issues attended to and a major service undertaken in our workshops by a RR trained engineer. The works included new brake discs & pads, front tyres and suspension spheres. The car drives very well and the controls function as they should. For reference the head gasket, which has been noted as a fault with this model, was replaced at 64,000 miles whilst it was still in the UK. There is an assortment of old receipts and paperwork relating to works on the car over the years and the Seigneur also employed a mechanic / valeter who cared for the cars in his prestigious collection.\n\nThe handsome Peacock Blue paintwork is in first-rate condition and suits the imposing nature of the car perfectly. Unusually, the car features (original) chrome-finished wheels and a chrome radiator shell, fitted as optional extras from new.\n\nAs might be anticipated, the interior of the car is highly specified and a sumptuous place to be. The Ivory leather interior is near immaculate, with a factory fitment, colour coordinated steering wheel. The carpets and headlining are both excellent, as is the highly polished interior woodwork. The car has a number of luxury extras fitted - satellite navigation; DVD/CD player; parking sensors and television screens in the rear of the front seats.\n\nThis is a very good example of a classic sporting Bentley - produced in limited numbers - which has been well looked after, has had modest use in recent years (now showing 78,000 miles) and remains in excellent condition. A most luxurious, fast motor car with a solid feel befitting its status as a product from a prestigious marque.\n\nThe car is currently Jersey registered and we can assist with shipping and importing processes if required."}

An engine upgrade to the GTS boosted the power and torque, and it uses the more seductive wide body from the four-wheel drive models.  A special intake manifold, with six rather than one single flap, switches between power and torque-optimised maps.  Thus, the output of the 3.8-litre flat six is raised from 380 BHP at 6500 rpm to 408 HP at 7300rpm, and although the torque figure remains at 311 lb/ft, it is produced at 200 rpm lower.\n\nThe Porsche 997 GTS blends the very best of the sports models in the Carrera range with the equipment level of the luxury derivatives. The GTS combines the high performance of the racetrack-inspired models with an everyday sportiness. With more power, and solid road holding, the GTS provides the best combination of power and handling.\n\nThe 997 GTS models are certainly increasing in desirability, as their reputation for being amongst the best modern Porsches grows.  Supplied new by Porsche Centre Exeter in March 2011, it has a full Porsche service history (5 stamps), order form, Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, handbook pack, spare remote key, and accompanying dealer invoices.  This immaculate GTS is not one to be missed.  It will also be supplied with a comprehensive 12-month written warranty.\n\nAvailable to view at our London showrooms."}

{"name": "2012 PORSCHE 911 (997.2) CARRERA 4 GTS PDK - £69,995 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 23200 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "PDK 7-speed gearbox with paddle shift, 40% locking differential, Alcantara and leather heated Sports seats with crest embossed headrests, Exclusive Sports Chrono Package Plus with white dial timer, climate control, PCM Navigation with Bluetooth, Bose Sound Package with Universal Audio Interface, Exclusive white instrument dials, rear centre console painted in exterior colour, Sports Design front apron, stainless steel door entry guards, 19” centre lock alloys with colour crested centres, Sports exhaust, Sports steering wheel in Alcantara, Alcantara handbrake and gear lever, rear Park Distance Control, Xenon headlamps, rain sensor, top tinted windscreen, rear wiper, carpet mats. VTS tracker also fitted.\nThe 911 has captivated drivers for 50 years, and this Porsche GTS is no exception. The Porsche 911 (997) Carrera GTS, is the sportiest 911 Carrera model ever built.  It uses the more seductive 44 mm-wider body which gives the GTS a more aggressive stance. An engine upgrade boosts power and torque also features a whole host of other options; a special intake manifold, with six rather than one single flap, switches between power and torque-optimised maps. Thus, the output of the 3.8-litre flat six is raised from 380 BHP at 6500 rpm to 408 HP at 7300rpm, and although the torque figure remains at 311 lb/ft, it is produced at 200 rpm lower. It has a faster throttle response and accelerates even faster. Porsche Traction Management, all-wheel drive, ensures optimised driving dynamics, especially in wet or snowy conditions.\n\n10-times World Rally Champion Walter R hrl said of the GTS, “As wide as a Turbo and as sharp as a GT – The 911 Carrera GTS has all the racing genes of Porsche and is 100% 911.”  \n\nThis Carrera 4 GTS coupe is sure to increase in collectability due to its rarity. Supplied by Porsche Centre, Leicester in March 2012, it has a complete service history record with Porsche Centres and Porsche specialists and a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity. Our Carrera 4 GTS is certainly not one to be missed. It will also be supplied with a written 12-month comprehensive warranty cover."}

Excellent car and will be sad when it leaves. It is extremely well built. Service history. Car is SORN and MoT expired.

Good points: Engine and gearbox very good. Have disconnected the battery. Once the bad points are fixed this will be a great car. Remote central locking.

The powers were respectively 85 and 75 hp, later the 1,301 cm3 will increase to 78 hp. In 1987, Lancia introduced the Delta HF Integrale, which replaced the HF Turbo. It was built in 5000 copies to be homologated \"race\", but its success was such that 2500 more were manufactured. Two other models will follow: the Evoluzione 1 and the Evoluzione 2. The Delta HF differed from the Delta sedan by larger bumpers, an air intake on the hood, 4 powerful twin headlights, domed wings to allow for wider tires, etc. The Lancia Integrale won the World Rally Championships in 1988 and 1989. It was followed by the Integrale 16 V, and Evoluzione who also won a multitude of races."}

Jaguar XK-E) was a British sports car, manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd between 1961 and 1974. Its combination of good looks, high performance and competitive pricing established the marque as an icon of 1960s motoring. More than 70,000 E-Types were sold.  In March 2008, the Jaguar E-Type ranked first in a The Daily Telegraph online list of the world's \"100 most beautiful cars\" of all time!\n\nIn 2004, Sports Car International magazine placed the E-Type at number one on their list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s.\n\nSeries III\n\nA new 5.3 L twelve-cylinder Jaguar V12 engine was introduced, with uprated brakes and standard power steering. The short wheelbase FHC body style was discontinued and the V12 was available only as a convertible and 2+2 coupe. The convertible used the longer-wheelbase 2+2 floorplan. The Series 3 is easily identifiable by the large cross-slatted front grille and flared wheel arches, and a badge on the rear that proclaims it to be a V12. Cars for the US market were fitted with large projecting rubber bumper over-riders (in 1973 these were on front, in 1974 both front and rear (clarification needed) to meet local 5 mph (8 km/h) impact regulations, but those on European models were considerably smaller. US models also have side indicator repeats on the front wings. There were also a very limited number of six-cylinder Series 3 E-Types built. These were featured in the initial sales literature. When leaving the factory the V12 Open Two Seater and V12 2+2 originally fitted Dunlop E70VR − 15 inch tyres on 15 × 6K wire or solid wheels, though British police forces would eschew this tyre and fit a higher performing 205/70VR15 Michelin XWX to their Series 3 E-Types.\n\n Specifications\nBodywork\nLength : cm (in): 469 (184.5)\nWidth : cm (in): 168 (66.1)\nHeight : cm (in): 131 (51.6)\nWheelbase : cm (in) : 267 (105.1)\nWeight: kg (lb) : 1565 (3450)\nMechanics.\nDisplacement : V12 5343 cc (326 ci), front mounted\nValve gear : 24\nFuel system : 4 Zenith carburettors\nGearbox : 4 speed manual\nDriven wheels : rear-wheel drive\nMaximum power : 272 bhp at 5850 rpm\nMaximum torque : 412 Nm at 3600 rpm\nMaximum speed : 236 km/h (147 mph)"}

The registration mark GDP 222L was issued in Reading, and the car supplied new by Morris Garages Limited in Oxford.\nThe MGB has a well-documented history and it was with the same family for around 30 years and has covered little 21,000 miles since a complete overhaul, re-trim, new hood, full bodyshell strip down, restoration and re-paint, and engine re-condition taking the car to a show standard level in 1989.

The cost of the restoration was over the value of the car in 1989, £9,685 and carried out by Bucks MG Centre. The invoice documenting all the work including new panels is with the history file.\n\nHaving had excellent maintenance and upkeep since 1989, the car still looks superb throughout, and is exceptional to drive. The bodywork is first class, and the Harvest Gold paintwork has a stunning gleam to it. Chrome work is of a very high standard, the chrome wire wheels are excellent and the upholstery has a lovely honest look and feel to it having being re-trimmed over 30 years ago. Whilst the car was rebuilt in 1989, it appears a very correct, original car still retaining its original colours and registration mark. The MGB is a delight to drive, it's been regularly serviced, the engine is super fit holding excellent oil pressure, the four speed gearbox and overdrive are smooth and the car is absolutely ideal for regular summer use, shows, events and touring. The MGB has been owned by one of our Derby based customers since March 2022 and shortly before arriving with us has been fully serviced so is on the button and ready to go."}

Powered by a 3. 1-litre Essex V6 engine driving the rear wheels through a five speed manual transmission, first registered on 7 August 1970. This Capri was overhauled between 1982 and 1988 by prior owner and well known car customiser Andy Saunders. As part of this work the standard body panels, running gear and engine were replaced with those of RS3100 specification, of which only 250 genuine examples were ever built at Ford’s Halewood plant. The engine was replaced with a 3.1-litre Essex V6 and tuned to produce 200bhp, while the standard transmission was upgraded from a four-speed to a five-speed unit. The car also received a full respray during this work to the Red and Black colour scheme it sports today. Having covered relatively low mileage since the aforementioned work was completed in the late 1980s, the bodywork on this Capri remains in generally very good condition. There are a few marks to the front end, along with some paint bubbling to the lower edges of both doors – and the door also appear to be in need of slight re-alignment. All four wheels remain in great shape. Inside, the cabin of this Capri remains largely in it's original guise, though the front seats have been upgraded to match the increased performance of the vehicle. These seats present in excellent condition with no sign of any heavy use, while the standard stereo has also been upgraded to a more modern offering and a later steering wheel is fitted. The door cards are beginning to show their age, with the passenger side in particular showing some wear-and-tear around the main door handle. Included with the car are a large number of receipts and invoices from when the car was rebuilt in the 1980's.

Rear wings are solid in all the right places (bottom of c pillars, fuel tank caps area all solid.) Door shuts all solid. Inner sills all good. Roof is good. Bottom of a pillar and scuttle is solid. Inner wings all look good. Front wings will need replacement as will front valence.  Underneath isn't to bad but will need work I expect. As will the sills. Possibly these can be saved with work but I would just renew personally. Rear arches are gone but this is localised. Rad leaks so can't run it for to long but a replacement refurbed rad is included with the sale. Interior is pieced together from various bits so will need work, it didn't have one when I got it apart from the door roll tops which are excellent. All the rare chrome is present bar the drivers side hockey stick trim with I will try to find a spare for. No bumpers or grill. Overall a cracking basis for restoration which is going up in value year on year. Pads have been removed so rolls freely and master cylinder isn't plumbed in so has no brakes at all. V5 present and in my name but no other history. I have loads of other photos I can send but of course with any old car it's best to come view."}

It was visually different from preceding Mondial models, the most recognizable being the redesign of the air intakes to a smaller, neater rectangular shape.

The Mondial t represented the most substantial upgrade to the Mondial model line in performance and handling since its introduction in 1980. Previous Mondials had rarely justified their price premium over the competition in terms of bare performance statistics, which led to some poor press coverage. The \"t\" offered greater performance whilst retaining a mid-engined layout and a practical packaging layout, and was more favorably received. It also had the advantage of two usable rear seats.

What makes Trevor unique is his history. He was used as an inspectors car for the electricity boards southern division until it retired in 1971. The inspector who used it put his name on one of the doors which I thought was pretty quirky. The other interesting thing about Trevor is that he is almost entirely original - I have never seen a Landy with all original parts before - all the numbers including the chassis number and engine number match the paperwork and there is nothing to suggest that the mileage is not genuine. Before I bought Trevor I purchased a HPI check and it came back 100 percent clear (albeit no valid MoT obviously) - therefore there were no mileage discrepancies found. I personally bought Trevor because of his originality and rarity (the series 2, not 2A, was the shortest running production Land Rover in the line up (from 1958 to 1961). I also thought his colour pattern was pretty unique. "}

I have classic car insurance which costs less than £50 per year. I had the coolant system repaired (new hand-built radiator from Denmark and valves, thermostat etc). In 2019 I had the braking system overhauled, plus new discs and pads and refurbished calipers (from the USA). I had clutch, master and slave cylinders replaced a couple of years back. It has had a new battery and a new heavy duty starter motor fitted. It has new manifold in 2019 and previously had a complete stainless-steel exhaust. In 2019 when I had the last bout of major work to it plus a major service, I also replaced the fuel tank. I also had some electrical work done so that all the electric windows and electric door mirrors work. The only thing I can think that doesn’t work on it is the boot release button - they are vacuum operated, so I think it just needs to be cleaned. The petrol release is also on a vacuum and that works fine. The boot struts could do with being replaced. The car isn’t in concourse condition but it is in very good condition. I have the original radio cassette player it came with, although I fitted a Kenwood CD player. Plus I have the original tool kit and even the Vinyl protective bag for the removal roof. I have the original handbook too. It even has the original branded number plates from the dealership in Leicester (Robinson’s Mazda) that originally supplied the car in 1986. There are only 9 generation 1 RX7s still on the road in the UK. In short, I have owned and loved this car for 21 years, this is a very (very) reluctant sale and if I don’t get the right price then I will happily keep it. The reason I am selling it is because I hardly drive it nowadays. In the last 5 years I have put around 1000 miles on it."}

The car was registered on 4th September 1973 and is a low mileage example recording just 62,200 miles with MOT certificates supporting the mileage back to 1984 at 46,553 miles. The E-Type has the highly desirable manual transmission and is finished in an excellent colour combination of British Racing Green with Biscuit upholstery and excellent chrome wire wheels with Pirelli tyres. The E-Type has a Black mohair hood and matching hood cover and the boot is lined correctly with Biscuit trim to match the inside of the car.\nWe sold this V12 to the most recent owner in North London back in 2016 and in the seven years of ownership around 4000 miles have been covered. Over this period over £10,000 has been spent on maintenance and upgrades and the E-Type returns to us in exceptional condition. Work has included a modified oil filter unit, the differential has been removed for overhaul (new bearings and seals) l and new brake calipers, trailing arms, and bushes. The E-Type has also had new propshaft UJ's, brake pads, handbrake pads. Further expenditure includes a new set of Blockley tyres, new header tank, two front brake hoses, new lower ball joints and full carburettor conversion. Prior to leaving us in 2016, as part of the sale agreement over £3000 was spent on a new mohair hood, new starter motor, new exhaust mountings and various other minor maintenance and service work.\n\nThis outstanding E-Type presents superbly, and we can confirm it returns to us is in top class condition throughout. The bodywork is truly exceptional with beautiful straight panels and excellent gaps. The car has a stunning, clean underside and inner wheel arches are pristine. The bulkhead and space frame are in excellent condition with no corrosion issues and the bonnet is also first class. The spare wheel well is presented in excellent order and is painted correctly in body colour. This British Racing Green paintwork is exceptional with a stunning glass finish that is perfectly complimented by stunning chrome work and the excellent wheels and recently replaced tyres.\n\nThe upholstery is beautiful. On first glance the interior trim could be mistaken for almost new, but on closer inspection its clear this is a beautifully aged, high quality interior that has been superbly well cared for. The leather seats are beautiful, the carpets have nicely aged and door cards and dash board are excellent. The steering wheel is excellent, as are the correct dials, chrome interior trims and rubber seals. The glass is in excellent order and everything functions and works correctly as expected.\n\nOn the road TSN 332M does not disappoint. The V12 E-Type is comfortable, quick, easy to drive and ideal for long distance touring. The power assisted steering is light, the brakes are sharp and efficient, the suspension in excellent order and from looking under the bonnet its clear the suspension and brake components are all in excellent order and have even been kept in excellent cosmetic order. The V12 engine is top class with exciting performance, excellent oil pressure and correct cooling. The four speed manual gearbox is faultless and the rebuilt rear axle superb. The E-Type is very quick and must be driven to be fully appreciated. The car is wonderful on the road, its quiet, free from squeaks, knocks and rattles and is amongst the very best driving E-Type's we see.The E-Type has been with its most recent owner for seven years, the owner prior to these thirteen years and before that the car was with one owner from the early/mid 1990's.\n\nThe E-Type only records four former keepers from new and comes with a comprehensive file of receipts, MOT certificates and tax discs. The file of receipts confirms the vehicle has been particularly well maintained and having covered around 16,000 miles since 1984, we know the car has spent more time being detailed in the garage than used on the road over the past thirty years or so.

Based on a shortened DB7 platform, the Zagato employed the 435bhp V12 powerplant mated to a short-throw 6-speed manual transmission. The distinctive styling, including Zagato’s trademarked “double-bubble” roof, evoking strong memories of the iconic DB4 GT Zagato from the 1960s, not to mention the stunning driveline from the most focused DB7 built, the GT, ensured that the orderbook for all 99 cars was quickly fulfilled.\n\nBodied mostly in aluminium by Carrozzeria Zagato in Italy, the car was almost 60kg lighter than the standard DB7 GT giving it a suitably enhanced turn of speed over its mechanically similar stablemate. The lighter-weight DB7 Zagato, was estimated to be capable of around 190 mph and able to reach 60 mph in comfortably under 5 seconds.\nThe DB7 Zagato, 20 years on from launch, has established itself amongst Aston Martin enthusiasts worldwide, for its driving performance and distinctive styling which has since proved itself to have been ahead of its time.\n\nThis example, first registered in January 2004 has been lovingly cared for throughout its life and benefits from a comprehensive servicing and maintenance regime at Aston Martin main agents and recognised marque specialists, including its most recent service in October 2022. An Aston Martin sports exhaust ensures that it sounds as good as it looks! Having covered just 9,000 miles from new, condition is superb throughout.\n\nThis sublime Anglo-Italian thoroughbred is a significant part of the marque’s history and has proved to be a fast-appreciating model within the legions of Aston Martin sports GT cars.\nSupplied with an extensive bespoke history folder and a model relevant distinctive number plate, this DB7 Zagato is Available to view now, at our Hertfordshire showrooms."}

An historic partnership, which first produced the iconic DB4 GT Zagato of 1960 and has, over a 60+ year period, produced a unique collection of high-performance Aston Martin cars, all in extremely small numbers, all with lighter weight than production variants and all with ‘trade mark’ distinctive Zagato body styling and interior features.\n\nThe V12 Zagato, clothed in lightweight hand formed aluminium and carbon fibre body panels, is sculpted with signature ‘double bubble’ rooflines and accentuated rear wheel arches, in true Zagato tradition. From the unique ‘Z’ pattern front grille to the rear wings and tailgate, diffuser and splitter’s, formed from carbon fibre, every aspect of the distinctive Zagato styling contributes to give the V12 Vantage a purposeful and menacing appearance, whilst reducing the car’s total weight, by circa 150Kg’s.\n\nIn total, just 61 V12 Zagato’s (including two pre-production cars) were manufactured and supplied to appreciative collectors and enthusiasts, with many now forming part of celebrated collections world-wide.\nUsing data supplied by the Aston Martin Heritage Trust, our research confirms this car to be one of only 18 right hand drive examples and the only right-hand drive car finished in Black.\n\nThe UK specified example, we are delighted to offer, finished in AML Carbon Black with Obsidian black semi-aniline hides, is fitted with optional sports seats, full gloss black road wheels, carbon fibre A-pillar finishers and door mirror caps, black textured exhaust tailpipes and black brake callipers.\n\nEach V12 Zagato, was constructed upon the highly respected V12 Vantage VH platform and running gear, with 510bhp and 570 NM of torque produced by the sonorous 6.0 litre V12 engine. Mated to a 6-speed manual transaxle and with significantly lower weight than its regular production brethren, overall performance in all respects, was lifted to a new and outstanding level.\n\nWith just 1,781 miles covered from new, the car being offered is in immaculate condition throughout and benefit’s from professionally applied, ceramic paint protection. First registered in the Channel Islands, if staying in the UK, Taxes will require payment prior to release for UK registration.\n\nDuring the last ownership, regular maintenance of this exceptional car, has been carried out by Aston Martin Agents and the car professionally stored in climate-controlled conditions, when not in use.\n\nAvailable for viewing now by appointment only."}

It was the first Aston Martin convertible to feature a power-operated soft top, which could be raised or lowered in just 30 seconds.\n\nThe Virage Volante was powered by a 5.3-liter V8 engine, which produced 330 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. It was capable of reaching a top speed of 150 mph and could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 6.5 seconds.\n\nThe Virage Volante was designed by John Heffernan, who was also responsible for the design of the Virage coupe. It featured a sleek, aerodynamic body with a low-slung stance and a long hood. The interior was luxurious and featured hand-stitched leather seats and a high-end sound system.\n\nThroughout its production run from 1990 to 2000, the Virage Volante underwent several updates and improvements. In 1992, the engine was upgraded to produce 350 horsepower, and in 1996, the car received a facelift with updated styling and a new dashboard.\n\nToday, the Aston Martin Virage Volante is considered a classic car and is highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. Its timeless design and powerful performance make it a true icon of the Aston Martin brand.\n\nThis Volante was purchased by one of the original engineers involved with the build of the car and so much was not included at the time of initial build, so this car was acquired and dismantled and ready for re-build to meet how an engineer would have built the car without any cost reduction. The engine was rebuilt, a totally new steering and suspension set up was re-engineered with completely new geometry and ride heights. Transmission changes and later wheels and tyres. The brakes have been completely re-designed and out-perform any standard Volante. The hood mechanism with separate window closure, electrical modifications with later software installed. The car is now how the original Volante should have been, it is crazy how this car drives, preforms, rides and brakes a true great all-round grand tourer convertible. The car has been re-painted in the original specification and totally re-trimmed with 'a new hood covering. Who knew a Virage Volante could drive like this?"}

New hood, all new brakes (pipes, cylinders, pads, front discs and calipers, new shoes and rear cylinders), new fuel pump, carbs rebuilt and many many other things! The only piece I haven't been able to locate is the inners for the engine breather, there is a temporary modern one on there at the moment. It is a genuine overdrive Mk2 Vitesse that has had a restoration many years ago but it still looks good. The car now drives and has MX5 front seats, but I do have the originals with the runners, but no base. There is also a tonneau cover but that won't fit with the ultra comfortable MX5 seats. The car now needs little bits to make it even better - but my skills and enthusiasm are not up to it. The storage for the car is also going and I couldn't leave such a lovely old car outside in the rain. I don't use the car and life is too busy so it's time for someone to tune it up, fix the panel gaps, sort out the windows so they go up and down smoothly. I'm sure there are many other things too - it's a 53 year old car that I don't know any history. Any questions - just ask and I will try to answer them."}

The trinity of originality, provenance and condition are often dreamt about in the world of classic motoring, however APY 267 is one of the rare occasions when all three collide. Such is the originality that the even the 89-year-old leather seats are still in service today and while showing signs of use, they add to the authenticity of AYP 267. The most extensive history file shows that the previous owner sent the car to Sturge Conservation Studio to have the leather professionally treated in 2016. Furthermore, looking at a photograph taken of the car in 1934, it would also suggest that the original side screens have survived and are neatly stored in the rear of the car. As for condition, the history folder includes numerous invoices for work carried out to maintain and improve the engine, gearbox and bodywork. If they were totalled up they would go a long way to the asking price of the vehicle. While in the care of the Bonhams Motor Car Department, AYP 267 was treated to an engine rebuild and a repaint. These are only two items from a list of invoices stretching to no less than 35 pages. As a result, the engine pulls very well, maintains strong oil pressure and does not burn any oil. The car is believed to have had only 7 owners from new, including the well known Topham family of Aintree racecourse fame, prominent collector Nick Mason and the Bonhams Motoring Department. The history file confirms that the previous owners have maintained AYP 267 without a moment’s hesitation and there are records of the extensive investments which have been made in this motor car. AYP 267 is available for inspection in London along with the extensive history file and current V5. "}

{"name": "1981 BMW 323 I BAUR 81 - €30,950 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Lowered price from €35.950 to €30.950\n\nIn May 1975, the 3 Series succeeded the BMW 2002.  It kept most of its characteristics, and added many evolutions, especially in terms of engines. At launch, it was the smallest model manufactured by BMW, which produced the 5 series, then the 6 and 7 series. It is also the best-selling BMW model in the world. The first 3 series appeared in 1975 to replace the 1502, 1602, 1802 and 2002 (E10/E20), of which it took over some engines. At launch, it was only available with a two-door body. It was also available as a convertible, bodied by Baur. It was designed by Paul Bracq who took up the general style of the 5 E12 series. As for the interior, it was particularly large for a car of this size. The first models were the 316, 318, 320 carburetor and 320i mechanical injection Bosh K-Jetronic, all equipped with four-cylinder engines of the M10 family. A new 1,990 cm3 six-cylinder engine was introduced in 1977 on the 320. This carburetor engine then develops 122 hp and replaces the old four-cylinder 320 and 320i. This 6-cylinder version is often referred to as the 320/6 in common usage in order to differentiate it from the 4-cylinder version (sometimes referred to as 320/4 by analogy). Then a second six-cylinder block (type M20B23) comes to top the range, a 2,316 cm3 with K-Jetronic injection of 143 hp on the 323i. A slight restyling was carried out in 1979 which, without losing its general line, made it more aggressive. Inside, the center console was modified, as well as the design and instrumentation. The most powerful models, 320i, 320/6 and 323i were identified at first glance thanks to their four-headlight grille with front monogram, although some 4-cylinder models were also equipped with them. The 323i also had a dual exhaust outlet, ventilated front disc and solid disc brakes at the rear. New interior trims appeared in 1980 to replace the old ones, the shape of the head restraints was also revised. In 1980, the 1,573 cm3 engine of the 316 was replaced by the 1,766 cm3 of the 318 but with a lower power of 90 chebaux, then the 318 was replaced by the 318i (\"i\" as injection, in this case Bosch's K-Jetronic injection). The 315 made its entry-level debut by taking over the 1,600 cm3 engine of the old 316. At the end of 1982, the new 3 series E30 replaced the E21, only the model 315 was produced until 1983. The E21 series was a huge success: more than 1,300,000 cars were built, all models combined.\n\n Specifications\nBodywork\nLength : cm / in: 435/171.5\nWidth : cm / in: 161/63.4\nHeight : cm / in: 138/54.3\nWheelbase : cm /in : 256/100.9\nCurb weight: kg / lb : 1135/2502\nMechanics.\nDisplacement : straight-six 2316 cc/141 cu in, front-mounted\nValve gear : 8\nFuel system : Bosch K-Jetronic injection\nGearbox : 5-speed manual\nDrive wheels : rear wheel drive\nLeft-hand drive\nMaximum power : 141 hp at 6000 rpm\nMaximum torque : 190 Nm at 4500 rpm\nMaximum speed : 190 km/h/118 mph"}

The series 02 - especially the 2002 - became very popular in rally racing, further proving that German production cars are unmistakably distinguishing compared to cars with another ethnicity. Given its relatively long production period, from 1966 to 1977, and its influence on the highly acclaimed and well-known BMW series 3, the 02 is a must-have collector’s item for classic car enthusiasts.\n\nIt was in 1966 that BMW presented the 1600-2 at the Geneva Motor Show. It had to be the successor to the BMW sedan \"Neue Klasse\" (German for New Class) 1600. The 1600-2 was the sportier coupe with of course two doors instead of four. The name was soon given a new look: 1602, with the first two digits indicating the engine capacity and the last two digits indicating the series’ name 02. The 1602 was equipped with the BMW M10 engine, which is BMW's first four-cylinder engine since 1932 and delivered 85 horsepower.\n\nThe success of the 1602 didn’t remain unnoticed, and in response BMW decided to expand its range. In 1968, the BMW 2002 was introduced, which is a faster 02 with a larger engine that was powered by two Solex carburettors, which would later be replaced by mechanical injection. By introducing the BMW 1802 in 1971, BMW had chosen the golden mean: the 1802 was a 1766 cc engine car that was built to avoid the difficult buyer’s option between the 2002 and the 1602. Over the years, the 2002 was, reworked and improved, which made it able to prove its capacities on the rally circuit, for which it is still often used today. It was also the first production car with a turbo in 1974. As the icing on the cake, the 1502 was introduced in 1975, which is a smaller version of the 1602 that was meant to usher in the end of the 02’s era. Production was discontinued in 1977, partly due to the arrival of the series 3 as its successor. Ultimately, just over 800,000 02-series cars were delivered.\n\nThe BMW series 02 remains a highly coveted and sought-after classic. Thanks to its role as a precursor to the series 3, the catchy comfort-and-sport mix, and proof that regular BMW production cars could outdo rally cars in their own habitat.\n\nBMW 2002 Turbo\n\nIn 1973, BMW unveiled its 2002 Turbo. At first glance, this car appears to be an anachronism, oil rates were skyrocketing worldwide, as the 1973 oil embargo had just been put. Many feared the worst and therefore even speed limits were lowered on highways. Nevertheless, BMW boldly released a sports car to the market, and not just any sports car, one that would shape the future of automotive design. The 2002 Turbo was the first European production car to be turbocharged for increased power output.\n\nThe car's performance was mind-blowing for its time. Additionally, the BMW story that this car carries is what makes classic car enthusiasts drool over. As there’s only about 1,700 manufactured from 1973 to 1975, its value appears to be truly on the rise.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 422 (166 inch)\nWidth (cm): 163 (64 inch)\nHeight (cm): 141 (56 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 250 (98 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1080 (2381 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: four-cylinder turbocharged 1990 cc front-engine\nValve gear: 8\nFuel system: Kugelfischer P04 fuel injection\nGear box: 4-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 168 hp (125 kW) at 5800 t/m\ntorque: 245 Nm at 5800 t/m\nTop speed: 211 km/h (131 mph)"}

In 1976, it was revealed and was powered by a powerful six-cylinder engine, again representing German, in particular Bavarian automotive know-how. Over thirteen years of E24 production, BMW offered a wide range of options for this premature, yet superior 6 Series. BMW M also did with it what they do best: making BMW cars even more performant.\n\nThe E24 was meant to be the successor to the E9, which also was a two-door coupe that had the so-called ‘shark nose’ that empowered charisma and BMW characterizing power that reflects German craftsmanship. Under the hood, there is a six-cylinder inline engine that varies in power over the years, making - unintentionally - a wide 6-series range. In 1979, BMW left carburettors for the E24, as fuel injection was chosen for. From 1982, a different chassis was used, resulting in a facelift that brought several aesthetic and mechanical changes.\n\nThe E24 won a notable lot of races on the track, the most famous being two successive victories at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring and three victories at the 24 Hours of Spa. In 1989, production of the E24 ended and approximately 90,000 units sold. In 2003, BMW filled the 6-series gap again, bringing the E63 6-series back to life.\n\nBMW E24 M6/M635CSi\n\nIn 1984, BMW, along with BMW Motorsport, introduced an M version of the E24. At the time, BMW M was still relatively ‘inexperienced’, with only having made the M1 and the M5. Though, that doesn't mean that this M6 doesn’t offer amazing performance.\n\nFor Europe, ‘M635CSi’ was the reference, it was equipped with the 24-valve i6-engine from the M1 that produced about 280 horsepower. For the American market on the other hand, an S38 engine was used that produced 20 horsepower less, which is actually unnoticeable while driving.\n\nIn addition to its performance, the M6/M635CSi is equipped with plenty of cool features: heated seats in incredibly comfy leather seats, electric everything, air conditioning, even a refrigerator in the back. There is also a toolkit mounted in the trunk, although nobody knows why, since you will not need it as it is simply a BMW.\n\nOnly 1,767 American BMW M6s were built; 4,088 M635CSi counterparts. This car is becoming rarer and rarer, it can even be considered a collector's item that has set a trend for modern BMW M6 production.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nBody work\n\nLength (cm): 476 (187 inch)\nWidth (cm): 173 (68 inch)\nHeight (cm): 135 (53 inch)\nWheelbase (cm): 262 (103 inch)\nWeight (kg): 1619 (3569 lbs)\nMechanics\n\nEngine: 3453 cc in-line six-cylinder front-engine\nValve gear: 24, DOHC\nFuel system: Bosch ML-Jetronic\nGear box: 5-speed manual\nTransmission: RWD\nLeft-steered\npower: 260 hp (191 kW) at 6500t/m\ntorque: 330 Nm at 4500 t/m\nTop speed: 255 km/h (158 mph)"}

{"name": "1966 HILLMAN SUPER MINX - £9,950 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 66615 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "A real gem from 1966, this Hillman Super Minx is perfect for touring around and showing off to all. Produced from 1961-1967 the Hillman Super Minx was a slightly larger model than the standard Minx and this rare automatic Mark IV boasts a high specification, believed to be from factory, which presents in very good overall condition now for sale. The Mark IV Super Minx launched in October 1965 and built until 1967 with an enlarged engine capacity to 1725cc retaining the design changes from the Mark III. The automatic transmission is a Borg Warner 35, the same as that used in the likes of the MGB and the Triumph Stag. The exterior of the car finished in Kingfisher Blue, with a white bodyline, is in excellent condition and presents very nicely. The chrome trim has been reconditioned or replaced where necessary and breaks up the paintwork wonderfully. The car sits on white steel wheels with chrome hubs, wrapped in recent rubber with white spats to compliment the white bodyline. The interior of the car is in good condition, finished in black with black carpets and a light headliner, the cockpit is a pleasure to sit in. The car is fitted with separate front seats, believed to be from the factory, which was an optional extra at the time of production. The original wooden dash has signs of wear, and this may need some attention if required. There is a small tear in the driver’s seat which has been patch repaired, there is also the addition of ergonomic seatbelts in the front 2 seats. The back seat seems to have had very little use and presents excellently. The overhead valve four-cylinder engine used in the Super Minx’s have proven to be tough and reliable in service. This later 1725cc has the benefit of an extra main bearing unit (5 in total) increasing the specification top speed to 90mph. This engine outlived the Super Minx and was used in later models such as the Hunter and the Sunbeam Alpine. From what we can see, the engine has been kept in good condition and fluids have been changed regularly. The Borg Warner 35 automatic transmission is smooth (for the era), and the column shift arrangement is very easy to use. The kick down is effective at lower speeds and the car cruises with pleasure. The car was recommissioned in 2019 including the replacement of the rear shock absorbers and bushes and a rebuild of the front disc brakes. All in all this is a very good example of a Hillman Super Minx which we are delighted to offer on the market awaiting its next custodian. There is a mixture of paperwork to come with the car including its current V5, various owner’s manuals, a lovely set of Jack Brabham service cards and some previous MOT certificates. We will supply the car with 12 months MOT prior to its delivery or collection.

The car was registered in Nottingham, and had two owners in Derby before I became the third owner in 1985, also in Derby. At that time the car was in a sorry state suffering from severe rot. When I purchased the car, the chassis was so rotten that both doors needed to be closed to keep the back end of the car up! Over the next 20 years I spent time stripping the car down to the last nut and bolt, time and money permitting, I set about rebuilding the car but never making much progress - work always seemed to get in the way. With retirement on the horizon, I decided to have the car professionally rebuilt by Clive Manvers in 2010. The car underwent a total rebuild, body, chassis, engine, ancillaries, wiring, every last nut and bolt, and includes some modifications to improve handling, performance and reliability. After completion in February 2011, we took the car for a shakedown run for a few days in Norfolk. Having proved the rebuild and given the engine it's first 500 miles service it was ready for our planned trip to France, Italy, and the Alps. It was questioned at the time ‘will he’ make the trip? ‘Will he’ break down? So, he was christened Willie or Mr William as his full title and plans made for the trip in May 2011. Our concerns of him breaking down were unfounded as he ran perfectly and subsequent holidays to France and Italy have been faultless. Since the full rebuild in 2010/11 he has covered around 18,000 miles. The odometer presently shows around 6200 as he has gone round the clock. All paperwork and pictures over the last 37 years are available and include original log-book, heritage certificate, servicing, MoT’s and all bills detailing the extent of work carried out during this time. The car is offered for sale due to lifestyle changes and I will be sad to let him go but it is time to move on and let the car put a smile on someone else’s face. Price around £46500."}

Only 18700 miles from new. This cracking 500 SL has had just three owners from new and an exceptionally original example. Chassis number 002401 was supplied new by Regent Garage Gwynedd to local resident G. Thomas Esq on January 1st 1983. Befitting its status as Mercedes Benz's flagship sports car at the time the 500 SLs impressive specification encompassed a limited slip differential, cruise control, paint coat preservation, heat absorbing glass, headlamp wash / wipe, ABS brakes and rear seats. Sold by Mr Thomas to its next owner on June 1st 1995 for the princely sum of £27500 'NST369Y' its warranted to have covered just 18700 miles from new.\n\nThe engine bay has been sprayed with protective wax which has helped preserve various factory stickers on the 5 litre V8, while more Mercedes Benz stickers are visible on the exhaust silencer and one of the front brake callipers etc. This car has obviously not seen a wet road, and is beatifully preserved. A 'Regents Garage' sticker adorns the hardtops rear window and the unused spare wheel still wears its original Michelin XWX tyre. Obviously, much loved the 500 SLs appearance and condition belie it's thirty-seven years. It is amazing to think 2021 marks fifty years since the introduction of the R107 SL and there can be very few surviving UK supplied 500 SLs which are as original as NST369Y. This car comes with a V5, Mercedes Benz data card, history file and tool kit. The car is unmarked inside & out & is literally like it left the showroom.  It is the best example we have ever seen. Turn the ignition key and the five litre V8 fires instantly and upon test drive the engine pulls through the rev range and acceleration is brisk with the four-speed automatic gearchange being effortlessly smooth. A real pleasure to drive. If the seventies styling ticks your box and you want a classic that combines a stylish driving experience with the ability to deliver you to your destination unflustered then this beautiful SL could well be for you.

This car has been maintained without regard to cost, properly serviced with new tyres fitted etc.\n\nAs indicated by its title, 1988 marked the 35th anniversary for Corvette, and so it was decided that Chevrolet should commemorate the milestone by introducing an anniversary-edition model.  While this concept was not new to Corvette (Chevrolet had previously introduced a “Silver Anniversary” Corvette in 1978), this anniversary car was the first of its kind in a decade, given that Chevrolet opted not to manufacture a Corvette in 1983 (which would have marked Corvette’s 30th anniversary).\n\nThe 35th Anniversary Edition Corvette was very much a car of its time.  It comes finished in a “Miami-Vice-esque” triple white finish.  The car features a bright white body which is offset by a black roof halo and windshield frame accompanied by a transparent acrylic roof panel.  Most of the car’s exterior accents are also finished in bright white, including the door handles, mirrors, the bodyside moldings and the car’s 17-inch wheels.  On its interior, the car received white leather seats, a white center console cover, white interior door trim and a white steering wheel.  Even the floormats, which are finished in graphite, included a thin white band around their edges.\n\nThe car is in perfect order with everything working &is absolutely ready for use & will be sold fully serviced."}

Number 50 of 50 & utterly collectable.\n\nThe Aston Martin Vanquish is a grand tourer introduced by British luxury automobile manufacturer Aston Martin in 2001 as a successor to the Aston Martin Vantage (1993).\n\nThe first-generation of the V12 Vanquish, designed by Ian Callum and unveiled at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show, was produced from 2001 to 2007 as the flagship of the marque. The concept car, known as \"Project Vantage\" and the first Aston Martin design wholly styled by Callum, was built by the Ford Motor Company with craftsman Dilip Chhabria to display the company's vision for a future sports car to represent Aston Martin after the discontinuation of the Virage-based Vantage. \n\nThe Aston Martin V12 Vanquish was styled by Ian Callum and drew inspiration from the DB4 GT Zagato, projecting a more aggressive presence than Callum's DB7 Vantage. The production car closely resembled the Project Vantage Concept which debuted with a V12 engine at the North American International Auto Show in January 1998. \n\nUnderneath, the V12 Vanquish car featured a bonded aluminium composite chassis with a carbon fibre backbone developed in partnership with Lotus, an advanced independent suspension, and a more highly tuned version of the naturally aspirated 5,935 cc.\n\nAston Martin V12 engine that had debuted in the DB7 two years earlier. It was available in 2+0 and 2+2 seating configurations and came only in a coupé body style.\n\nThe Aston Martin V12 Vanquish S debuted at the 2004 Paris Motor Show, with a number of subtle styling revisions.\n\nThe end of the Vanquish's production run was celebrated with the Vanquish S Ultimate Edition. Aston Martin announced that the last 50 cars built would have a new 'Ultimate Black' exterior colour, upgraded interior, and personalised sill plaques\n\nThis Aston Martin Vanquish S Ultimate Edition number 50 of 50 was first delivered in June 2007 one of ONLY 20 right hand drive cars and one of the most original in outstanding condition.

A total of 645 examples were produced at an average selling price of £150,000. \n\nThe name was derived from the Lagonda marque that Aston Martin had purchased in 1947. Aston Martin was facing severe financial pressure in the mid-1970s and needed something to bring in some much-needed funds. Traditionally, Aston Martin had worked on 2+2 sports cars, but the Lagonda was a four-door saloon with a brand new V8 engine used in the two door Aston Martin V8. \nAs soon as it was introduced, it drew in hundreds of deposits from potential customers and in so doing, helped Aston Martin's cash reserves.\n\nThe car was designed by William Towns in an extreme interpretation of the classic 1970s ‘folded paper’ style. It was as unconventional a design then as it is now. Car enthusiasts are fiercely divided on the car's aesthetic value.\nThroughout the history of the marque, these handbuilt Lagonda's were amongst the most expensive saloons in the world. \nThe Lagonda was the first production car in the world to use computer management and a digital instrument panel. The Lagonda combined striking styling with opulent, club-like leather interior, and then-state-of-the-art instrumentation. Coupled to a three-speed automatic transmission its quad-cam carburettor/fuel injection V8 provided powerful performance when required.\n\nThis stunning Aston Martin V8 Lagonda Series IV was supplied to the original owner on 10th August 1989, he kept the car for some 27 years supported by an outstanding service record. The car was sold to an avid collector who loved and cherished the Lagonda for 11 years. The current vendor, another fastidious collector, purchased the car on 11th November 2017. Whilst the car has done little work of late, it has been exceedingly well cared for and as such, presents in beautiful condition. Finished in Winchester Blue with Parchment interior piped in blue, this automatic Aston Martin V8 Lagonda is also supplied with some unique, custom made, matching suitcases.\n\nThe original invoice is in the file together with correspondence between the factory and the first owner, there are also a large number of service invoices from the Newport Pagnell based manufacturer. Aesthetically a futuristic design, the interior is an area of beauty with deep comfortable seats, walnut in plentiful supply and a dashboard that, by any standards, was classed as state-of-the art. This desirable Series 4 Aston Martin V8 Lagonda beautiful example is UK registered and comes with a V5C registration document, the original service books and a history folder. To be expected of such a low mileage example, she drives with no known faults and is ready to enhance a private collection. One thing is for sure, driving this car will put a smile on your face and a wave from any passer by."}

It was designed by Ian Callum and manufactured at Aston Martin's plant in Newport Pagnell, UK.\n\nThe V12 Vanquish was powered by a 5.9-liter V12 engine, which produced 460 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. It had a top speed of 190 miles per hour and could accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 4.5 seconds.\n\nThe car featured an aluminum and carbon fiber body, which made it both strong and lightweight. It also had a 6-speed manual paddle shift transmission, carbon-ceramic disc brakes, and an adaptive suspension system.\n\nThe V12 Vanquish received praise for its stunning design, exceptional performance, and advanced technology. It appeared in the James Bond film \"Die Another Day\" in 2002, further boosting its popularity.\n\nIn 2004, Aston Martin introduced a limited-edition V12 Vanquish S, which had an upgraded engine, producing 520 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque. It also had a redesigned body, a new suspension system, and several other improvements.\n\nProduction of the V12 Vanquish ended in 2005, with a total of 2,578 units produced. It remains a highly coveted car among collectors and enthusiasts, valued for its impressive performance and elegant design.\n\nThis concours winning car is probably the BEST prepared Vanquish and is fitted with the SDP (Sports Dynamics Pac) which went on to be the Vanquish S without the super light weight wheels. The car started life as the company demonstrator being the car used for PR and customer demonstration use.

Engine rebuilt by TD guru George Epney and only driven 250 miles since, super condition throughout. \nFollowing on from the TC, the MG TD arrived. WIth its rigid box section chassis frame featured independent double wishbone front suspension, a well located 'live' rear axle, four wheel drum brakes, a hidden reinforced scuttle hoop, rack and pinion steering. With sharper handling and smoother riding. Powered by a twin carb, four cylinder XPAG 1,200cc engine allied to four speed manual transmission. The 54bhp TD was capable of 80 mph and 26 mpg. In 1950 this high performance version was released called the TDC. Featuring Andrex shock absorbers in addition to the standard items, larger 1.5\" carburettors with increased inlet ports, right side bonnet bulge to clear the large carbs, larger intake manifold and air cleaner, larger valves, increased compression ratio, higher rev limit to 6,000RPM, higher axle ratio, twin electric fuel pumps and lines with a higher performance ignition coil. Only 1,710 were made between 1950 and 1953, with virtually all being exported. The high compression engine was not suitable for the UK market, thanks to the continued operation of wartime fuel restrictions. As confirmed by MG Octagon Car Club correspondence on file, this MG TDC is one of 32 that left the factory in 1952 all destined for North America, where it remained until 2018, when it was exported to The Netherlands, and brought to the UK later that year. When they acquired the car it was in a dismantled state, but was complete and almost rust free. Two years were spent restoring it to the wonderful condition it is in today. The full extent of the work carried out is far too detailed to list in this advert, however is amply covered by invoices and photos on file. The engine rebuild was done alongside a reconditioning of the gearbox, suspension and chassis. "}

{"name": "1951 BENTLEY SPECIAL MARK VI - £80,000 ", "transmission": " N/A", "mileage": " 8191 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Featured on the Front cover of Bentley Specials and Special Bentleys by Ray Roberts, a bible to many Bentley enthusiasts. This impressive-looking car was one of many built by Alan Padgett, in a form described as a Sports Roadster Convertible. The MK VI saloon was purchased by A.R. (Rhys) Marks in 1974 and the usual chassis conversion work was carried out including shortening the chassis to an 8' 9\" wheelbase and lowering and moving the engine back. Drive is through a normal MK VI gearbox to 15\" Wolfrace alloy wheels, using Avon 205/70 VR15 tyres. The suspension of course was lowered and the springs stiffened. Shock absorbers, steering and many components are completely standard, but the 4.9 litre engine removed from an 'S1' saloon benefits from using three SUs and a carefully tuned six branch manifold finishing as a completely external exhaust system.  \nThe handsome aluminium body shaped on steel tubing is set off by the well-rounded tail, which is extended beyond the chassis to give an overall body length of 14' 0\". The extremely usable body design has the spare wheel carried above the petrol tank, leaving a small amount of luggage space behind the back of the fold forward front seats. The description claimed as a convertible means that fold up roof sticks carried in the tail can be erected to give a modicum of weather protection when covered by a rather flimsy hood. H.R Owen Limited were the first owners of this chassis and no doubt the change wrought by Rhys to give a superb l2Omph roadster would astound them. Rhys has loved and cared for this beautiful car over the years. It's loud engine has enjoyed many Bentley rallies and has created lasting fond memories. This true head turner now needs a loving new home.  "}
{"name": "2001 ROLLS-ROYCE SILVER SERAPH 4DR AUTO - £72,000 ", "transmission": " AUTOMATIC", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "2001 Rolls Royce Silver Seraph\n\nRegistration Number:  Y147CGC\n\nChassis Number: H05425\n\nJust 14,600 miles from new & simply pristine.  This car was pusrchase din 2020 by one of our collector clients who only buys immaculate low mile Rolls Royce & Bentley cars.  He then traded it to us against a 5000 mile Azure.  A major service was performed in 2020 & agina we have serviced in December of 2022 so it is bang up to date.\n\nUnveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1998, the Silver Seraph replaced the Silver Spur. All Seraphs were hand-built at the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, England, which stopped making Rolls-Royce models in 2002 but continued with Bentley. The car had a base price of £155,175 in the UK and was powered by a 5.4 litre, aluminium alloy, BMW V12 engine making it the first twelve-cylinder Rolls-Royce since the 1939 Phantom III.\n\nStandard electronics included digital engine management, adaptive ride control and anti-lock brakes and, aside from the radiator grille, badges and wheels, the Rolls-Royce was externally identical to the contemporary Bentley Arnage sharing both its platform and bodyshell. Inside, the Silver Seraph and the Bentley Arnage were similar but quite distinct from one another. In the Seraph, the gear selector was column-mounted and the gauges followed a traditional Rolls-Royce layout (for example, there was no tachometer). In both cars, the seats and dashboard were upholstered in Connolly leather with dashboard trim and folding picnic trays for rear passengers and glossy burr walnut veneer.\n\nThe previous owner has had it maintained and serviced by Bentley Knutsford, main agents, with the last service being just a2000 miles ago in July 2020. The super-low mileage is very well documented throughout the history file including old MoT test certificates and many servicing and maintenance receipts. It has been used sparingly, covering just 6,000 miles in the last 14 years. This magnificent example, shown in Silver Tempest paintwork with French navy coachlines and an Oatmeal Hide interior with French navy accents, has had a very pampered life and is consequently presented in remarkable condition, still including both Rolls-Royce umbrellas and navy lambswool over rugs.\n\nHaving been chosen by the former owner for its elegant specification, pristine condition and very low mileage, this must surely be one of the very best remaining examples of what is already a rare and very special car. This Silver Seraph represents everything that gave Rolls-Royce its worldwide reputation for refined luxury, elegance and sophistication.\n\nIn effect this is like a brand new Rolls Royce being delivered 22 years late & wants for nothing.  Be sure to see the the You Tube video prepared by Anthony James who sold it to our client in 2020."}

{"name": "1983 JAGUAR XJS V12 - £29,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "We are delighted to offer this true collectors piece onto the market. C493 NGK is a very rare Jaguar XJS V12 Cabriolet TWR. This low mileage example was registered new to TWR Jaguar Limited and owned by them for several months giving the car some real provenance. TWR carried out the first service at 1231 miles on the 2nd July 1986 and 37 years later the car has covered just 62,000 miles from new with documented service history and a file of MOT's dating back to when the car was just three years old.\nAdding further provenance to the car, in August 2016 Jaguar World Magazine published a five page feature on the car, a copy of which is with the car. The feature confirms TWR created just a handful of TWR Cabriolets and they report this could be the best. In 1984 TWR announced that it was going to offer aftermarket enhancements to the XJS and the range included a new GRP body kit, new front and rear bumpers, side fairness and rear spoiler. The design improved the cars drag by 12.7%, reduced front lift by 6% and rear lift by 88%. New 16 inch Speedline alloys where added and a new range of colours, including two tone scheme. Mechanical changes included specially developed Bilstein shockers, stiffer springs, revised rear radius arms and new brake discs. The V12 engine received an increased capacity intake manifold and stainless steel exhaust system which increased power by 10%. This 5.3 V12 example does feature most of the TWR modifications such as the lowered suspension, colour coded bumpers, side skirts, four spoke steering wheel, TWR induction trumpets and the Speedline wheels. This example also boasts quad headlights and concealed spotlamps.\n\nC493 NGK is incredible to drive with exceptional performance and handling and has been driven faultlessly to us from the Northallerton area. We sold the car to the most recent owner back in 2017 and since last seeing the car it has covered 5000 miles and has had new rear calipers, discs and pads, brake master cylinder and servo, expansion tank, bonnet stuts, a brake fluid sender unit and regular servicing. The car has been superbly maintained and this is evident when driving. The V12 engine is super smooth with excellent oil pressure, the automatic gearbox feels perfect and the car drives totally correct. Power, acceleration and performance is something special and with its cabriolet roof, is perfect for summer touring on the Continent with reliability and high performance in a classic shape. The XJS also presents in first class order with excellent paintwork and bodywork, and a lovely Grey leather upholstery. The Speedline alloys and Black Cabriolet targa top hood are also in very good order. This really is a true collectors piece and with low mileage XJS cars really pushing on in value, this quite unique car offers collectors and Jaguar enthusiasts something very special. The car comes with a comprehensive history to include all original manuals and booklets. Service stamps are present at 1231, 14544, 17250, 19973, 53200, 54902 and 56230 miles. The most recent owner has also had the car serviced at 58942, 59841 and 61301 miles. Invoices for non stamped maintenance is also with the car. MOT certificates record mileages at 13389, 13526, 17257, 20684, 22751, 28885, 33804, 38504, 42401, 46108, 46993, 48958, 49931, 50646, 51235, 52102, 52692, 53769, 53985, 54380, 54734, 55096, 56243, 56306, 57481, 58942, 59841 and 61301 miles."}

Including: £1500 spent on it last year getting it sorted for the MoT etc, including a new timing belt. Upgraded suspension (Weitec), so it's slightly lower than standard. Jetex stainless exhaust system. Clutch, lots of chassis restoration and welding over the years.

It's without a headlining, although these are about £150 to get an aftermarket one. It runs and drives great!! It's garaged, has a MoT until September 2023 so it could be enjoyed as is, or of course further restoration. I have lots of spare parts (including power steering pump, discs, pads, passenger door mirror and all the bits of interior trim I removed, although they are very brittle and break easily so are a bit cracked etc.) The original speedo was changed around 30k for some reason, so the actual millage just over 142k.

The car was formerly sold by us in 2021 and is now back on the market for the second time round. Prior to the previous sale, the car was subject to a complete engine rebuild by John Eales in Leicestershire. The 1997 TVR nicknamed \"Tess\" by its first owner, has only covered 700 miles since 2021 by the current owner and presents beautifully. The exterior of the car, finished in Aston Martin Solent Silver is in excellent condition. This is complimented by a navy blue mohair hood which works perfectly. The TVR sits on metallic grey spider alloy wheels, wrapped in Toyo Proxes tyres. The interior is finished in biscuit leather with a navy leather dashboard and door tops. The carpets are navy blue and were replaced recently. The wooden veneer dash panel presents nicely but may require some attention in certain areas. The interior overall is in good condition for the age of the vehicle and the sporty cockpit is a nice place to sit. The 5.0l V8’s performance was improved by TVR Power in 2004 with a Taraka No. 5 upgrade. The Taraka upgrade improved the power by 15% and was added to few Chimaeras, making this car quite rare and desirable. During its recent engine rebuild in 2021, the Taraka upgrade was preserved and the car was dyno tested at 290bhp at 5000 rpm. The Chimaera is accompanied by a comprehensive history file including the original order form, invoice, owners handbook, an invoice for the Taraka upgrade and lots more.

Having covered less than 2000 miles since restoration, this a truly remarkable van offered for sale. This 1978 RHD bus was completely nut and bolt restored in 2018 to a totally original condition by Volkswagen Specialists 181 Classic Motors of Nottinghamshire. Before it’s restoration the van was in very good shape and required very little panel replacement – one outer sill, the sliding door and both front outer arches, which were all replaced with original parts. With a full bare metal respray on the interior and exterior in the original colour of Neptune Blue, the van is better than it left the factory.  The 1600 twin-port engine was completely rebuilt with the addition of a new carb and some modern twists – an electronic ignition and alternator. In our opinion these modifications do not take away from the originality of the van but make it a more comfortable journey.The braking system was replaced for new, from lines all the way to the callipers. It sits on grey powder coated steel wheels wrapped in commercial tyres to keep its original look.  The latest owner of the van used it as a mobile flower shop, we have decided to keep the fittings and fixtures within the van, but all of these are reversible if required. The cabin area is virtually unused since its restoration and is a joy to sit in. The van will also come with a Vintage sun canopy and pole kit to enjoy the outdoors. The van will be sold with a full year’s MOT and ready to go for its new occupier. Get yourself a very pretty van, ready for the show season which is bound to raise some eyebrows."}

The first owner, an E-type enthusiast had the car from new until 1979. In 1979, John McAleese, renowned body shop and garage proprietor acquired this excellent example of the type. John was Jaguar Drivers’ Club Ayrshire Area Representative for many years and enjoyed attending many car shows and tours with the car. He used it extensively until 2016 when it was taken off the road to fit new sills, incorporate sill stiffening panels and a pristine refurbishment was undertaken to satisfy the perfectionist in him. This included every nut and bolt being removed, the vehicle taken back to the bare and built up from scratch with a full body refurbishment. In the interest of complete authenticity, the original colour combination of sable brown with cinnamon interior was retained. John was well qualified to undertake the refurbishment as he was proprietor for 50 years of a 12,500 sq ft automotive body shop specialising in predominantly Jaguars and BMWs. His workmanship was so sought after that his job list included many Jaguars from far and wide, many achieving Concourse d’Elegance standard. The immaculate condition of this vehicle bears testimony to the high quality of the work undertaken. Sadly, John is no longer with us and, reluctantly, it has been decided to part with the car from his personal collection to allow another enthusiast to have full enjoyment of this splendid performer.  The car comes with typical documentation, a Jaguar series III E-type repair operation manual, a fully illustrated Jaguar series III E-type parts catalogue. In all, this car drives like a dream and really has to be experienced to appreciate fully the purr of this engine."}

Total history dossier. New Michelins. 41k miles from new. Fettled by Lindsay Porter. When Citroen’s famous moke, the 2CV-based Mehari, ceased production in 1987, Citroen collaborated with Teilhol to build its successor: the TANGARA.\nSadly, Teilhol went bust after only 1,500 were built. So, the Tangara is now quite rare. But this one is not only rare, it’s unique! To try to enter the UK market, Teilhol built two RHD Tangaras before they went under and this is the only one to have survived.\nIt’s done a crazy 41,000, fully-documented miles from new and is now owned by motoring writer and 2CV guru Lindsay Porter. Health problems mean he now has to reduce his Citroen collection.\nLindsay has put together 80-odd photographs about the car on Flickr – paste into address bar: tiny.cc/dc26vz \nHere’s a summary of information on the little car. 2CV-based with GRP body. The fibreglass is remarkably good with virtually no deterioration. Factory-built in France to full UK, right-hand-drive specification. Use as pick-up, soft-top, buggy (with full roof removal) and folding or detachable hood. Fettled by Lindsay to bring it back to its fabulous, original condition. Total history, right from the day it first left the ferry in Dover. Huge history dossier, in its own, large, portfolio case. New Michelin tyres (150 miles) on refurbished wheels. Fully documented and only 41,000 miles from new. All factory options fitted, rare rear seats, tilting front seats and even sun visors. Virtually ALL spares still available! A very useable and unique piece of Anglo-French motoring history, a delight to drive. And for only half the price of a comparable Mehari.\n"}

{"name": "1965 VOLKSWAGEN CAMPERVAN 21 WINDOW SAMBA PORSCHE RESTO-MOD - £POA ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "- Porsche-powered VW Samba - 3.2L Flat Six from an 80's Porsche Carrera 5-Speed Porsche Gearbox - Built from the ground up to the owners specification by Creative Coachworks - 6 page feature in Ultra VW - A fantastic creation! We are very pleased to offer for sale this fantastic creation. It all started when a customer approached Creative Coachworks and requested a top-specification, Porsche-powered VW be built from the ground up. The brief of this project was to create a vehicle that could travel at speeds of around 100mph on the Autobahn and would have braking and handling to cope with that kind of power. Ideally it would be Porsche-powered, with a matching five-speed gearbox. Creative Coachworks began by sourcing a good, straight 21-window Samba, which was a Japanese import found at a vehicle import specialist in York in August 2007. Exact specification and requirements were then to be confirmed with the owner. References of the Carramba project assembled by the Bugbox and a Samba on the Gumball 3000 were made. This resulted in a detailed brief to construct a sleek, understated and capable Samba with the luxury trimmings of a real gran tourer. A mechanical overhaul was the first task to be tackled so a suitable engine and gearbox had to be sourced. Most of the running gear for this project was donated from a mid-eighties 3.2-litre Carrera. The Samba was then completely stripped out allowing measurements to be made for the fitting of the new engine, gearbox and trailing arms. Some metalwork had to be trimmed away including parts of the fuel tank shelf, engine bay side panels and centre section of the torsion housing. Torsion tubes were narrowed to get the wheels sitting centrally in the wheel tubs. The bus then gained a Porsche 915 five-speed gearbox, with coil-over units taking care of the spring and damping duties. With rear end fabrication largely complete, bodywork was the next priority. In 2008 the Samba was chemically stripped and electrophoretically painted by SPL in Dudley, to ensure it was totally clean prior to any bodywork. The dashboard was modified so VDO gauges could be fitted. An inspection hatch was then grafted in place to make engine access and maintenance easier, and a very tight-fitting and unobtrusive roll-cage was fabricated. Creative Coachworks meticulously finished the bodywork, before handing the Samba over to Webster and Lancaster for paintwork, as requested by the owner. Nissan Pearl White and Peugeot Mica Black were the colours of choice with most of the chrome being painted also for a more subtle look. After paintwork was completed the car was returned to Creative Coachworks. The new fuel tank, fuel injection pump, the dry-sump oil tank, the complete 3.2-litre engine and the overhauled 915 gearbox were then reinstated along with many other things such as; Webasto heater Audio install within interior trim LCD flatscreen Games console DVD Player An excellent job was done achieving the owners request of a luxurious yet subtle interior. No metal is left uncovered inside, the fitting of the sunroof is excellent and the quality of the seats and interior panels are pure quality. The finishing touches being added to complete the Samba were; Brand-new glass supplied by A.H.Schofield and tinted by SterlingWindows New seals Removable tow bar Genuine 16-inch 911 Fuch wheels Continental tyres Exhaust fabricated around a 911 header system After all these works were completed the Samba was then MOT'd and taken for a proper rolling-road tune-up and a re-map of the engine to make sure it ran perfectly. The team behind this project have created a masterpiece which has been enjoyed by the customer who envisioned it. We are certain that this Samba will bring many years of good service to its next custodian. Now available for viewing at the DD Classics Dealership in London, please call to book an appointment. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the above information but errors may occur. Please check with a salesperson."}

Mechanicals maintained by Andy Stockton Performance Autos and sympathetic restoration to the body by JV restorations - both local to us. MoT to Feb 24 (no advisories on last MoT). New tyres and brake master fitted in Feb 23. Drives brilliantly and sale is due to mobility issues. Comes with numerous spares, including headlights, rear lights, electric door mirrors, s/roof motors and switch, speedo cable, gear linkage, fan cowl and boot access panel covers. This really is a great car and we are reluctant to part with it but unfortunately my wife finds access and egress from the car very difficult, hence it has to make way for something a little easier for her to live with. We hope this car can go to someone who can take it to the next level. it is not perfect but it is one of the best examples around with only minor fettling required to take it to concours level."}

In 1958 ABV108A was built being the 376th Series 2 off the line. ABV108A has been part of our family collection since 2009. It was always superb mechanically but needed bodywork renovations. A total bottom to top overhaul was started in 2019 and was finished in 2022. The re-commissioning project was carried out by Fylde Land Rover Services, a restoration company that only rebuilds Series Land Rovers and has done since the early 1970s. Notably, the vehicle has been re-panelled using new Paintman Panels, new trim using Exmoor trim Elephant hide seats, new canvas being undercovers Sand canvas. Tyres renewed with new period 600x16 tyres. All steel work requiring repair carried out, the whole underside finally liberally coated inside and out with waxoyl. Finally, ABV108A was re-painted in Paintman Pastel Green with Limestone wheels. Fantastic combination. Out on the road the drive is incredible for a Series 2, there is no play in the drive chain. The engine and gearbox are exceptionally smooth retaining the beautiful condition they were in prior to the re-build. The steering and brakes are just amazing, I haven’t driven any Land Rover for years that has steering as positive. ABV108A has a current MoT to ensure total safety even though it is MoT exempt. So, in summary what we have here is a tax exempt, MoT exempt, cheap to insure vehicle, re-commissioned Land Rover with all it's original features that can stand the test of time, whilst being a pleasure to drive. Lastly, it’s an investment that to be enjoyed and maybe even passed down through the family with pride. "}

{"name": "1974 LANCIA FULVIA COUPE 3 MONTE CARLO (LHD) - £19,950 ", "transmission": " 5-SPEED MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The Lancia Fulvia was first shown at the 1963 Geneva Motor Show – the name following the Lancia tradition of referencing historic Roman roads (in this case the Via Fulvia, which runs from Tortona to Turin). \n\nThe Fulvia was a new front wheel drive design, with independent front suspension using wishbones and a single leaf spring, and a beam axle mounted on leaf springs with a Panhard rod at the rear. From inception, the car had disc brakes on all four wheels. The new model used a longitudinally mounted, narrow angle V4 engine, positioned in front of its transaxle. The engine had just 12° separation between the two banks of cylinders, permitting the use of a single a single cylinder head and was mounted at an angle of 45°. \n\nThe Fulvia was manufactured in three body styles – the Berlina, a 4-door saloon; a 2-door Coupé and the Sport, a Zagato-designed fastback coupé. The 2-door Coupé was introduced in 1965, using a shorter wheelbase than its Berlina parent. The model underwent a number of ‘Series’ developments over its life and production ran on until 1976.\n\nThe Coupé 3 Monte-Carlo was introduced in 1974, being a mildly revised version of the earlier Coupé 1.3 S Monte-Carlo. This was a special edition model, made to commemorate Lancia's victory with a 1.6 Fulvia HF in the 1972 Monte Carlo Rally. The car was supplied with flared wheel arches as on the 1.6 HF, no bumpers and painted to emulate the works rally cars with a matt black bonnet and boot lid, adorned with Monte Carlo Rally stickers. It came in four market-specific colours - red (Italy), blue (France), orange (Holland) and green (UK). Specific to the Coupé 3 were revised bucket seats with headrests and a matt black grill and headlight frame. Just 2529 units of the Fulvia 3 Monte-Carlo were built.\n\nLittle is known of this car’s early history – although it is assumed it was first sold in the Netherlands given its colour scheme – until it was imported into the UK in February 1985. In the mid ‘90s, substantial restoration works were carried out and the car passed through a few keepers until 2013, since which time it has been with one owner, with very little subsequent use – the vehicle being kept in storage. \n\nMechanically the same as the earlier 1.3S Coupé, the car used the 1.3 litre, narrow-angle V4 engine, developing a claimed 90 hp at 6200 rpm, with a top speed in excess of 100mph. As part of the restoration works completed in 1995, the engine was rebuilt and a new clutch fitted. The suspension and braking system were also refurbished. 6x14 Cromodora alloy wheels have been fitted with 175/70 tyres.\n\nWhilst no major works have since been undertaken, the car has clearly been cared for with other mechanical refreshment work carried out, evidenced by invoices on file. The alloy wheels have been refinished very recently. The car fires up willingly and runs nicely – changing up happily through the dog-leg 5-speed gearbox, with a very sporty exhaust note! \n\nThe mid ‘90s bodywork restoration including the fitment of a number of replacement panels – sills, part wings, floorpans and a doorskin. Although not specifically recorded by way of a work invoice, the striking paintwork in Giallo Corsa Olanda will have been refreshed at this time too. The bodywork remains in a generally very good condition with just a few small surface imperfections. Monte-Carlo specification foglamps are not fitted to the car, nor are the bonnet and boot lid ‘Monte Carlo Rally’ decals.\n\nThe interior of the car is complete and in good order but does show some signs of use. A leather-bound Ferrero steering wheel has been fitted and the original speedometer replaced with an mph unit. \n\nThis a rare, genuine Fulvia Coupe 3 Monte-Carlo. The car was inspected and verified as a genuine Monte-Carlo model by the Lancia Motor Club in 2006. In a striking colour and good condition, it drives very well and could readily be used on a regular basis.\n\nThe car is currently located in Dorset and viewing may be arranged by appointment."}

Utilising technologies\nfrom their 959-flagship model, the 964 was more powerful than Porsche’s first incarnation, the 356. A new\nengine, improved suspension and brakes, and a lightweight body resulted in impeccable steering and handling\nfor the time, traits that continue to distinguish Porsche as a marque that effortlessly merges road and race cars.\nThe Porsche 964 was 87% new and originally available as an all-wheel drive C4, superceding the popular Super\nCarrera (SC) and following the Carrera 3.2. Established as a new 911, the car helped Porsche recover after a\nglobal recession in the late 1980s.\n\nDesigned by Benjamin Dimson, the 964 drew on its racing heritage; it combined the 356’s fastback styling with the supercar characteristics of the 1980s Turbo Porsches but shared just 13% of its parts with its predecessors.\nTranslated as ‘race’ in Spanish, carrera was first used by Porsche in the mid-50s to denote the most high-\nperformance models with racing technology, following Hans Hermann’s memorable victory at the Mexicana\nCarrera Panamerica in 1954, utilising a quad-cam engine.\n\nThe Porsche 911 964 was considerably technologically advanced compared to previous models. Aside from the\nchassis redesign, ABS brakes, coil springs and power steering were introduced. The rear suspension used the\nprevious generation Turbo’s aluminium semi-trailing arm set-up, and a smaller-diameter anti-roll bar fitted.\nThe classic 911 shape was transformed; despite using the same boot lid, wings, doors, and roof, Dimson\ndesigned new moulded bumpers with smooth contours and driving lamps inside the bodyline. To improve\naerodynamics and engine cooling, the distinctive retractable spoiler was housed in the engine cover and\ndeployed at speed, maintaining the car’s fluid lines. Rain gutters were reduced in size, front and rear windows\nfinished flush to the bodywork and trim was unadorned.\n\nIn 1990, all pre-964 models were discontinued, and the two-wheel drive Carrera 2 introduced. Targa and\nCabriolet versions followed. There were few visible differences between the Porsche C4 and C2 but were reported by Porsche to have the same performance figures, with a top speed of 162mph and capable of 0-60mph in 5.7 seconds. Both C2 and C4\ngained power from the previous generation’s 3.2 litre engine, however it was designed to be quicker than its\npredecessor. Engine capacity increased to 3.6 litres, with new forged pistons and the compression ratio raised to\n11.8:1. As catalytic converters were becoming compulsory, the modified engine ‘M64’ was required to run with or\nwithout them. A revised Bosch Motronic ignition and injection system produced 250bhp and 228lb-ft torque.\nAlongside the state-of-the-art Tiptronic transmission available on the C2, the 3.2 Carrera’s standard five-speed\nmanual gearbox was developed, featuring stronger ratios to cope with the increased power and torque. The new\nC4 and C2 featured new brakes, although they were derived from the 928 S4.\n\nOur immaculate 1991 Porsche 964 C2 Coupe manual combines the functionally beautiful, classic ‘Butzi’ 911\ndesign with improved handling and steering. Painted in an eye-catching Guards Red, and paired with a\nsophisticated black leather interior, this 964 would make a dramatic addition to an enthusiast’s collection.\n\n \n\n5 Speed Manual\n\n34,000 Miles\n\nGuards Red Exterior\n\nBlack Leather Interior\n\nElectric Windows\n\nElectric Mirrors\n\nPart Electric Seats\n\nBlaupunkt Media Player\n\nSun Roof\n\nRear Wiper\n\n17'' Alloy Wheels\n\n1 Former Keeper Only"}

The result was an unchanged drag coefficient but greatly enhanced downforce allowing the car to perform better when pushed in the corners. The F430 also borrows some design features from other Ferrari legends. The tail lights are distinctly reminiscent of the Enzo, the oval air intakes in the front bumper are reminiscent of Ferrari racers from the 60s like the 156 “sharknose” F1 car and the 250 TR61 raced at Le Mans by Phil Hill, and the wing mirrors are evocative of those made famous by the Testarossa. Despite the design borrowing from the greats, the engine was actually the end of a 50-year development cycle of V8s. The completely new 4.3L engine used in the F430 debuted a novel architecture which maximized volumetric efficiency. It allowed the displacement to increase by 20% whilst only increasing the weight by 4kg and actually reducing the overall diameter which made packaging easier in part thanks to borrowed F1 technology. This puts the F430s top speed in excess of 196 mph and acceleration at 0 to 60 in 3.6 seconds, 0.6 seconds quicker than the 360. This isn’t the only part of borrowed F1 tech on the car. When designing the Spider, they borrowed F1 aerodynamic simulators to ensure minimal deviation from the aerodynamics of the standard car. Inside the car, Ferrari debuted yet another future stalwart: the Manettino steering wheel which allows drivers to select from five settings in turn modifying the vehicles ESC system.\n\nThis low miles, classically specced, generously optioned model is an excellent addition to any collection and will offer any driver a joyous driving experience whether on the road or track. Additionally, this F430 is fitted with a Novitec Rosso front-splitter/rims and Hamann spoiler/rear kit. "}

The 993 initially launched as a base Carrera; throughout its\nproduction it was available in fastback coupe, Targa, convertible, and speedster body styles. Designed by Harm\nLagaay and Tony Hatter, the fourth generation 911 featured significant improvements. As opposed to receiving a\nmere facelift like some of its predecessors, the new 911 shared just 20% of its parts with the 964, whilst\nmaintaining its classic profile. According to Hatter, “The Porsche board always had very firm ideas about its\nshape. It was claimed the 964 was 80 per cent new, but visually it looked barely 20 per cent new. We needed to\ndo something less conservative, but without being too radical.” Its smoothed front was influenced by the 959,\nplans for the 989 four-door sedan that never reached production, and 928. The wheel arches were accentuated\nto become more muscular, its retractable rear wing was enlarged, and its teardrop mirrors revised. The 993 was\nreferred to by Porsche as “a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.” The\n993 is another example of Porsche’s ethos, pairing tradition with innovation.\n\n\nA new multi-link rear suspension was derived from the 989. The light-alloy subframe with coil and wishbone\nsuspension corrected oversteer, and when combined with engine enhancements, vastly improved handling and\ndriving experience. The system was also used in the 993’s successor, where it provided the 996 with greater\nstability. It was the first 911 to receive a six-speed manual transmission as standard and the new automatic\nTiptronic S.\n\n\nOur immaculate 1996 Porsche 993 C2S Coupe debuted in the same year as the Carrera 4 S and Targa versions\nof the 993. Produced between 1996 and 1998, the Carrera S is one of the most valuable 993 variants. Our C2S\nperfectly showcases a stylish Ocean Blue body colour, complemented by a tasteful, classic grey leather interior.\nIt features the coveted Tiptronic transmission system with paddle shift and an electric rear spoiler first introduced\nin Benjamin Dimson’s 964. To aid aerodynamics and maintain the classic 911 silhouette, the spoiler raises when\ntravelling at over 50 mph (80 km/h), lowering at reduced speeds to integrate within the bodywork. With excellent\nhandling and modern conveniences such as part-electric seats, electric mirrors, and windows, alongside climate\ncontrol and Becker media player, the 993 coupe transcends mere efficiency to provide its owner with a thrilling\nride.

The slightly widened body and larger 18” wheels gave the 997s a more aggressive stance, and they all benefited from slightly increased power. Inside, the design was similarly reminiscent of the pre-996 generation design. The return to traditional styling makes the 997 generation feel like an homage to the iconic and prolific original 911s, yet the futuristic and modern technology and engineering make it a car firmly rooted in the present. Second Phase (post-2009) 997’s included facelift styling changes as well as direct injection, and PDK double clutch transmission which made them faster, lighter and therefore more fuel efficient than the earlier models. The 997 is truly the best of both worlds, a modern car in a subtly classic body, an eye on the past but a nod to the future. \n\nMidway through the model cycle Porsche introduced a mid-range 911 that filled the gap between the Carrera and the GT3. Although they went on to produce an all wheel drive version, the C2 GTS was the only rear wheel drive car fitted with what was traditionally the C4’s wider body style and track. Both the C2 and C4  featured an upgraded 3.8L engine with an output of 413 hp. Thanks to the backwards production process of the 997 generation (cabriolet before coupe), the GTS Cabriolet was one of the fastest convertibles in production when it was released, coming incredibly close to the C2 GTS Coupe’s dizzying performance statistics."}

Significant technical advances, including a new light-alloy subframe with a coil and wishbone suspension, an all new engine and newly standard 6 speed transmission, made significant progress in creating a more civilized car and a greatly improved driving experience. Designed by Tony Hatter, the 993 retained the classic 911 shape but featured updated exterior panels, significantly flared wheel arches, and a smoother front and rear bumper design. The aggressive stance of the wide-style body accommodated the new multi-link rear suspension which gave the car better stability. Newly improved handling made the car more planted and helped to reduce oversteer in cornering as well as improving ride quality and reducing interior noise. The acclaimed rear design sacrificed top speeds for better handling making it the perfect weekend partner to tackle the narrow, winding English country roads. Simply put, the new design and technical improvements meant the 993 generation Porsche hit the sweet spot between usability and fun.\n\nThe 993 turbo was introduced in 1995 and featured a new twin-turbocharged engine which brought the output up to 402 hp with the help of air-to- air intercoolers, electronic engine management, and redesigned cylinder heads. The 993 Turbo was the first to feature all wheel drive which was accommodated by wheel arches that were widened by approximately 6cm over the standard 993’s already enlarged arches. Most notably, the rear featured a fixed “whale tale” rear wing which housed the intercoolers and dramatically upped the 993 Turbo’s “cool” factor. The Turbo also featured larger brakes, new 18” alloy wheels, and was one of the first production cars in the world to feature the  OBDII diagnostics system which would later feature as standard on the base 993 models. Thanks to a host of updates and firsts, the Turbo is an exciting drive but the all wheel drive system means the car still feels in control.  Later production models featured a few key differences that improved upon the 95-96 years; stronger transmission input shafts were better able to handle the immense power in partnership with the AWD system. They also featured a modifiable ECU, motion sensors for the alarm, and “Turbo” emblazoned wheel caps. \n\nConsidered by many to be the last of the ‘classic’ 911s, this Turbo S had an original production run of 345, of which only 23 were RHD. The 993 Turbo S was the first 911 with permanent four-wheel drive but the last with an air-cooled engine so in a way, it marks a transition in Porsche’s line-up. The Turbo S was upgraded over the standard Turbo to include a body-kit, wing, and updated brakes - six-piston callipers. The suspension has been stiffened and lowered by 15mm, and the bigger turbos and new exhaust take the power up to 450hp.\n\nThis particular Turbo S  is finished in its original Speed Yellow, as it was delivered from the Porsche Factory, and has only done 66,000 miles. The bodywork is in pristine condition unblemished by scratches, major marks or dents and the coachwork remains without chips, cracks or any sort of damage. Many elements of the interior match the beautiful Speed Yellow coachwork. The black leather seats have matching speed yellow hard backs and seatbelts, and the instruments in the dash are also finished in speed yellow. All the leather and the fittings are in exceptional condition with no tears or holes, evidence of careful and considerate use by its owners. It also features litronic lights, heated seats, electric mirrors, a Porsche CD Radio head unit, an upgraded sound system, a self-dimming rearview mirror, a sunroof, yellow brake callipers, aerokit front splitter and rear spoiler, the carbon fibre reinforced suspension strut, 18” chrome Turbo S alloy wheels and a full service history with recent Official Porsche Major Service.\n\nOur Turbo S has recently undergone an extensive “4 corners” nut and bolt rebuild by Tony Walker who spent most of his career at the prodigious Porsche Centre in  Hatfield and is therefore presented like new. Every single milimitre of the car has been meticulously worked over and brought up to concours standard. The consumables have been replaced and four special order Turbo S shock absorbers were ordered from Germany alongside new brake discs and pads (front and rear), shims, and sensors. Most sections of the suspension have also been renewed, including the uprights, the bushes and any other related replaceable and worn parts. The car was then sent away to have the suspension set up and aligned so as to match all the new parts, thus  giving this Turbo S the best ride possible. We do not believe that anything else on the underside or the consumables warrant any replacement, in virtually all respects this vehicle is like new. There simply isn’t a better Turbo S on the market, and we aren’t the only ones who recognise its truly remarkable condition. This Turbo S has enjoyed widespread media coverage in numerous Porsche Publications, even making the cover of GT Purely Porsche in April 2005 and featuring in the April 2013 edition of Total 911 magazine. The vehicle has been singled out as an exceptional find as recently as May of 2020. The editor in chief of Total 911 took the car out for the day and his findings feature prominently in the June 2020 issue. This Turbo S has been a contender in several concours exhibitions. Most notably, it was awarded Best in Class by Bonhams at St. Mawes, and was presented with the 911 Best in Class by Derek Bell as part of the Porsche 70th Anniversary year of Salon Prive at Blenheim Palace. 1 of just 23 RHD cars, this provenance-rich, stunning example of the ultimate air-cooled, turbocharged 911 would be a collection-making car for any enthusiast.

The detail is very good with a very sharp, clean engine bay and the underside does not disappoint having been a car that has never suffered from major corrosion. The interior is remarkably original and in lovely condition and the boot compartment and spare wheel well are both excellent, this example does not disappoint.\n\nOn the road the Jaguar performs perfectly and starts superbly having been fitted with a manual choke system. With impressive performance from the 3.4 litre six cylinder engine, first class five speed gearbox and power brakes and steering, the XJ is effortless to drive with subline handling. The car is a true delight to drive offering comfort, luxury, a relaxed ride in a vehicle that was so advanced in its day. Whilst this is a low mileage car, it has been driven to many events such as Silverstone, and in 2019 was covering some miles over on the Continent in the Netherlands, completing around 650 faultless miles with the JDC. The Jaguar has recently been serviced and prepared (at a cost of over £1100) by a Jaguar specialists who commented how impressed he was with the condition and originality of the vehicle.\n\nThis is an exceptionally rare, largely original example that comes with impressive history file containing many receipts and invoices, old MOT certificates, spare keys and original handbook and sales pack."}
{"name": "1997 MAZDA MX5 - £17,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "We are delighted to offer this incredibly special car onto the market. This Mazda MX5 really does tick all of the boxes when it comes to spec, mileage, ownership, condition and provenance. Our car has covered just 16,000 miles from new and is a one lady owner car with all its original manuals, original bill of sale, service book, hard top, supplying dealership number plates and spare keys that still even retain the supplying dealership keyring. Further to this, it is a special edition Harvard, named after the famous US University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Only 500 of this collectible special edition were built, all produced between May and September 1997 and based on the larger engine 1.8 model, finished in Silver Stone Metallic with Burgundy leather. The Harvard model features 15 inch alloy wheels, chrome brace bar, leather interior, wood trim, Momo leather steering wheel, scuff plates and Harvard badging and floor mats.\nThis stunning example was sold new by Arundale Mazda in Middlesbrough, first registered in May 1997 and sold to a lady on Teesside. The original sales invoice from 1997 is with the car, confirming the purchase date as the 17th May 1997 and its clear from the history file this was the owners second car as an invoice for a new Mazda Tribute dated 2004 is also in the history file. The Mazda was first serviced at 7552 miles on the same day of its first MoT in 2000, and MOT records are with the car covering the last 23 years recording and warranting the mileage. The next service was stamped in the book at 11251 miles in 2003 and each year the car has been with local garages for its annual MOT and check over and service as required.\n\nWe can confirm the Mazda is superbly presented with an exceptional bodyshell and structurally first class underside. Due to the age of the paint and some minor blemishes associated with an original car, the Mazda has recently been subject of a complete outer re-spray at the cost of almost £6000. The result is a first class paint finish on an excellent bodyshell. The upholstery as expected from the ultra-low mileage is beautiful and original, as is the hood and the hard top excellent. The Mazda has arrived with current MoT, but will be supplied to its next owner with a fresh 12 months MoT, full service, function check and new set of tyres. This low mileage car has excellent running gear as expected from the mileage, and is a fabulous collectors piece with unrepeatable provenance."}

Jaguar only made 102 XJR 6 cars with a manual gearbox so finding a good one is almost impossible.  The 6 cylinder car is highly regarded and many people prefer it to the later V8 which initially had problems with Nikisil cylinder liners and timing gears.  By contrast the 6 cylinder engines are robust.\nExternally, the bodywork, underside, chrome and glass are all excellent and correct / original.  The sapphire blue paintwork is not perfect with the odd stone chip and very minor supermarket imperfection.  The overall appearance is stunning though.  The wheels are excellent and original but a bonus is a full-sized XJR alloy spare in the boot.  All the doors fit well and the panel gap is good and consistent.  There is a steel tilt and slide electric sunroof too.  I am not aware of any accident damage, repair work or paintwork having been done.\nInternally, the car is lovely too with an excellent headlining, all instruments work, seats very good with only minor cracking and wear, good dashboard etc.  Only the air conditioning does not blow cold and I have not investigated this so it might just need regassing.  The carpets and glass are all good and it is ready to be used.  Even the digital clock works.\nThe engine is smooth, strong and quiet, the clutch has plenty of bite and is progressive, as are the brakes.  Gearbox is excellent and there are no knocks or clonks from the suspension either.\nIn summary, this is a great and rare car.  I have taken care to look after it and improve it and the previous owners did the same so this is a good example.  I shall be sorry to see it go but need the space and the funds for a house building project.\n"}

Powered by the 3.5 litre supercharged V6 engine shared by the other Evora and Exige variants but having been re-worked and tuned by Swindon Race Engines. This process involves major engine strengthening, forged pistons, con rods, higher lift camshafts and a specially re-worked exhaust system making this a very lively engine producing an astonishing 438hp, making it the most powerful Lotus under production, with a standing start to 60mph in a, astonishing 4 seconds. The throttle response is immediate.\n\nCombine this with a kerb weight of just 1277kgs and…….well it goes without saying!\n\nAlthough having had the capacity to build more, just 20 GTE’s and 1 Race Car were built at Hethel, the majority with the IPS semi-auto box and LHD formation although a small number of RHD models and a small number in Manual Transmission were built too.\n\nThey were all sold before they were built and once Lotus reached the required figures for the GT3 regs production of this amazing car ceased.\n\nWell, nearly!\n\nMore parts were produced than were necessary to complete the requisite 20 cars. Due to its special relationship with Lotus Stratton Motor Company entered into the deal to take on the remaining stock of parts and bodies to be able to produce five more cars, all hand-built by Stratton Motor Company to a unique spec and labelled the ‘Lotus Stratton GT’ under the direction of it’s owner and racing enthusiast Roger Bennington.\n\nThese five cars have now completed the meticulous build and are ready to go to their new homes.\n\nEach is powered by the 438 bhp 3.5 litre V6 ‘Eaton’ supercharged charge cooled engine but are now supplied with the manual version of the gearbox that was found in the original GTE’s.\n\nEach has its own individual colour scheme and specification although nearly all are loaded with metres of weight-saving carbon fibre to squeeze just that little bit more in terms of performance whilst also adding to the kerb appeal.\n\nTruly individual cars, hand-built by Stratton’s team of experts these cars will never be repeated and even as new cars, surely, already have a place in British motoring history.\n\nDark Green Metallic with chestnut leather trimmed seats and Production car No: 1\n\nFinished in dark metallic green, black gloss wheels, 19 inch rear, 18 inch front with Michelin Pilot Sport tyres, carbon fibre airdam trim, inspection hatch, door mirrors, screen trim, A-pillar, roof, louvred tailgate cover, air intake ports, engine cover and rear valance and a complete carbon fibre interior to include sill covers, floor panels (Extending to rear) where not carpet and door cards.

This 1985 W460 G Wagen is a one owner from new car. No, really. it was a demonstrator for Woking Motors of Walton-on-Thames before being sold to the people who would have it until recently. It still wears the original dealer plates, and the keys even retain the ‘demonstrator’ tag. A 230GE, it’s fitted with a 2,299cc inline-four petrol engine. It has a manual four-speed transmission, too. It’s covered 119k over the course of its life and is completely, other than the obvious consumables, original. No gaudy ‘rims’, no stick-on chrome, no tacky AMG badges. This is pure.  The G-Wagon had been off the road for twenty years and due to this the engine was locked solid so it’s had a second engine installed along with many other items needed due to being redundant for so long, including a new fuel tank, exhaust parts, brake pads and discs, some window seals, new clutch, 4 new tyres and all fluids replaced and a full service. It’s not often you can find them as remarkably solid as this example. It’s never been welded, it has never had any paintwork well that’s a lie as we just had a little rust developing under the rear light cluster so we had this repaired recently along with the recommissioning, there is no evidence of accident damage. It is, in many respects, quite remarkable. Just a couple of things to note, the Radio doesn’t work and neither does the fan heater. It’s ready to enjoy and drives remarkably well, took me by surprise how well it drives. It isn’t a showroom queen so it does show some patina and a hole in the seat, at the end of it, you will have one of the most desirable cars on the planet. One there is always, always a hungry market for. "}

An aluminium bodied four seater, the newcomer employed a platform type chassis with independent suspension all round: wishbone and coil spring at the front and De Dion with Watts linkage at the rear.\n\nThe DBS V8 was originally available in the Spring of 1970 adding to the line up alongside the DB6 and DB6 Mk2. The car was always meant to house the Tadek Marek V8, however issues at the 1967 Le Mans race, where an early version was fitted in the Lola-Aston Martin T70 Mk3 set back the use of the 5 litre unit until 1970 and the previous 4.0l 6 cylinder was used in its place.\n\nThis particular DBS V8 was first registered in November 1972 and has had six previous owners from new, with the preceding owner selling the car after 19yrs of ownership due to advancing years and declining health. The registration was changed in 1986 from PLN192L to the private plate NAX38, included in the price of the sale.\n\nFinished in Pacific Blue with Fawn leather interior, this DBS features an excellent history featuring details of a full nut and bolt restoration that took place in 2010 as well as a £28,000.00 engine overhaul. The overhaul included an upgrade that bored the cylinders from 5.3litres to 5.6 litres giving an engine output of 342bhp and 399 lb/ft of torque.\n\nIn its stock form the 5.3 litre engine was capable of a 0-60mph of just 5.9 seconds and a top speed of 160mph. However, in its upgraded form these figures will doubtless have improved.\n\nOther noteworthy features include a re-covered dashboard, new windscreen, new door and window seals throughout, refurbished wheels, stainless steel bumpers, new Avon ACR3 tyres to original factory specs, refurbished seat belts, upgraded stereo, new headlights and stainless steel exhaust parts.\n\nA portfolio of photographs recording the complete restoration is available as is a new dynamometer printout of the engines performance.\n\n1 of only 402 DBS V8’s built"}

Gary Kohs at Marketing Corporation of America. Kohs did some initial sketches of the concept for presentation to Ford management and suggested Healey be contracted to accomplish the work. It was though that the Healey name was well known in the sports car world and would add emphasis to a show car. A standard 1978 Ford Fiesta (US specifaction) to Healey Automobile Consultants Limited, Warwick, England. Donald and Geoff Healey began work to increase the performance of the Fiesta. They attacked four main areas; the engine, the suspension, the aerodynamics and finally the ergonomics of the driving compartment. US specifications for the 1978 Fiesta required emission control equipment that severely limited performance and this was a quickly removed once the car arrived in England. The standard bhp was 66 bhp at 5,000 rpm, when finished the modifications 105 bhp at 6,200 rpm was achieved 63 percent increase in power. The suspension and brakes modified and uprated, a set of 13in x 6in Minilite wheels fitted. With the increased wheel diameter all four wheel arches were given a slight flair. The steering remain standard, but a smaller diameter , thicker-rimmed steering wheel was fitted.The most noticeable aerodynamic change was the full width front spoiler fitted. The driving compartment was greatly enhanced by the use of Wolfrace-brand seats, the seats provided excellent lateral stability when the car was driven through corners in a sporting manner. A full roll bar was also fitted. Additional instrumentation was provided on the consul-mounted panel. This panel held a voltmeter, clock and all important oil temperature gauge. The spare Minilite wheel and tyre were securely mounted in the area normally occupied by the rear seats in a standard Fiesta.The Healey Fiesta was painted Jaguar British Racing Green with Yellow pin-striping adding to the subtle colour scheme. A small plaque was added to the centre of the dashboard. The Healey Fiesta was first shown as part of the Ford Racing Display at the 1978 Indianapolis race and during the following year was shown at many shows and racing events throughout the US. Only one Healey Fiesta was built and on the firewall of the car bears serial number HF-001. Thanks to the Healey book for the information."}

{"name": "1989 ASTON MARTIN LAGONDA - £POA ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Aston Martin V8 Lagonda was a luxury four-door saloon built between 1976 and 1989. A total of 645 examples were produced at an average selling price of £150,000.The name was derived from the Lagonda marque that Aston Martin had purchased in 1947. Aston Martin was facing severe financial pressure in the mid-1970s and needed something to bring in some much-needed funds. Traditionally, Aston Martin had worked on 2+2 sports cars, but the Lagonda was a four-door saloon with a brand new V8 engine used in the two door Aston Martin V8.As soon as it was introduced, it drew in hundreds of deposits from potential customers and in so doing, helped Aston Martin's cash reserves.The car was designed by William Towns in an extreme interpretation of the classic 1970s 'folded paper' style. It was as unconventional a design then as it is now. Car enthusiasts are fiercely divided on the car's aesthetic value.Throughout the history of the marque, these handbuilt Lagonda's were amongst the most expensive saloons in the world.The Lagonda was the first production car in the world to use computer management and a digital instrument panel. The Lagonda combined striking styling with opulent, club-like leather interior, and then-state-of-the-art instrumentation. Coupled to a three-speed automatic transmission its quad-cam carburettor/fuel injection V8 provided powerful performance when required.This stunning Aston Martin V8 Lagonda Series IV was supplied to the original owner on 10th August 1989, he kept the car for some 27 years and supported by an outstanding service record. The car was sold to an avid collector who loved and cherished the Lagonda for 11 years. The current vendor, another fastidious collector, purchased the car on 11th November 2017. Whilst the car has done little work of late, it has been exceedingly well cared for and as such, presents in beautiful condition. Finished in Winchester Blue with Parchment interior piped in blue, this automatic Aston Martin V8 Lagonda is also supplied with some unique, custom made, matching suitcases. The original invoice is in the file together with correspondence between the factory and the first owner, there are also a large number of service invoices from the Newport Pagnell based manufacturer. Aesthetically a futuristic design, the interior is an area of beauty with deep comfortable seats, walnut in plentiful supply and a dashboard that, by any standards, was classed as state-of-the art. This desirable Series 4 Aston Martin V8 Lagonda beautiful example is UK registered and comes with a V5C registration document, the original service books and a history folder. To be expected of such a low mileage example, she drives with no known faults and is ready to enhance a private collection. One thing is for sure, driving this car will put a smile on your face and a wave from any passer by."}

It also had a new cam belt and water pump at this point. It Was not supplied with correct wheels and could not buy a good set at the time so purchased a new set of Mazda 15 inch alloys and Yokohama tyres, in my opinion a cosmetic and road holding update over the original.

The car was sold out by the end of the show and the first customers were being handed their cars by July 1986. 50 production coupe models were built in all, with the same wheelbase as the production V8, but with a shorter chassis length and running the X Pack Vantage engine, the car was a true sports coupe. This car was chassis number 20031 and was built and destine for Zubair Motors in Oman for their client who ordered the car finished in Gladiator Red with Tan trim. The car was used in Oman for a number of years and a few kms when it was involved in a front-end accident in 1988. (Photographs of the car are excisable). The car lay up in a garage for a while and was advertised in the same condition. Mr. Rene Bloom went to Oman to view the car in 1995 to see the extent of the damage. Photographs were faxed back to Aston Martin to prepare a rough estimate of the work. By September 1995 the car had been shipped back to Aston Martin where a full and detailed estimate was prepared. (Photographs of the work are excisable). By January 1996 work had commenced and Mr. Bloom decided to change the exterior colour to British Racing green, while the repair was undertaken. The car was completed by the end of 1996 and driven back to Holland where it was registered with Mr. Bloom. The car was then sold to the current owner in May 1997 with 7,800 kms on the clock. The car has been loved and cared for by the same owner since, using it for European tours and holidays. With only 56,000 kms on the clock the car sits and drives so well.

These were designated as the 2-door Saloon and Drophead Coupé, introduced in 1965 and 1966 respectively. Production remained in London at Mulliner Park Ward; the new name was applied in March 1971.\n\nA Bentley version of the Corniche was also produced. It became known as the Bentley Continental from 1984 to 1995.\n\nThe Corniche draws its name from the experimental 1939 Corniche prototype. The name originally comes from the French word corniche, a coastal road, especially along the face of a cliff, most notably the Grande Corniche along the French Riviera above the principality of Monaco.\n\nThe Corniche, available as coupé or convertible, used the standard Rolls-Royce V8 engine with an aluminium-silicon alloy block and aluminium cylinder heads with cast iron wet cylinder liners. Twin SU carburettors were initially fitted, but were replaced with a single Solex 4A1 four-barrel carburettor introduced in 1977.[7] De-smogged export models retained the twin SUs until 1980, when Bosch fuel injection was added.\n\nA three-speed automatic transmission (a Turbo Hydramatic 400 sourced from General Motors) was standard. A four-wheel independent suspension with coil springs was augmented with a hydraulic self-levelling system (using the same system as did Citroën, but without pneumatic springs, and with the hydraulic components built under licence by Rolls-Royce), at first on all four, but later on the rear wheels only. Four wheel disc brakes were specified, with ventilated discs added for 1972.\n\nThe Corniche was different from other Silver Shadows in that it had exclusive half wheel covers with stainless steel trim (for brake cooling), a 3-spoke steering wheel with a wood rim, and Rolls Royce's first standard tachometer.\n\nThe Corniche received a mild restyling in the spring of 1977. Difference included rack-and-pinion steering, alloy and rubber bumpers, aluminium radiator, oil cooler and a bi-level air conditioning system was added. Later changes included a modified rear independent suspension in March 1979. In March 1981, after the Silver Spirit had gone on sale, the Coupé version of the Corniche and its Bentley sister were discontinued. For 1985 there were also cosmetic and interior changes.\n\nThis stunning gentleman's grand tourer was first delivered to the USA market in left hand drive format, where it was enjoyed in the warm States. The car was returned to Europe where it has undergone a total strip down inspection by the most conscientious and skilled craftsman too determine the best options to make this car into one of the finest and good looking examples.

B535 LNU\nChassis no. 12472\nMileage: 42924\n*The fastest Aston Martin of its day\n*Manual transmission\n*Good history file\nWith the resurrection of the ‘Vantage’ name in 1977, Aston Martin enthusiasts everywhere breathed a sigh of relief; previously applied to high-power versions of the DB six-cylinder cars, it had been dormant since the V8’s arrival back in 1969. A heavier car than its six-cylinder predecessor, the V8 suffered as emissions legislation became ever more strangulating, leading to concern that Aston Martin’s traditional performance image might be lost. The arrival of the Vantage dispelled any such worries.\n\nPropelling Aston’s V8 back into the supercar league was a tuned version of the existing 5,340cc engine breathing through a quartet of 48mm Weber carburettors rather than the standard 42mm instruments. Valves and ports were enlarged and the camshafts changed, the end result being an estimated maximum output of around 375-380bhp – in Rolls-Royce fashion the factory chose not to disclose the actual figure, merely claiming that power was ‘adequate’.\n\nIn 1978 the V8 Vantage earned the title of ‘world’s fastest accelerating production car’ and throughout its life delivered outstanding performance by any standard, accelerating to 60mph in just 5.2 seconds on its way to a top speed of 175mph. With such high speeds attainable, aerodynamic refinements were called for. Thus the Vantage gained a deep front ‘chin’ spoiler, blanked off front grille, and a boot lid spoiler, the latter being bolted on to the earliest cars and later integrated into the bodywork. There were commensurate improvements to the suspension, brakes, and tyres.\n\nOffered here is an example of the (AMOC designated) ‘Series 2’ Vantage, which featured the extensive mechanical and bodywork revisions of the ‘Series 4’ (Oscar India) V8 saloon. ‘12472’ appears to have benefited from an extensive restoration at some point in its past, these works included renewing the sills and a full re-spray and has bills on file for other work carried out by marque specialists Oselli. The history file is substantial, containing numerous bills from Aston Martin, a quantity of expired tax disks and MoTs; a CD-ROM of photographs; and old/current V5C Registration Certificates.

{"name": "2000 ASTON MARTIN V600 LE MANS - £POA ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 21473 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "Aston Martin Vantage V600 Le Mans Coupe\nAfter almost 20 years in production, Aston Martin’s V8 had been updated for the 1990s as the Virage. A consummate fast tourer, the Virage left room at the top of the range for an out-and-out sports car, hence the Vantage. Although the two models appear superficially similar, few panels are shared, while beneath the skin the Vantage chassis boasts the kind of extensive re-engineering required to cope with the massive increase in performance. The latter comes courtesy of a blown version of Aston’s 5,340cc V8 – twin mechanically driven Eaton superchargers being preferred to turbo-charging on the grounds of superior throttle response. Quite apart from its stupendous maximum output of 550bhp, remarkable enough in itself, the engine is monstrously torquey, producing 550lb/ft at 4,000rpm, a figure that made even the mighty the Chrysler Viper V10’s 450lb/ft seem puny by way of comparison. And for those who found 550bhp insufficient, there was the Works Service-developed ‘V600’ enhancement that brought with it an additional 50 horsepower together with upgrades to the wheels, suspension, and brakes. Announced at the British Motor Show at the NEC, Birmingham in 1998, the V600 package added £43,000 to the price of the standard Vantage.\n\nIn March 1999, Aston Martin announced that 40 special versions of the Vantage – the Vantage Le Mans – would be built to celebrate the factory’s famous victory at the Le Mans 24-Hour Race in 1959 when Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby took the chequered flag first in ‘DBR1/2’.\n\nThe basis of what was at that time the fastest Aston Martin ever was the standard Vantage, and the Le Mans version could be ordered with either the stock 550bhp or enhanced 600bhp engines. Although at a glance outwardly similar to the latter, the Le Mans could be distinguished by its front wing side vents – recalling those of the DBR1 racer – ducted bonnet, ‘nostril’ front grille and improved high-downforce air dam, while at the rear the spoiler was revised to incorporate the high-intensity and reversing lights. The Le Mans received unique five-spoke magnesium alloy wheels while beneath the skin its chassis boasted the kind of extensive upgrading, in the form of the ‘Driving Dynamics’ package, required to cope with the massive increase in performance that the Vantage gained over its Virage progenitor.\n\nOn the road, its potential performance was equally staggering: 0-100km/h (62mph) being achievable in 3.9 seconds while a top speed in excess of 320km/h (200mph) was possible. The Le Mans interior too was specially reconfigured in the sporting idiom, boasting perforated competition-style pedals, an oversize tachometer, aluminium gear lever knob, ‘button’ starter while the Wilton carpeting featured embossed ‘Aston Martin’ emblems.\n\nFinished in Aston Martin Racing Green with Charcoal and Alcantara hide interior\n\nLimited edition of only 40 cars\n\nThis particular Le Mans Edition is number 12\n\nOutstanding condition in every respect\n\nBona Fide collectors car\n\nFor further details please contact Roger or Kevin on 01508 530491\n\nStratton Motor Company serving you since 1972."}

Based on the Evora floorplan but with an extra track width of 110mm, the car was designed to have a lower centre of gravity, to be lighter and faster. Powered by the 3. 5 litre supercharged V6 engine shared by the other Evora and Exige variants but having been re-worked and tuned by Swindon Race Engines. This process involves major engine strengthening, forged pistons, con rods, higher lift camshafts and a specially re-worked exhaust system making this a very lively engine producing an astonishing 438hp, making it the most powerful Lotus under production, with a standing start to 60mph in a, astonishing 4 seconds. The throttle response is immediate. Combine this with a kerb weight of just 1277kgs and……. well, it goes without saying!\n\nAlthough having had the capacity to build more, just 20 GTE’s and 1 Race Car were built at Hethel, the majority with the IPS semi-auto box and LHD formation although a small number of RHD models and a small number in Manual Transmission were built too. They were all sold before they were built and once Lotus reached the required figures for the GT3 regs production of this amazing car ceased.\n\nWell, nearly!\n\nMore parts were produced than were necessary to complete the requisite 20 cars. Due to its special relationship with Lotus, Stratton Motor Company entered into the deal to take on the remaining stock of parts and bodies to be able to produce ten more cars, all hand-built by Stratton Motor Company to a unique spec and labelled the ‘Lotus Stratton GT’ under the direction of its owner and racing enthusiast Roger Bennington. These ten cars have now completed the meticulous build, seven having already been sold, so just the last three remaining.\n\nEach is powered by the same 438 bhp 3. 5 litre V6 ‘Eaton’ supercharged charge cooled engine but are now supplied with the manual version of the gearbox that was found in the original IPS GTE’s. Each has it’s own individual colour scheme and specification although nearly all are loaded with metres of weight-saving carbon fibre to squeeze just that little bit more in terms of performance whilst also adding to the kerb appeal. Truly individual cars, hand-built by Stratton’s team of experts these cars will never be repeated and even as new cars, surely, already have a place in British motoring history.\n\nThe individual specs are as follows: Grey (with Shelby stripe) Production No:2 Finished in a matt grey with a ‘Shelby type stripe, black gloss wheels, 19 inch rear, 18 inch front with Pirelli P Zero ZR tyres, carbon fibre front splitter and airdam trim, inspection hatch, door mirrors, screen trim, A-pillar, roof, louvred tailgate cover, air intake ports, engine cover and rear valance and a complete carbon fibre interior to include sill covers, floor panels (Extending to rear) and door cards.

Since the Aston Martin Vantage, on which it is based, is already one of the fastest and most desirable supercars in the world, Zagato’s prospects of attaining the required levels of speed and desirability look distinctly good’.\n\nWhilst the remarks concerning the speed may not be quite so true in this generation, the Zagato is probably more desirable now than the observations of the Motor’s journalist had quoted at that time.\n\nWith the introduction of the Vantage Zagato in 1986 Aston Martin renewed it’s association with one of Italy’s most illustrious carrozzeria, Zagato having been responsible for that most celebrated and desirable of all post-war Aston Martin’s, the DB4GT.\n\nThe Vantage Zagato was produced in very small numbers, just 52 coupes and a small number of convertibles.\n\nPart of Zagato’s brief had been to shred some of the standard Vantage’s not inconsiderable weight, and this was achieved by shortening the car by over 17cm with the redesigned super structure, the body and then using composite materials reducing the overall weight by some 10%.\n\nPowered by the  Aston Martin 5.3litre Four Cam V8 ‘X’ pack engine producing some 432bhp at 6200rpm and fed by a quartet of Weber carburettors requiring the installation of the ‘power bulge’ in the bonnet, one of the defining features of the  car’s design the car has incredible pace and an estimated top speed of 186mph.\n\nThis particular car, production No: 17, is finished in Javelin grey with black leather interior and has covered just 12150 miles from new and is in first class condition having been maintained with no expense spared.\n\nOriginally supplied by Aston Martin Lagonda (Newport Pagnell) this car has a full Aston Martin history and has been serviced by Stratton Motor Company since 2001 having been serviced by the same engineer, the suspension having been upgraded to achieve one of the best handling Vantage Zagato’s made.\n\nAt the time of advertising, this is believed to be only one of a few cars of it’s kind to be advertised in the UK, a genuine piece of motoring history and surely one for the purist’s collection.\n\nPlease contact either Kevin or Roger on 01508 530491 for further details."}

A total of 645 were produced.\n\nThe name was derived from the Lagonda marque that Aston Martin had purchased in 1947. There are two distinct generations, the original, the short lived 1974 design based on a lengthened Aston Martin V8, and the entirely redesigned, wedge-shaped Series 2 model introduced in 1976 along with subsequent evolutions.\n\nAfter the production of seven Series 1 cars, the Lagonda was designed from the ground up in 1976 by William Towns as an extreme interpretation of the classic 1970s “folded paper” style.\n\nIt was an unconventional design practice for Aston Martin and still is. Together with famous contemporaries like the Lamborghini Countach, Lotus Esprit, and the DMC DeLorean, the Lagonda is frequently named among the most striking wedge-shaped designs of all.\n\nCar enthusiasts are fiercely divided on the car’s aesthetic value.

The latter comes courtesy of a blown version of Aston’s 5,340cc V8, twin mechanically driven Eaton superchargers being preferred to turbo-charging on the grounds of superior throttle response. Quite apart from its stupendous maximum output, remarkable enough in itself, the engine is monstrously torquey, producing 550lb/ft at 4,000rpm, a figure that made even the mighty the Chrysler Viper V10’s 450lb/ft seem puny by way of comparison.\n\nOn test with Autocar magazine, a development Vantage raced to 60mph with a Ferrari 512TR-destroying 4.6 seconds, reaching the ‘ton’ just 5.5 seconds later. The standing kilometre was achieved in 23.1 seconds with the speedometer registering close to 150mph, and although a true top speed figure proved unobtainable, the car was reported as having already recorded 191mph while on test in France.\n\nThis superb Aston Martin Vantage features walnut veneer coloured instrument faces, AM-logo’d carpets, padded headrests, driver’s air bag, electrically operated and heated seats and is the ultimate in classic luxury motoring.\n\nThis unique car has covered a mere circa 31690 miles from new and is the rare and sought after manual gearbox version.\n\nFinished in dark Blue with light stone leather interior, this superb example of what was, in its day, the ultimate Aston Martin supercar.\n\nPlease call Kevin or Roger on 01508 530491 for further details."}

Beautiful hand-built craftsmanship abounds in this most aristocratic of convertibles” declared Fast Car magazine.\n\nThe production Virage Volante debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1991, a prototype having been displayed at Birmingham’s NEC the previous October. Weighing in at over 2 tons, the open Volante was even heavier than the closed coupe, itself no lightweight, this increase in weight being accounted for by considerable body strengthening to compensate for the absent roof, plus extra complication of the power operated hood. Electrically powered, the latter was beautifully made and incorporated a glass rear window, complete with heated de-misting elements. Mechanically the Volante remained much the same as it’s closed cousin, though with slightly lower final drive gearing to aid acceleration through the gears. Top speed was slightly reduced , but still to 150mph. Automatic transmission was standard on the Volante, the original three-speeder being superseded in 1993 by a new four speed dual-mode (Normal/sport) unit. The five speed manual continued to be available as an option.\n\nOne of the finest British performance sports cars of it’s time, the Virage Volante is rapidly becoming  a prized collector’s car.\n\nThis particular example has had only four previous owners and has belonged to the current vendor since 2005.\n\nStratton Motor Company have maintained this car since 2005, though no major restoration work has been required.\n\nThe car currently displays 65000 miles and is on good condition throughout.\n\nPlease call Kevin or Roger on 01508 530491 for further details."}

Based on the Evora floorplan but with an extra track width of 110mm, the car was designed to have a lower centre of gravity, to be lighter and faster. Powered by the 3. 5 litre supercharged V6 engine shared by the other Evora and Exige variants but having been re-worked and tuned by Swindon Race Engines. This process involves major engine strengthening, forged pistons, con rods, higher lift camshafts and a specially re-worked exhaust system making this a very lively engine producing an astonishing 438hp, making it the most powerful Lotus under production, with a standing start to 60mph in a, astonishing 4 seconds. The throttle response is immediate. Combine this with a kerb weight of just 1277kgs and……. well, it goes without saying!\n\nAlthough having had the capacity to build more, just 20 GTE’s and 1 Race Car were built at Hethel, the majority with the IPS semi-auto box and LHD formation although a small number of RHD models and a small number in Manual Transmission were built too. They were all sold before they were built and once Lotus reached the required figures for the GT3 regs production of this amazing car ceased.\n\nWell, nearly!\n\nMore parts were produced than were necessary to complete the requisite 20 cars. Due to its special relationship with Lotus, Stratton Motor Company entered into the deal to take on the remaining stock of parts and bodies to be able to produce ten more cars, all hand-built by Stratton Motor Company to a unique spec and labelled the ‘Lotus Stratton GT’ under the direction of its owner and racing enthusiast Roger Bennington. These ten cars have now completed the meticulous build, seven having already been sold, so just the last three remaining.\n\nEach is powered by the same 438 bhp 3. 5 litre V6 ‘Eaton’ supercharged charge cooled engine but are now supplied with the manual version of the gearbox that was found in the original IPS GTE’s. Each has it’s own individual colour scheme and specification although nearly all are loaded with metres of weight-saving carbon fibre to squeeze just that little bit more in terms of performance whilst also adding to the kerb appeal.

Whatever the undisclosed output of the Aston V8, it is enough to rocket this heavy car to 60mph from rest in exactly six seconds and to 100mph in only 14. 7 seconds. Much more than this, we were able to reach 138 mph from rest in a mile and on the Continent record a mean maximum speed of 161. 5 mph.’ – Autocar, 8 July 1971.\n\nWith the resurrection of the ‘Vantage’ name in 1977, Aston Martin enthusiasts everywhere breathed a sigh of relief; previously applied to high-power versions of the DB six-cylinder cars, it had been dormant since the V8’s arrival back in 1969. A heavier car than its six-cylinder predecessor, the V8 had suffered as emissions legislation became ever more strangulating, leading to concern that Aston Martin’s traditional performance image might be lost. The arrival of the Vantage dispelled any such worries.\n\nPropelling Aston’s V8 back into the supercar league was a tuned version of the existing 5, 340cc engine breathing through a quartet of 48mm Weber carburettors rather than the standard 42mm units. Valves and ports were enlarged and the camshafts changed, the end result being an estimated maximum output of around 375bhp. Chassis changes were minimal apart from the adoption of bigger ventilated discs all round and low-profile Pirelli tyres. The Vantage was, nevertheless, readily distinguishable from the standard product by virtue of its blocked-off bonnet scoop, blanked air intake, front chin spoiler, and lip on the boot lid.\n\nProduced to satisfy demands from the USA, the Volante debuted in 1978 but it was not until 1986 that it became available to Vantage specification, which by this time meant around 400bhp. Along with the Vantage engine and bonnet came flared wheel arches, a boot spoiler (a feature the Volante had previously lacked) and an extended front spoiler, while glassfibre extensions replaced the model’s hitherto characteristic chromed sill covers. The result was a muscular, aggressive-looking car that could justifiably claim to be the world’s fastest convertible, all the more so when it came with the optional 432bhp X-Pack engine like this example. A total of 166 Vantage Volantes had been completed by the end of production in December 1989.\n\nRecognised initially for their outstanding performance credentials, the X-Packs are now true collector’s items as enthusiasts acknowledge their blend of quality and rarity.\n\nThis beautiful Volante version was supplied virtually as new by Stratton Motor Company in 1987 and has been in the family and maintained by us from that date.\n\nFinished in Chichester blue with a cream leather hide interior, dark blue piping and trim it also comes with its original hood.\n\nThis car was a special build for the original customer ‘J Hockney Esq’ and still has the plate denoting it’s individuality on the centre console.\n\nIt is in a truly outstanding condition, original paintwork and interior trim, meticulously maintained and cherished, first registered in May 1987.\n\nPlease contact Kevin or Roger on 01508 530491 for further details."}

{"name": "1975 BRICKLIN SV-1 - £POA ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 34700 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The Bricklin SV-1 was manufactured from 1974 until early 1976 for the U.S market, the car was the creation of Malcolm Bricklin, who had previously founded Subaru of America although the actual design was the work of Herb Grasse, the designer of TV's original Batmobile. The model name (SV1) stood for \"Safety Vehicle One\". Assembly took place in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada.\nThe original concept was a safe economical sports car, with an integrated roll cage, 5mph bumpers and side beams. The body was colour impregnated acrylic resin bonded to fibreglass in five \"safety\" colours (White, Green, Orange and Suntan) which had the potential to reduce cost , as it eliminated the need for the factory to paint the cars in a separate step. Cigarette lighters or ashtrays were not provided as non-smoker Bricklin believed it was unsafe to smoke while driving.\nThe SV-1 was the only production vehicle in automotive history to have power gull-wing doors, opening band closing at the touch of a button. An innovative desgin it may have been, but for his choice of power unit Malcolm Bricklin relied on the tried and tested good old US V8. Cars built in 1975 and 1976 were fitted with the 351ci (5,752 cc) Ford Windsor V8 mated to the 3-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission although 1974 cars were optioned with a 4-speed manual gearbox.Performance figures rated favourably against the contemporary Corvette, which most magazines road-test used as a point of comparison.\n\nDue to Brinklin's lack of experience in the industry, coupled with funding problems, the Bricklin factory was not able to produce vehicles fast enough to make a profit. As a result, only 2,897 cars were built before the company went into receivership, owing the New Brunswick government $23 million. An estimate 1,700 Bricklins are thought to be somewhere in the world today, not a bad survival rate. Despite the Bricklin's troubled story, the marque has a dedicated and loyal following, and several parts suppliers offer door conversion kits and body parts. This particular car is finished in Safety White and powered by the 5.7-litre Winsor V8 with an automatic transmission. This is thought to be one of a couple of driving cars in the UK today and is still in good working order. the car was imported from California in 2018and the mileage is today 34995 and during the ownership the suspension bushes, fuel lines and brakes have been changed or overhauled. the carburettor has been fully re-built. The gull-wing doors have been re-built and in good working order. This SV-1 has enjoyed appearances recently at various car shows and indeed graced the concours lawn at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2021. Ten years ahead of his erstwhile colleague, John DeLorean, Malcolm Bricklin's gull-winged, safety conscious V8 sports car was an interesting chapter in the tale of the automobile and is to be respected for putting safety first at a time when that was simply not in fashion."}

The Volante's consistently fetch higher prices than their roofed colleagues.As the name suggests, the V8 Zagato was based on the Aston Martin V8 but with a body by the famed coach-builder Zagato.The design was an angular modern interpretation of the Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato of the 1960s.The squared off grille was especially controversial. The Zagato was powered by a 430 bhp (321 kW; 436 PS) V8 engine with twin choke Weber carburettors.The all alloy car could hit 300 km/h (186 mph).It was a luxurious car with a price tag of USD $156,600 at the time, but with the high rarity, and being released at the supercar price boom of 1987 to 1990, and by the end of the decade, the car was changing hands for £450,000.The later Volante sold for $171,000.This very fine and very original examples is possibly one of the best examples with documented history from new and with only two previous owners and 7,850 kms from new. The car was sold originally to Helle Johansson in Monte Carlo though the French Aston Martin dealer in Monaco British Motors on 02 December 1987. The car was then sold on to Wendels the Swedish Aston Martin Dealer and was kept as Mr Wendels own personal car. In 2009 the car was consigned through Classicmobilia to be sold and was shipped to the UK where it was registered and sold to Mr Keith Piper the ex Aston Martin Owners Club Chairman. The car has been used sparingly and very well looked after with a fully serviced. This car is one of the best driving Aston Martin V8 Vantage Zagato's and never been messed around with, totally standard and totally unique as to the originality, having it full tools, keys and books, just so rare to find in this wonderful condition."}

With nine un-sold chassis and Aston Martin needing a car to display for the 1994 British International Motor Show at the NEC in Birmingham, the Aston Martin Limited Edition was produced. The car was very similar to the Virage, with the distinctive V front grill; five spoke alloy wheels, restyled front spoiler with fog lamps and more horsepower, by 24 bhp. All nine cars were to be Deep Jewel Green Metallic, with Special Tan leather, Beige carpets, Burr Elm wood veneers and a brass plaque on the dash, with owner and Chassis Number. All cars were four speed automatic and the addition of a drivers air bag with the first to be introduced side air bags was included. The chassis run was 50411 to 50419 and this being 50417 specially ordered from the Motor Show stand by Mr. Lennox Lewis WBC Heavyweight World Champion, requesting a number of other options to be included on his order. The first being extra leg room and extra sound system. Mr. Lewis owned the car until 2005 when it was sold through Bonhams Auction in Newport Pagnell, with 33,000 miles and entered without his knowledge, but accepted the sale. The car was regularly serviced at Aston Martin Works service while in his ownership. The car was then sold to an Aston Martin collector where it sat in a large collection, only covering 2,000 miles until 2012 when it was sold to Noble House in Holland. The car was then sold to the current owner in 2015, who again has only covered a few hundred miles. With only just over 33,500 miles the car has been fully checked over and is in very good condition, some minor trim wear, but all from the large frame of the WBC Heavyweight Boxing Champion.

{"name": "1999 ASTON MARTIN VANTAGE PROJECT - £POA ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 7 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "The Aston Martin Project Vantage Design Concept for a \"Supercar\" of the future Aston Martin Project Vantage In January 1998 Aston Martin released to the world that the Design Concept for a supercar of the future was being launched. The press release continued to read: A prototype design concept for a totally new advanced technology 200 mph plus Aston Martin Supercar of the future is to be previewed at the 1998 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Project Vantage is the direct result of close and continuing cooperation between engineers and designers at Aston Martin, Ford Advanced Vehicle Technology, Borg Warner, Magnetti Marelli, AP Racing, ITT, TRW and other Aston Martin suppliers. It draws heavily on the advanced research programs currently being conducted by Ford AVT and the wealth of experience which this group has gained from participation in Formula 1 Grand prix racing and other areas of international motor sport. Although we have no plans for the production of this technologically advanced Grand Touring cr it has been designed and planned so that it could be constructed individually employing the traditional skills and craftsmanship for which Aston Martin is world famous said Bob Dover, Chairman and Chief Exective of Aston Martin. We believe that the Vantage Project reflects all essential elements of power, performance and driver involvement in a manner which is true to the traditions of Aston Martin. With its body and chassis construction entirely from aluminum and carbon fiber Project Vantage provides all the engineering efficiencies, structural integrity, torsion rigidity and occupant protection of a modern Formula 1 car. In addition a central venture incorporated in the underbody creates positive down force as an aid to its directional stability. Advanced electronic control systems for engine management and the transmission permit instantaneous gear changes through a system of Formula 1 style paddles, which can be operatedThe driver and passenger seats are equipped with four point safety harnesses and there is matching tailored luggage fitted in the boot and the interior lockers. Power is provided by a prototype 6.0 litre aluminum alloy V12 48 valve engine which is one of the units currently being evaluated by Aston Martin, Ford AVT and Cosworth Engineering of Northampton in a wide ranging study designed to establish and identify Aston Martins potential engine requirements for the future. With base design by Ford AVT this advanced V12 unit is capable of being developed to provide the required levels of performance for the Vantage Project while meeting or exceeding the worlds strictest emission standards. For example, its high efficiency exhaust system has been designed to incorporate a 9.0 litre catalyst. Initial performance predictions indicate that this 200 mph high efficiency Aston Martin Project could accelerate from rest to 60 mph in just 4.0 seconds, reach more then 140 mph at the end of a standing quarter mile yet still return a fuel economy in excess of 20 miles to the US gallon. Benefitting from Ford AVTs direct involvement with the Stewart Ford Formula 1 Grand Prix team and Bridgestone Tyre Project Vantage employs unequal length wishbones in its front suspension controlled by horizontally located pushrod operated spring and damper units together with an active control front and rear anti-roil bar system. At the rear the independent suspension is by equal length wishbones. The AP Racing anti-lock brake system features ventilated and drilled 15ins diameter disc on the front wheels and 14ins diameter at the rear. The six pot aluminum ally calipers are equipped with titanium bridge bolts and fittings. By combining aluminum honeycomb with carbon fibre Aston Martin body designers have created a structure, which takes full advantage of modern Formula 1 technology including the generation of positive down force. The passenger compartment is including the generation of positive down force."}

The targa top is present and in excellent condition, as is the folding hood. \n\nThe Griffith is a high-power, well-balanced car with huge performance on offer coupled with an un-mistakable exhaust note. This fine example has that sparkling performance and is in excellent condition with good, documented history from 2004 on file, indicating the efforts spent in keeping the car as original as possible and in tip-top condition. \n\nThe car is currently Guernsey registered and we would assist/advise with shipping and importing processes if required.

{"name": "1975 TRIUMPH TR6 - £22,950 ", "transmission": " 4-SPEED MANUAL + OVERDRIVE", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "Introduced in January 1969, the Triumph TR6 was essentially a facelift version of the earlier TR5 model completed by German coachbuilder Karmann, which added a squared-off nose and tail, giving the car a more contemporary appearance. Underneath the revised body it was much the same as the TR5 with a separate chassis and a front-mounted 2 1/2 litre straight-six powering the rear wheels through a four-speed gearbox. Independent rear suspension and rack and pinion steering were inherited from previous models, although a front anti-roll bar was added. The UK market TR6 was fitted with Lucas fuel injection and in 1972 a revised camshaft profile and reduced compression ratio (from 8.5:1 to 7.75:1) were introduced that reduced the claimed power output slightly to 125bhp. The following year a new front airdam was fitted, headrests were made standard and the switchgear and instrumentation was revised. For 1974, overdrive became a standard fitment. \n\nThis car was first registered in the UK in 1975 and underwent quite extensive restoration/renovation work between 2004 and 2006 before being imported to Jersey in 2009. The Carmine Red paintwork is in fine condition as is the car's brightwork and the Minilite wheels fitted. The chassis looks equally solid, having last been Waxoyled in 2015. A roll cage has been installed and new mohair hood was fitted in 2014. The interior is in very good order. The wooden dash is unmarked and all instruments are present and correct. Uprated, black leather, Mazda MX5 seats have been fitted. The carpets, door cards and tonneau cover are all in fine fettle. The car drives very well, the current enthusiastic owner having carried out many useful, yet sympathetic upgrades and additions - electronic ignition; sports exhaust manifold & back box; electric cooling fan; aluminium fuel tank and Revington TR Logic Switch Overdrive - whilst keeping the vehicle well maintained and in good order. The running gear benefits from recent suspension work with uprated Koni shock absorbers fitted front and rear. New rear tyres were fitted in 2020. \n\nThis is a fine example of a UK-specification TR6 which has benefitted from many useful owner-installed upgrades and additions, whilst having been correctly and conscientiously maintained over the last decade. There is an extensive history file detailing recent expenditure; a photographic record of the restoration works carried out in 2004-6 and MOT history from 1988 until import to Jersey in 2009. Whilst the car is Jersey registered, it is currently located in Dorset and viewing can be arranged by appointment. We can assist / advise with the importation process if required, but any import duties (currently 5% into the UK) would be additional to the advertised price."}

It was the 1984 911 3.2 Carrera, reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1977. The 911 3.2 Carrera was the last iteration in the original 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling with new brake, electronic and suspension technologies. A new, higher-displacement motor, a 3.2-liter horizontally opposed flat 6 cylinder, was utilized. At the time, Porsche claimed it was 80% new. The new swept volume of 3164 cc was achieved using the 95 mm (3.7 in) bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's 74.4 mm (2.9 in) stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (although only 9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted. The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years. With the new engine, power was increased to 231 bhp (172 kW; 234 PS) at 5900 rpm for European markets. This version of the 911 accelerated 0-- 60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.4 seconds and had a top speed of 150 mph (240 km/h) as measured by Autocar. The bodywork is in the original Guards Red, a favourite of the time. Pin stripe black interior combination much favoured in the 1980's. In well presented, well serviced condition, supported by Porsche service book covered PDI to last service at 11710 miles. First registered in late December 1983, this 1984 model Carrera Targa was first sold by main Porsche dealer Malaya garages, and serviced by them until 1988, with a move to the North East in 1992, servicing then continued with Porsche specialist Tom Ferguson in Newcastle until our purchase of the car. With one owner from 1992 until 2015, with insignificant mileage since, this is an extremely original well cared for car, supported by both MOT and service history."}

Currently, it is still French-registered but will be re-registered in Jersey prior to sale. Showing some blemishes, the car was fully repainted in the original Moroccan Red colour in 2017. Exterior bodywork is in excellent condition. The underside of the car is also in very good condition. Finished in ivory leather, the upholstery is in excellent condition. The car has climate control, electric windows and a cruise control function. In 2017 the car was mechanically refreshed by a Jersey-based Jaguar specialist. The car is supplied with a Zytek engine management diagnostic kit (supplied to dealers and generally not available to the public). The Jaguar XJR-S is a very rare and sought-after sporting grand tourer. Fitted with an extensively uprated 6.0-litre V12 unit with Zytek fuel injection, coupled to a recalibrated three-speed GM400 automatic transmission, this model boasted a claimed power output of 334 bhp, and a potential 160 mph top speed. The suspension was appropriately improved to match the increased performance and the car sits on a set of 16-inch JaguarSport alloy wheels. A subtle bodykit was added to distinguish the car from lesser XJS models. Produced only in limited numbers this is a true collector's vehicle, in excellent condition and with only a relatively low mileage. A rare opportunity to purchase a desirable sporting Jaguar."}

{"name": "1986 JAGUAR XJS 3.6 MANUAL - EX FACTORY PROMOTION CAR - £19,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "C264 XVC is a very interesting early Jaguar XJS 3.6 Coupe with significant history and provenance. Our founder is one of Sir John Egan's 100 UK Jaguar Dealer Principals from the mid-eighties. He was puzzled when first looking at this XJS. An early car with the original softer suspension, but on a C registration with 1987 model year seating -- with the side bolsters on the seats and later wheels. Once we studied the history it started to make sense -- here was a rather special and important car. According to the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust, our December 1983 build XJS 3.6 with its newly designed AJ6 engine left the Browns Lane factory in 1986. Finished in Regent Grey with Saville Grey leather upholstery with 5 speed manual transmission it was first registered to Jaguar Cars Ltd of Coventry on the 12th May 1986. Confirmed in writing by Jaguar, we know the XJS was then used by Jaguar themselves for display and promotional work and was driven by their Team Racing Driver Martin Brundle as his Company Car. The XJS also has the distinction of having the September 1987 sports seats, later alloy wheels and colour coded front spoiler. Martin Brundle is best known as a Formula One driver and commentator for ITV Sport, BBC and Sky Sports and whilst finishing a close second to Ayrton Senna in the 1983 British Formula Three Championship, the two progressed to Formula One the following year. Martin Brundle was the 1988 World Sportscar Champion and won the 1990 24 Hours Le Mans race for Jaguar Cars in a Jaguar XJR-12 and is an important figure in Jaguars racing history.This Jaguar XJS has now covered 114,000 miles from new and comes with a comprehensive service history and all original manuals, handbooks and original leather wallet. The first three services were all carried out at Browns Lane in Coventry at 1204, 9416 and 15583 miles in 1987. Jaguar main agents Grange Motors serviced the XJS at 18771 miles and then Caffyns Jaguar sold the car and serviced it twice at 23535 and 29652 miles. From 1991 to 1993 Barretts Jaguar in Canterbury serviced the car at 35228, 40119, 43936, 47790 and 51121 miles. A Canterbury based service garage stamped the book at 56804 miles in 1994 before one Wiltshire based Garage took on maintenance stamping the book and servicing the Jaguar at 65210, 67624, 70998, 74813, 79334, 82679, 85709 and 88385 miles in 2003. Extensive service and maintenance receipts accompany the car detailing the cars history from 88385 to the current mileage of 114,000. Invoices from 2005 to 2007 from the North Wales Jaguar Centre total over £6,000 for maintenance and upkeep (to include radius arm bushes, steering rack gaiters, manifold gaskets, o ring seals on manifolds, rocker gaskets, shocker bushes, replacement crankshaft pulley and woodruf key, new fuel lines, new traction control arms, new front and rear brake discs and various bodywork and paintwork in order to keep the car in great usable condition. From 2011 to 2015 and within the last 4000 miles in the region of £3000 has been spent with Lord's Motors in Lancashire for various maintenance and servicing and since then, very little mileage has been covered. More recently, the XJS has been treated to a complete outer re-spray costing £5000 and as result, the car now presents in exceptional condition.C264 XVC has provenance, exceptional history and presents in lovely order. The Regent Grey paintwork is of a superb standard and the bodywork is in excellent order with bright, good quality chrome work. The sports leather seats are very original and superb, carpets excellent and the general presentation of the interior is of a remarkably high standard. The XJS has a clean well presented boot area, Jaguar tools are present and mechanically the Jaguar is in strong condition with a fabulous 3.6 litre engine offering impressive performance. The five speed manual gearbox makes this model much more exciting to drive. Having had in the region of £14,000 spent over the past 12,000 miles, C264 XVC is a stunning, usable XJS that still offers excellent value in a market where XJS' prices seem to keep pushing upwards."}

The Morgan had one long term owner from the 1980's and in 2011 treated the car to over £13,000 of work to the engine, braking system, steering and suspension. Since carrying out this work, the Morgan has covered over 7,000 miles and has been thoroughly enjoyed on club events, car trials and hill climbs. The owner was a member of The Monklands Sporting Car Club and some fantastic photos of the Morgan at various events to include the Annual grass Autotest at Coulter are with the car.This desirable four-seater Morgan is ideal for long distance touring. It has already proved incredibly reliable over the past ten years and feels tight on the road with impressive handling, sharp brakes, and a lovely strong engine with smooth gearbox.

The Morgan has clearly been well maintained, its totally on the button and has recently been treated to a new heater, brake master cylinder and new battery.PWM 958J presents very well with a high-quality Red paint finish. The paintwork is sharp, bright, chrome work is very good throughout with excellent bumpers and period 1970's hub caps. The Morgan comes with full weather equipment, is capable of all weather driving and with the added rear space is ideal of long-distance touring. This is a fantastic car, its superbly aged, extensively used and clearly treated to a high level of expenditure to keep it in such sharp condition."}
{"name": "1971 MERCEDES-BENZ 280 SE 3.5 V8 CABRIOLET - £265,000 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 56000 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "HORIZON BLUE DB-304 WITH DARK BLUE HIDE AND DARK BLUE MOHAIR HOODSPECIFICATION INCLUDES:- AUTOMATIC (DESIRABLE FLOOR-CHANGE VERSION) GEARBOX, LEATHER INTERIOR, ELECTRIC WINDOWS, FRIGIKING FACTORY AIR CONDITIONING, BECKER EUROPA RADIO, HIRSCHMANN ELECTRIC AERIAL. Hexagon Classics are delighted to offer this delightful example of the rare top-of-the range Mercedes Benz 280 SE 3.5 Cabriolet, which was hand built at their Sindelfingen plant. With only 1,232 units built, the top model cabriolet is extremely rare. This vehicle was purchased from a Pebble Beach, California, resident, who was just the second owner, and goes a long way to explaining its remarkable condition and originality. It remains in its original and stylish colour combination, and is complete with its original driver's book pack, including its manual, service guide and air conditioning handbooks.An official Mercedes Benz dating letter accompanies the vehicle, which confirms that it was manufactured in June 1970, and shipped to one of their dealerships in the United States. The craftsmen at Sindelfingen produced both the coupe and cabriolet versions of the 3.5, which were available with every luxury accoutrement that a buyer could wish for. This all made for an impressive, (and costly), automobile. The 280 SE 3.5 was to be the very last model to feature the W111's long-established and much-admired body style, with the last model slightly restyled, with a cleaner and flatter nose and radiator shell. The body still appeared modern and featured characteristic American-style tailfins that gave the models their \"Heckflosse\" nickname. Today these high-end classics are highly sought after by Mercedes-Benz collectors.The compact and strong 3,499 cc M116 V8 engine with its overhead camshafts and Bosch fuel injection, produced 197hp, and could propel the W111 3.5 Cabriolet to 100 kilometres per hour in 9.4 seconds and to a top speed of more than 200km/h. These figures were a substantial improvement over the six-cylinder version. Large vacuum-assisted disc brakes all round allowed the driver to slow with ease, and handling was described as very comfortable, thanks to its coil-sprung independent suspension. The fact that it is also a full four-seater only broadens the appeal.A comprehensive refurbishment was completed in 2016, which included a bare metal repaint, major servicing to all systems and a new convertible 6-layer mohair soft top. This car also retains the original tool kit and jack. Our 280 SE 3.5 Cabriolet is ready to be enjoyed by its next custodian.Available to view now at our London showroom"}

Remarkable even by our exacting standards, this one owner car from new; it had stayed in a private collection for over 20 years. This Z8 is the epitome of the modern classic.The BMW Z8 (E52) roadster was produced between 1999 and 2003 in very small numbers. Originally designed by Henrik Fisker, as an homage to Albrecht von Goertz 's wonderful BMW 503 and 507's of the 1950's. The Z8 was produced almost unchanged from the Z07 concept show car that had caused a sensation when shown by BMW at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show.The side-mounted turn indicators were integrated into the side vents in a fashion that rendered them invisible until activated. The vintage simplicity of the interior was preserved by hiding the modern equipment under retracting panels. Complex compound curves were preserved using an expensive MIG-welded aluminium space frame. The Z8's spaceframe was produced in the Dingolfing BMW plant, and the car was hand-finished in Munich. The taillights and indicators are powered by neon tubes that offer quicker activation than standard lightbulbs and are expected to last for the life of the vehicle. Due to the limited volume of Z8 production, all elements of the car were constructed or finished by hand.The Z8 uses a 4941 cc 32-valve V8, that developed 400 HP (300 kW) and 500 Nm (370 lb/ft) torque. This engine, known internally as the S62, was built by the BMW Motorsport subsidiary, and was shared with the E39 M5. The engine was located behind the front axle to provide the car with 50/50 weight distribution. The factory claimed a 0--100 km/h (0--62 mph) time of 4.7 seconds; magazine road tests recorded 0 - 62 times of 4.2 seconds!Our car was supplied by BMW Park Lane, London in March 2001 to its one and only keeper, and the running-in check & service was carried out at 1,428 miles. The last service was carried out by BMW Chiswick in May 2021 at 23,173 miles. The Z8 is complete with its spare remote key, and leather handbook wallet. A set of new Pirelli Corsa tyres have just been fitted, and the number plate \"28 GB\" will be included in the sale.BMW Z8 roadsters like this are becoming increasingly difficult to find, and Hexagon are extremely privileged to offer this stunning car. A great investment for the future without question, this low mileage Z8 is ready to be enjoyed. It will also be supplied with a written 12-month comprehensive warranty."}

Over 2 million were produced, and in recognition of such an incredible and storied past they decided to produce some Limited Editions for the 2015 and final year.\n\nThey produced 400 Heritage Editions, 600 Adventure Editions, and the rarest of the bunch was the Autobiography Edition. Exclusively available in the 90 inch wheelbase format, the purpose was to provide the ever-present utilitarian qualities the car had, and ability, with an extreme level of comfort considered into the equation too.\n\nOn top of the creature comforts they thought it sensible to increase power up compared to any other cars, resulting in 150BHP, and importantly for such a car there was 400Nm of torque. So purrs along wonderfully on the road and inside you feel ever so comfy as she has leather everywhere, heated seats, perforated leather steering wheel, aluminium door handles and air vent bezels.\n\nOur car is an extremely low mileage example of these Autobiography Edition cars, the rarest and most collectible end-of-production Defenders."}

Sellers for his son.\n\nIn period the Sebring was one of Maserati's best cars to date.\n\nJeremy Clarkson named the Sebring #77 out of 100 best cars of all time.\n\nGoodwood have listed her alongside the Birdcage, the MC14 and a few others as Maserati's best cars of ALL TIME.\n\nPetrolicious which we have all come to enjoy over the past 5 years or so, have a title for their video on a Maserati Sebring as:\n\n“Maserati Sebring 3500 GT Will make you fall in Love”.\n\nSo it is a good car, and it is true. Driving our fully restored example around London it really does fit all the hype. She is steady, easy, comfortable and responsive.\n\nThe 3.7L engine, twin plug head mated to 3 twin choke side draft Weber carbs, with a ZF 5 speed manual is hard to come by, especially in our fabulous specification, which only 49 other cars wear. Stylish. And you might expect that of such a car seeing it was purchased by Peter Sellers, actor and most famous for the beloved Chief Inspector Clouseau of the Pink Panther, but many others too.\n\nHe bought it as a gift to his son, Michael. A nice gift!! Who then used the car in Tennessee until Michael imported her to the UK in the 1980s. He used the car for a while, and in 2004 the most recent custodian was able to acquire her. She was immediately taken to Maserati experts in Austria for a full restoration for when they took over ownership, she was original - but tired.\n\nThe restoration was extensive, and expensive. Costing €150,000 and along with the documents are 150 or so photographs of the restoration being undertaken. Immense detail was gone into.\n\nEverything was restored to correct specification, except for the necessary change to the 45 Weber carbs, bought in Italy from Maserati spare parts dealers. The original Lucas injection is there still but better to use the webers. Ex-Maserati mechanics from the 1960s restored the engine, and advised throughout and all their knowledge was used for this particular engine.\n\nThe original paintwork after some research, and according to the Maserati archives of Olaf Boecking in Germany was Bianco Polo Park. Glidden Salchi who supplied this new doesn't exist anymore, however the original colour was used from PPG. Maserati did use both companies in the 1960s for their cars, so it wasn't a compromise.\n\nThe interior has been restored into immaculate condition as is visible in our photographs and as you might expect seeing the extent to the other aspects of the car.\n\nAs you can see from the pictures, the boot, interior, engine bay, underside, paintwork and bright work are all in \"as new condition\".\n\nThe restoration was completed in 2018, and about 250km have been done since.\n\nShe is ripe and ready for someone to enjoy what so many journalists that we love, like Clarkson, Petrolicious, Goodwood and many others, have referred to as one of the best of all time.\n\nCurrently registered in Austria so EU taxes have been paid.

{"name": "1989 VOLKSWAGEN GOLF V60 RALLYE GROUP N 4X4 RALLY CAR - £29,950 ", "transmission": " 5-SPEED MANUAL", "mileage": " 9442 Miles", "driver-position": " LHD", "desc": "The Golf Rallye was an homologation special from the late 1980’s, marrying the all-wheel drive system from the Golf Synchro to a Golf GTi 1.8-litre engine, to which Volkswagen’s engineers had added a G-Lader supercharger. The engine capacity was reduced from the stock 1781 cc to 1764 cc, so that it would comply with the FIA’s 3.0-litre class limit (a 1.7x multiplication factor was applied to forced induction motors). The G-Lader engine made 158 hp and 166 lb ft of torque, far more than the stock GTi and 5,000 Rallye were built. \n\nIn 1989, Volkswagen UK decided to get involved in British rally sport, and two Golf Rallye cars - the model already having been homologated - are known to have been imported for this purpose. One car was supplied to Gilders of Sheffield and prepared by Power Engineering of Uxbridge. The second was run by the Shell Gemini team, prepared by SBG Sport Limited.\n\nIt is the second of these cars that is on offer here, which was specifically built for and driven by former Volkswagen Junior Team Golf GTi driver Steve Davies. It first appeared in the initial rally of the 1990 National Championships - the Vauxhall Sport Rally in North Wales - and campaigned in the Shell Gemini colours of white and blue. It only completed one rally in this guise however, reportedly outperformed by the likes of the Ford Cosworth and the project was shelved. \n\nFollowing this early retirement, the vehicle was re-introduced to the world of rallying at the beginning of 1991, in support of the newly introduced Shell Rally Scholarship scheme. The car was repainted in Shell Helix colours (red) with David Llewellin as the named driver. Although not driven further in competition, it was used to publicise the Scholarship scheme. Following this, the Rallye was in the ownership of John Mulholland in Northern Ireland, from whom it was purchased by the current owner in 1994. The car then had a little competition use, being campaigned in the Channel Islands (1994 & 1995 Jersey Rallies and Guernsey Val des Terres hillclimb), but no further racing use since. It has been sparingly driven locally in Guernsey, dry stored and well cared for.\n\nMechanically, the supercharged 4-cylinder engine is mated to a standard five speed gearbox, passing power to the car’s four-wheel drive transmission. The car runs the original SBG Sport rally preparation, including Revolution five-spoke alloy wheels, fitted with wheel studs instead of bolts; Bilstein gas shocks together with spherical bearing top mounts. Critical bolts on the rear differential are lock-wired to prevent them coming loose. The car runs and drives very well, just as might be expected from a well-cared for, little used vehicle. \n\nThis is a professionally built, competition-prepared vehicle - the bodyshell is fully seam welded. There is a sump guard fitted and quick-lift rally sill jack together with oversized mud flaps and external electrical cut-off. Generally in very good condition, the bodywork does show some signs of its active competition history, but this is limited and confirms the light competitive use. The paintwork is original – the red Shell Helix colour scheme - although it was first finished in Shell Gemini colours of white with blue stripes, evidence of which can be seen under and inside the car. \n\nThis original and unmolested rally car is much as it was in 1991 and, having covered less than 10,000 miles in total, is probably the most original and unaltered works-supported Golf Rallye of the period. The Rallye was the subject of a feature article in the April 2017 edition of Volkswagen Driver magazine. \n\nThe Rallye is accompanied with documentation including some competition history, the MSA logbook and model-specific owner’s manual.\n\nThe car is currently Guernsey registered and we can assist with shipping and importation processes if required. Any import duties and transport costs would be additional to the price listed."}

{"name": "1971 JENSEN FF MK2 - £134,995 ", "transmission": " MANUAL", "mileage": " 0 Miles", "driver-position": " RHD", "desc": "This outstanding Jensen FF MKII was supplied new in Metallic Quartz with Tan upholstery, and first registered on the 1st May 1971. EEA 455J was registered new to Jensen Motors Ltd, West Bromwich and was an official factory demonstrator car. We have Jensen paperwork to confirm the FF was loaned to Charles Follet Ltd on the 9th July 1971, A.R.D Garages (Cwmbran) Ltd on the 24th September 1971, and almost two months later it was loaned to Wilmslow Motors. On January 3rd 1972 with 1100 miles covered, Newbury Motors borrowed the FF for demonstration purposes before being invoiced by Jensen Motors to Charles Clark & Sons Ltd in Wolverhampton at a price of £5,444 on the 4th January 1972.\nThe Jensen stayed in the West Midlands throughout the 1970's, and in 1978 sold to Ironman Firegrates Ltd in Sutton Coldfield. In 1981 the FF sold again to a private owner who kept the car for almost 30 years, based initially in Bristol and then back in the West Midlands where the car has spent most of its life. In 2010 the Jensen was sold and moved to Northamptonshire where it spent five years during which £16,000 was spent on the car. Over the five-year period from 2010 to 2015 the Jensen brakes were overhauled and treated to re-conditioned calipers, discs, pads, flexi hoses and master cylinder. Wheel bearings were replaced, ball joints replaced, a new voltage regulator fitted, a new exhaust rear section fitted and the carburettor rebuilt. Further work included resealing the oil pump, fitting various new coolant hoses, new starter solenoid, new power steering hose, rectifying the faulty air-conditioning system, replacing drive belts, new HT leads and regular servicing. The gearbox was also serviced and treated to new selector shafts and new seals. Cosmetic improvements included thousands of pounds being spent sympathetically restoring the original correct and lovely Beige upholstery and fitting new front and rear bumpers at the cost of £1790 alone.\n\nEEA 455J first arrived with us in 2018 with a mileage of 81,000 and had spent three years with a Harrogate based collector. Having been dry stored for three years, the Jensen was then subject of £25,000 of work. The FF was fully stripped down and treated to a full re-paint in its original colour of Metallic Quartz and bodywork to include new rear wheel arch sections and new front valance. The Jensen was mechanically overhauled and treated to new anti-roll bar bushes, spring eye suspension bushes, new shackle assembly, new ball joint boots, re-conditioned steering rack, re-conditioned brake servo, rebuilt braking system control unit, new oil cooler, new coolant hoses and the air-conditioning system was rebuilt and re-instated. The Jensen was treated to five new tyres, new mirrors, new seat belts, new window regulator and all serviced items replaced, ignition items replaced, and all lubricants changed.\n\nSince being first supplied by us in late 2018, the Jensen has been taken to the next level of detail. One of our regular customers in Sussex completed a comprehensive program of detailing and ensured the car was in a condition where it can immediately compete at show level. Great expense went into into sourcing a correct set of re-conditioned wheels, a genuine MKII FF handbook at a cost of £700 and many nuts and bolts were replaced to ensure the highest standards of finish. The engine bay was extensively detailed, as was the underside of the vehicle, inner wheel arches and boot compartment. The beautiful largely original upholstery was stripped down, deep cleaned and put back together, and the FF returned to us in exceptional condition. We then supplied the car to its most recent owner in the North West of Scotland who has continued to further improve the car spending over £11,000 on work to include a major re-wire, new leaf springs, spring eye bushes, rear shock absorbers, engine mounts, new thermostat housing and gaskets and the car now returns to us in beautiful order having covered around 2000 miles of touring in the time away frim us. The car is cosmetically outstanding, and the mechanical condition and performance, handling and general driving is first class in every respect and the FF returns with 84000 miles covered from new.\n\nThe FF is an iconic motor car, launched in 1966 it was immediately voted Car of the Year by the Motoring Press due to its outstanding technical ability. FF, Ferguson Formula was the four wheel drive system developed by Harry Ferguson for racing cars that split the torque unequally between the front and rear wheels giving the car outstanding handling qualities for a GT car of this era. Combined with Dunlop Maxaret anti-lock braking, another first, this led pundits to call the FF the worlds safest car. Only 320 FF's were made before production ended in 1972, and just 107 MKII examples were ever made and many consider the MKII to be the ultimate model fitted with the sportier 6.3 litre V8 engine. Considering the rarity of this model, its fabulous original colour combination, recent re-commissioning work and of course the provenance of being a genuine factory demonstrator with low mileage and still retaining a great deal of originality, this car is no doubt a wonderful car to own, treasure and importantly enjoy with its amazing performance. The perfect grand tourer, this is an incredibly special car that has been taken up to a superb standard throughout."}

This particular car has also been Immortalised and now features in the definitive AMV8 reference book, the 'Aston Martin V8’ by Palawan Press.

This incredibly usable, superbly aged example has been local to us in the Malton area for the past two years and has been driven on a regular basis. During the two years of ownership, the De Tomaso has been improved and superbly maintained with £9500 of expenditure with a local Porsche specialist. Work has included braking system maintenance, removal of the engine and gearbox for detailing, various new gaskets, new clutch, slave cylinder, new water pump, new exhaust system, and various ancillary powder coating. The Pantera has also had a brand new headlining fitted with our trim shop Malton Coachworks. The recent owner has maintained the car with no expense spared and its arrived absolutely on the button.\nGoing back to the car's early life, it was supplied new in Italy before being imported into the USA in 1972, delivered to the state of Oregon. The De Tomaso was owned by an Oregon based Doctor and the car stayed in the same US State for its entire time in the US. By the late 1990's, the long term owner passed away and the De Tomaso was put into dry storage. The Estate sold the car in 2012, and at this point the De Tomaso was imported into the UK.\n\nOn arrival in the UK, the car was fully inspected, found to be rust free and then re-commissioned over a 12 month period by a classic car restoration specialist in Bedfordshire. The Pantera stayed with the same UK based owner until 2020 and whilst used sparingly, it was well maintained with an upgraded cooling system/fan upgrade, carburettor overhaul, new shocks and springs, suspension bushes and ball joints. Brakes were also overhauled with new calipers and a set of factory correct Michelin XWX tyres fitted.\n\nStill finished its original colour of Spring Orange (Arancione a Molla), the De Tomaso is a very original looking car with a delightful patina. This is a very nicely aged, usable car, it feels genuine and very honest, and has a lovely sharp body and excellent underside. The interior is similar, it's very well presented and feels ‘right'. This clearly has never been a car left to deteriorate, its strong, sound, and on the road still offering ferocious performance from its reported 360BHP engine. BVM 228K is quick, sounds fantastic and is brilliant fun with its fit, powerful and loud engine, enjoyable, smooth gear changes and impressive exhaust note. All the electrics work, the car feels very well sorted and offers the opportunity to own a true supercar icon at very sensible cost. It's a car to jump in, and have some real fun....."}
