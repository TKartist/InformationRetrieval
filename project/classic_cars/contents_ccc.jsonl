Power is supplied by a 390cid V8 and backed by an automatic transmission.\nThe attached picture is a screenshot referenced from the \"Vintage Thunderbird Club International, Original Factory Specifications, Volume 4, November 2002\" magazine. As indicated, there were only 17 \"M\" code Hardtop models produced in 1962, \"seventeen\". That alone makes this car very rare. This car is a survivor and to my knowledge, all equipment on this car is original except items that would have been replaced due to normal wear. If the person that purchases the car desires, I still have all the parts I have had replaced. Features include a Swing-Away steering wheel; power windows, door locks, and driver’s seat; factory air conditioning; and 48-spoke Kelsey-Hayes chrome wire wheels. Many new parts have been installed including the tires, brakes, fuel pump, fuel lines, brake booster, spark plugs, and wires. This Rangoon Red Thunderbird with a reported 58,874 original miles and a white leather interior comes with receipts, parts records, and a clear title.\nMy restoration efforts have all been focused on getting the car back in road worthy condition, which it is. I have not had any interior or exterior cosmetic processes performed on this car. This will allow the new owner to put their stamp on the car by performing only the work they want.\nThis Rangoon Red Thunderbird hardtop reportedly still wears its factory chrome and stainless trim, emblems, and handles. The original headlights, grille, and bumper can be seen at the front. The factory bumper with integrated taillights and fuel door is mounted at the rear. The seller states a cosmetic piece at the bottom of the antenna is missing and there are spots of rust at the back wheel well. There is no rust on the underside of the car.\nA set of 14-inch chrome 48-spoke Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels with tri-bar center caps are wrapped in 215/75/14 whitewall tires.\nThe interior is furnished with original white leather front bucket seats with factory seat belts and a matching rear seat. This Thunderbird features the Swing-Away steering wheel. With the transmission in park, the steering wheel and column slide 18 inches to the right, allowing the driver to exit the cabin easily. The steering column is topped with a three-spoke white steering wheel with a chrome horn ring.\nThe padded dashboard is white on the bottom and contrasting gold on the top, split by ribbed trim that flows down into the center console, which houses a 120-mph speedometer, a clock, and a fuel/temperature gauge. The odometer shows 58,874, which the seller states is accurate.\nThe engine is an M-code version of the 390cid V8. The M-code option featured three two-barrel Holley carburetors and produced 340 horsepower. Factory chrome valve covers, a finned open-element air cleaner, and new spark plugs and wires complete the engine. Factory power brakes, air conditioning, power steering, and a mechanical radiator fan can be found under the hood.\nAccording to the seller, it was originally purchased by the late Aurelbelle Shaffer, who was the wife of the late Raymond Shaffer, the former president of Greyhound. Aurelbelle drove this Thunderbird as her second car and always kept it parked under a carport in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 1992, the car was placed in a storage facility in Arizona and kept there until it was moved to Georgia in 2010. The car remains in a building and has only been driven very sparingly since 1973. Receipts for parts and service work will be included in the sale.\n"}

It was specially ordered when new to be equally at home on a boulevard... or on a racetrack. It has a racing engine, gearbox and chassis. It is restored to 100-point level for Concours d'Elegance competition, and is the winner of numerous prestigious concours awards. But most importantly, as the premier example of 1930s French coachbuilding, this beautiful automobile can be seen and valued as fine art, with all the implications for further appreciation that the fine art market commands. Mobile art; “A true movable feast for the eyes.”\n“The chassis 46864 is correct in all respects”\n-- Club Delahaye France Archives\nRarely do competitive racing chassis and engine and imaginative aerodynamic coachwork come together in the same car. This was Figoni et Falaschi's signature style applied to a convertible... the new flowing streamlined coachwork for which Figoni-Falaschi would become internationally famous. It most dramatically illustrates Figoni’s famed streamlined creations, in this case for a wealthy Parisian named Wolf, a personal friend of Figoni’s. Wolf could afford the best of the best, so he challenged Delahaye and Figoni to create a car with elegant line, fine et elancée, with the fast and reliable Competition 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine, and the competition chassis... bearing in mind his intent to race the car and enter in rallies, as well as concours events and various showings for Figoni.\n“This is one of the most elegant creations of Joseph Figoni\nand one of the most important Delahaye cars.”\n-- Club Delahaye France Archives\nThe Delahaye Type 135 Competition long-wheelbase chassis was a factory competition special, ordered by Monsieur Wolf to satisfy his purposes of personal use, concours events and racing requirements. At Delahaye, the competition engine was placed into the rugged Type 135 Competition chassis, a durable advanced design for its time, proved in the coming years at races like the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nThis Delahaye 135 Competition Convertible has been authenticated by Club Delahaye France, and Figoni records, as the original body (Figoni # 581) and chassis (Delahaye # 46864) with all pertinent numbers on the car matching the original Figoni and Delahaye records.\nThe Competition Engine. The car is powered by a 3.5 liter (3557cc) overhead valve, 120 horsepower, inline six-cylinder Delahaye engine, foundry-marked T35 (built in 1935). It is coupled to a rugged 4-speed manual competition transmission with synchromesh on the top three gears. This car was ordered with the competition engine version, with a matched set of triple downdraft Solex 40PAI carburetors, a higher-compression cylinder head, an oil cooler, and two fuel fillers in the trunk.\nThe engine and 4-speed competition gearbox are positioned low in the chassis, thus contributing to the benefits of a better-balanced vehicle.\nIn the front, you'll find an independent suspension using transverse leaf springs as the lower control arm (see accompanying photos). Powerful brakes and 17\" Rudge-Whitworth chromed wire wheels with 5,60 x 6,00 Michelin tires were fitted. The wheelbase is 116 inches, front track is 54 7/8 inches, and rear track is 58 3/4 inches.\nOther special competition components include:\nWhen Joseph Figoni took delivery of Wolf's rolling chassis from the Delahaye factory, he set out to make the most streamlined body possible. He wanted the convertible top to be lowered within the body. Today, we take this complex process for granted. But back then, Figoni, a streamlining pioneer, had to invent a very effective disappearing top for this car. The folding mechanism is described in French Patent 795.769, «Perfectionnements aux véhicules décapotables», applied for October 1, 1935 and issued January 13, 1936, just preceding the construction of this car.\nThe Type 135 Competition would be successful on nearly every venue in which it competed. It earned victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Monte-Carlo Rallye, the Paris-Saint-Raphael race, several Grand Prix races, and many other events both before and after WWII. In 1937, a year after this long-wheelbase 135 Competition was delivered to Monsieur Wolf, similar Type 135 Competitions won the Monte Carlo Rallye, and placed first and second at Le Mans. And our car, so beautiful at Concours showings, is an integral part of that championship heritage, itself placing 6th in the 1949 Monte Carlo Rallye out of a field of 230 cars, in an extremely difficult and dangerous race on the rutted muddy wreck-strewn roads of post-war Europe.\nThis flowing teardrop is Figoni one of one piece unique, combining the Delahaye identity in the grille and hood with generous teardrop fenders flanking Marchal headlights tucked tightly to the grille and a pair of separately controlled Marchal fog lights fitted low below them. The fender shape is echoed at the rear with skirts enclosing the rear tires. Chrome accents highlight the fender trailing edges matching the chrome accent sweeping back from the peak of the grille, down across the doors then filling the rear fender joint and small chrome spline down the rear deck. The lines are beyond stunning.\nMonsieur Wolf granted the privilege of showing his car to his close friend Figoni, for tours and other showings of the new streamlined coachwork. Figoni himself drove this car, as Wolf’s eyesight was poor enough to limit his driving. Later, Wolf hired the famous French racing team of Guy Mairesse and Paul Vallée to campaign the car in various racing events. We have a photo of the team piloting the car in the Rallye de Monte Carlo in 1949, kindly supplied by Claude Figoni, Joseph’s son.\nYou'll appreciate the gorgeous interior's sparkling jewel-like engine-turned dashboard, soft and supple light gray (gris) quill ostrich leather seats and door panels, piped in dark blue leather. The light-colored upholstery is a perfect complement for the stunning Bleu Foncé exterior and works perfectly with the turned pattern dash and beautiful wood accents. Carpets are dark blue as is the soft top and trunk lining. There are so many small touches that make this car unique -- like the upswept curve at the center base of the folding windshield, a theme picked up on the polished wood door panels, and on the upholstery. And, the car also has a set of matching fitted luggage as per the original build sheet. The luggage is finished in reverse colors of dark blue (bleu foncé) quill ostrich with gray (gris) edging and handles. The entire ensemble of internationally competitive streamlined teardrop wind-cheating luxury coachwork is simply breathtaking.\nIn excellent 100-point condition, she's ready for the next owner to take to the finest concours or rally events and compete for Best Of Show with every prospect of success. She? Mais oui... ceci est une belle voiture française, après tout!\nRefined meticulously detailed elegance and streamlined design combine masterfully with competition engine and chassis in this piece unique objet d’art, consistently judged to be one of Joseph Figoni’s finest creations. Show, tour or simply stare at her; a visual feast; to be savored and enjoyed as both movable art and a solid investment.\n"}

These days, however, the straight-six pony car is fast becoming a unicorn amid the popularity of both factory-original and V-8-swapped Mustangs. The Ford Mustang is one of the longest surviving breeds of a classic pony car, and the generation that started the line has aged well.

There's no letup to quality as you focus your attention towards the awesome 60's Mustang steering wheel; the expanse of blue that is contrasted with the chrome. The instrument panel whose assortment of stock gauges are in decent condition, however, the gas gauge does not read. Just below, you'll notice the factory installed under dash air conditioning system which needs repair. We all love the originality of these vehicles.

Chrome bumpers and molding are in good condition. A newer Ford Motor is installed giving more horsepower. This buy also comes with the stock engine which is a Thriftpower I6 200ci 3.3L.

What makes this car stand out is its factory styling done to perfection; all its exterior trim is present and in excellent condition, with the current owner reporting new chrome trim. For that added factory appeal, this 50s beauty sits on its factory hubcaps that are wrapped with whitewall tires, with the driver having the option to fine-tune the ride height through an adjustable airbag suspension system. Matching the two-tone red and white exterior is a matching interior. Like the exterior, the interior is factory spec and made to stand out and stay true to character.

The dealer attributed the failure to fatigue in a weld—as it is a complete assembly part. There was not a mark on it—it simply just failed. The tires were also replaced at about 40000 miles.

Only one part is worn out on the car and needs to be replaced; the gas tubes on the trunk have dried out—they need to be replaced.

The year 1950 brought wider bench seating with deeper cushioning, a fused circuit-breaker electrical system and an improved version of the Chevrolet Thriftmaster inline 6-cylinder engine with larger exhaust valves and Rochester Power-Jet carburetor. This restored and rebuilt Chevrolet 3100 series 5 window is an outstanding example of the half-ton light-duty commercial pickup that helped reshape the way America drove trucks. The faithfully restored 216 CI Thriftmaster six was rated for 92 HP at 3,400 RPM with a single 1-barrel Rochester carburetor and is backed by a 3-speed manual transmission with a steering-column-mounted shifter. The engine features the optional oil-bath air cleaner that could trap and hold up to 2 pounds of dirt. Inside the ventilated custom 5-window cab is a brown leatherette-upholstered bench seat for three-across comfort and factory-issued style. A heater helps keep the cab comfortable on chilly cruises. Telescopic shock absorbers replaced earlier lever-action units in 1950 for an improved ride. The restored cab and pickup were painted into a two-tone cream-over-green color scheme with red Chevrolet lettering and pinstriped accents. New wood for the box floor and side rails was varnished to a deep finish. The signature Advance Design 4-bar horizontal grille with integral running lights is chrome plated to shine with the front bumper and guards, fog and headlight light surrounds, outside mirrors and rear bumper. The restored icon of American history rides on body-color-painted steel wheels with new Chevrolet-logo hubcaps and trim rings equipped with new Firestone whitewall tires. A matching spare stands ready on a custom-fabricated side mount.\n-5-window cab\n-216 CI overhead valve Thrift Master engine\n-3-speed transmission\n-Straight body panels\n-Refinished in original style Light Green with Metallic Gray fenders and roof\n-Believed to be 28,000 miles\n-Varnished wood box floor and rails\n-New Firestone wide Whitewall tires\n-Hubcaps and trim rings\n-Chrome grille\n-Deluxe oil bath air cleaner\n-Heater\n-Front bumper guards\n-Fog lights\n-Outside mirrors\n-Custom side mount spare tire\n"}

This Impala has been meticulously restored and updated for cross country cruising. The interior and exterior are both in most excellent condition, and the car is garage kept and never driven on a rainy day. The body has ZERO rust, as this is an Arizona car. The top is, as new, and the rear glass is truly glass. The power top works just as it should, as do the power windows. There is a parade boot for the car, though admittedly I've never used it. The Impala includes a state of the art sound system, and is set up for Sirius XM. The sound system is installed such that the radio appears as original. Underneath the car is also as new, with all parts replaced less than 5,000 miles ago. It offers aluminum wheels and wide tires for good traction. The engine is a 454, badged as a 396 to match the Impala's factory badges. The engine has headers. The Impala comes with an automatic transmission, with torque convertor for improved gas mileage. The car also has factory air conditioning that has been updated and uses current coolant. The radiators have been updated with new aluminum units and electric fans for cooling. The car drives straight and true, and quickly and easily does the 75 or 80  miles per hour today's vehicles often run on the interstate. The rear end has new gears within the last 2000 miles that leave it with plenty of get up and go, but that provide a good highway ride and serve to improve the gas mileage. If you want to smoke the tires, she still does that easily. The car is upgraded with 4 wheel disc brakes and has electronic fuel injection. If the car is to continue to be licensed in South Carolina, it has a mint condition 69 license plate that is already registered to the car. If you are looking for a daily driver, a show car, or a cross country cruiser, this one car fits all those bills quite nicely, plus it has all the room that cars of this vintage offer. Serious offers considered, but no trades and no dealer calls please. The investment in this vehicle exceeds the asking price, but it was a true labor of love to make it this nice!  \n"}

This gorgeous Mustang has received a top 8 nomination at the Salon de l’Auto Sport Quebec 2023 and is a standout at it is built to be driven hard and enjoyed on the road as well as in car shows.\nThe history of the Ford Mustang dates to April 17, 1964, and it was named after the P51 Mustang Fighter Plane from World War II. A legendary plane built to fight for freedom and a car specially made to enjoy this freedom. The history of the iconic Ford Mustang doesn’t stop there, the experts at Fougal Creations have created a new modernised version of the legendary Mach 1 Mustang.\nThis stunning Mustang Mach 1 started life as a true 1969 manual red with black hood Mach 1. The vehicle received a full restauration including a brand new dynacorn chassis reinforced and upgraded by Fougal Creations for a modern feeling of rigidity.\nOnly then the car entered in a 3500-hour restauration and modernisation project. The custom widebody was specially crafted to fit the 10-inch wider track offered by the modern suspension. Every body panels have been completely redesigned by the team at Fougal Creations. This stunning widebody was designed to enhance the exquisite original lines of the 1969 Mustang while incorporating a set of modern aerodynamics features. A custom set of lightweight 19 wheels wrapped in Michelin super sport tires improve the beautiful legendary lines of the Mach 1 which gives the car a lower stance and a very aggressive look.\nThis Mach 1 is running a fresh 5L coyote engine breathing thru a high rpm Boss 302 intake bolted to a 5 speed Tremec transmission. This 440hp Coyote engine delivers the power to a modern 8.8 limited slip rear differential. The sound design of the custom crafted 304 stainless steel side exit exhaust system has an exotic low muscle car rumble throughout its 7500rpm rev range.\nThis feeling is continued inside where a lot of time were invested into the design, material choice as well as all the small details, like the billet aluminum GT40 toggle switches in the custom center console. The details of the redesigned interior match the sharp exterior styling of this Mach 1. With modern Dakota digital gauges, to the carbon fiber door cards and X brace, to the two sport seats arrangement with a parcel shelf including storage and the space grey interior billet aluminum pieces. A cold blowing AC system and electric windows have been fitted for a more comfortable driving experience.\nThis Mach 1 is finished in the Ford GT MKIV red with black satin accents and unique Fougal Designed MACH 1 decals to match the incredible quality of the bodywork. From trim less windows and front end, to the light buckets vents, every details have a dual purpose in functionality and design.\nThis Mach 1 was created to be thrilling to drive as much as it is to be looked at. Be the first to enjoy this car has it is fresh out from the factory located in Québec, Canada.\n"}

There is no rust in the body. There are photos included of the wheel wells showing this.  The wood is original except for some small repairs, and is in good condition.  The fabric top was replaced within the last 15 years, and is in good condition.  A set of metal drip edges for the top were acquired by the previous owner after the top work was done.  He felt that the edging was well done when the top was replaced & did not justify tearing it up to install the steel ones.  They are included in the sale.\nMechanical:\nAt some point before the previous Owner’s purchase a Ford 8BA flathead V-8 was installed.  He installed a new radiator, shroud, & Drake high efficiency water pumps, and it runs cool even on hot Savannah days.  He had the car rewired including a plug for the boat trailer.  The boat trailer currently does not have lights or wiring. A vintage turn signal kit was installed when the wiring was done, & it works great.    All lights & the horn work.  The radio & gauges were rebuilt when the wiring was done & they work fine.  Previous owner replaced the gas tank, generator, voltage regulator, carburetor, and stock lever action shocks.  Since purchasing the car I have installed a Pertronix ignition system w/ Pertronix plug wires and coil, new spark plugs, a new alternator charging set up, all new Bendix/Self Adjusting brakes on all 4 wheels, and a new 6 volt battery.\nInterior:\nThe wagon has all 3 seats.  The leather seating surfaces are in excellent condition with no visible wear, rips, etc.  I installed all new rubber floor mats from front to rear with insulation.  I also installed new interior & exterior mirrors, sun visors, and rear window hardware.  The previous owner installed new dash plastic, & rebuilt the gauges & radio. \nChassis & undercarriage\nAs stated above the brake system was replaced with Bendix/Self Adjusting drum brakes.  The mufflers were replaced with new glass pack units received when the car was purchased.  The dual exhaust system is tight and not objectionably loud.  There is an electric fuel pump near the tank that has been replaced under my ownership, & it works fine. Other than mild surface rust & grime the chassis is in fine condition.  There are no noted leaks from the brake system. The tires are  relatively new Coker radials that are in good condition.\nDriveability\nI keep a 6 volt Battery Tender on the car, and it starts easily, comes to an easy idle with some use of the choke, warms quickly, and drives out with no problems.  Let’s face it – this is an 82 year old vehicle that is built more like a piece of furniture than a modern car!  Steering does not shimmy but can be somewhat vague.  Brakes, even w/ the Bendix units, are not 4 wheel discs.  Leave room in traffic! \n1953 Fleetcraft Runabout & 15hp Evinrude Outboard\nBoat: from what I can find 1953 may be the first year that Fleetcraft made a fiberglass hulled boat.  There is no data plate or serial # on the boat.  The previous Owner bought the boat at an auction in PA, which makes sense since Fleetcraft boats were originally made in SE PA.  He bought it because the hull color is such a good match w/ the wagon, plus the wood deck & interior.  The hull, wood deck, & interior are all in great shape, and do not require any current work. \nEvinrude Fast Twin 15hp outboard can be identified as a 1953-1954 model from the Serial #15012-01914. Since I had no plans to put the boat in the water I put oil in the cylinders, pulled it through a few times, & have not attempted to start it.  There is a 6 gallon portable fuel tank that goes with the sale.\nTrailer: I replaced the tires, tubes, and wheel bearings.  Installed a trailer dolly to aid in storage. \nFun Fact: The last two years, 2021 & 2022 I have been invited to bring the woody & boat to the Hilton Head Island Concours d’Elegance for their 2 day “On the Water” display of antique water craft.  They got a lot of attention!\n"}

This is the solid-lifter version of Zora Arkus-Duntov’s legendary small-block, which features among its attributes the GM block casting number (3782870), head casting number (3782461), intake casting number (3844461) and even the No. 2818A carburetor under the chrome air cleaner. A fresh water pump and battery are among its more recent refinements. The high-winding engine is backed by a close-ratio Muncie 4-speed transmission and a 4.11:1 Positraction rear end. Other unique points of interest are the knock-off wheels with white-stripe tires, side-mounted exhaust pipes, Teakwood steering wheel and optional AM/FM radio with power antenna. The interior also features the redesigned cues for ’65, such as wide-padded bucket seats and molded door paneling with arm rests. Coupled with the first big-block models arriving at mid-year, many consider 1965 to be a pivotal season for America’s Sports Car. In terms of color, only Tuxedo Black came on fewer editions in 1965 than Goldwood Yellow, and the driveline options on this example make it a standout in terms of true street performance.\n-Cosmetically restored 2017\n-Detailed engine bay and underside\n-Correct Goldwood Yellow exterior\n-Auxiliary hardtop -Black soft top\n-327/365 HP V-8 engine\n-Close ratio 4-speed transmission\n-4.11 Positraction rear end\n-Teakwood steering wheel\n-Knock-off wheels\n-AM/FM radio with power antenna\n-A.O.

That project was under way when 911 happened, which is why it has the design that it does. This vehicle  was build to be driven, daily if you so desire, that is what it is for, to drive, and have fun, not to just be parked and looked at. When I drive the car I always get the thumbs up sign from other drivers and pedestrians. The car is a magnet. And it's fun to show it off even though it's more fun to drive.\nThe picture section depicts the two prior stages the vehicle was in prior to its road to completion.  \nThe Sierra Gold pictures show the condition when the car was acquired and restoration started  \nThe prime photo's show in stage body work and then the finished product.\nIncluded with the car is all of the invoices of work performed and receipts of parts purchased  that I kept while on this mission.  I have not added up the total of all the paper work that now fills a 3” binder. I also have a complete FMV appraisal done 10/2023, that will come with the car. \n"}

The engine is run through a five-speed manual gearbox with a two-speed transfer case and locking center differential for ultimate off road control. In addition to everything that comes on a standard Defender 110, this car has been modified by UK Defender specialists Arkonik with a host of welcome upgrades.\nOne of the signature features of Arknonik are their body kit and wheel packages. On this example, a stunning set of gloss black painted fender extensions are paired with a purposeful looking front bumper mounted brush bar and black painted diamond plating on the fender tops and along the bottom of the body. Black painted side steps and a Front Runner roof rack with rear ladder add practicality to the rig and a fantastic look. The standard 16\" wheels have been swapped out for an 18\" set of Khan Design wheels painted in black and shod in knobby BFG K02 off road wheels with a matching rear mounted spare. All of the lighting has been swapped out to LEDs and auxiliary units have been added to the roof rack and brush bar. The interior has been thoroughly upgraded with high quality black and tan leather interior and the front seats are heated. A set of black all weather floor mats cover the black carpet and a large center console offers extra storage and cup holders for the front passengers. The Arkonik build on this Defender was completed in September of 2016 and shows just over 14,000 miles since the completion of the project.\nArkonik Options\n"}

The truck has no signs of rust and is a very clean rig inside and out. The truck has been undercoated as well as the bed of the truck. Other features include a dual-range transfer case, a chrome front bumper and trim, side body moldings, a rear step bumper, dual exhaust outlets, a push-button radio, and a heater. The clutch was replaced in July 2022. This International pickup rides on a 132″ wheelbase and has “Eight 200 All Wheel Drive” badging on the front fenders. White-painted 16″ steel wheels wear gray International hubcaps and are mounted with Power King Extra Traction tires. The truck is equipped with manually locking front hubs, and braking is handled by front discs and rear drums. The interior was refreshed under previous ownership, and the bench seat has been reupholstered in blue vinyl. Features include a cabin heater, lap belts, a black dash-top cover, vent windows, and a push-button AM radio. A three-spoke steering wheel frames a horizontal 120-mph speedometer, an ammeter, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The truck is powered by a 345ci V8 that was rebuilt during the refurbishment and is equipped with an electric fuel pump. The truck also had a Holley Fuel Injection installed last year that makes this rig run flawlessly. Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. This is a remarkable truck that gets compliments everyone it goes and is questionably one of the nicest Series 200 truck around today.\n"}

Each throttle-body feeds one bank of cylinders on the v8 engine. This gives it 200 horsepower at 4,200 rpm and 285 lb.-ft of torque. During full throttle a solenoid operated door in the hood opened to allow air directly into the air cleaner. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. This car can move.\n1982 corvettes came with a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and a lockup torque-converter clutch - breakthrough technology at the time.\nThe collector edition includes standard features such as power steering and brakes, a telescoping and tilting steering wheel, pop up halogen headlamps, full instrumentation such as fuel, oil pressure and temp gages, tachometer, and voltage.  Four-wheel independent suspension.  Limited slip 2.87 differential.\nAn authentic Collector Edition Corvette will have a “0” as the sixth character in its VIN as this car does.  Production was limited to 6,759 cars.  This makes this car a rarity.\nAbout this Collector Edition Corvette \nI Bought this Vette here in Maryland in late 1984 from a GM mechanic who loved it but couldn’t afford it.  It had about 20,000 miles on the odometer. Today it’s 61,000 miles.\nFor a few years I commuted in it, before making it my weekend ride. It’s always been garaged, even at the office.\nMy employer paid for all maintenance and repairs, so nothing needed was missed.\nTo my knowledge, the car has not been in an accident and the engine is original.\nRestoration\nOver the past 12 months, I’ve invested over $10,000 in restoration. All documented.  Including:\nAdditional Features \nAlso included is a custom cotton dust cover and a framed poster of the 1982 Collector Edition Corvette.  The dust cover is especially helpful for protecting the car in your garage. I have the original keys, as well as several copies.  Plus, the original T-top leather storage covers, original owners manual and the Chevrolet Corvette service manual are included.  See photos.\nNotice the champagne leather T-top bracket bag in the back - this is for the optional: (V54) Roof Panel Carrier.  It contains mounting brackets for the T-tops when they’re off the car.  I have included photos of the mounting frames.  They’re like new.  I’ve never seen these offered for sale in like new condition.\nNot a Perfect Car\nThere is a scratch on the passenger door, which I’ve shown in the photos.  I had a recent quote of $350 to repaint the door.  I’ve also highlighted a few other flaws, no matter how trivial, in the photos.\nAside from the Air Conditioning, all power features and gauges on this car work.   The air conditioning compressor runs, but needs Freon.  The rear windows on Collector Edition Corvettes nearly all have problems opening due to the design flaw in the hinges.  The release handle on this car does not allow the rear window to open.\nWant to learn more?\nI’d be glad to put a prospective buyer in touch with both the local Corvette mechanics who’ve recently worked on the car.  They’re more than happy to speak with you.  You are also welcome to hire a mechanic for an independent opinion on the car.  Of course, I will answer any questions you might have to the best of my knowledge.\nAsking Price \nThe asking price is not arbitrary nor based on an inflated opinion of the car’s condition.  After much study, I set the asking price based on the recent sale of a Collector Edition Corvette, in very similar condition and owner history.  That car sold for $29,400 at auction sixteen months ago. Auctions are a strong indicator of true market value.  I’ve observed at least eight other completed auctions of similar vehicles in that price range in the past two years.  Allowing for the air conditioning and the scratch on the door, I’ve set my price slightly lower.  I believe it’s a very fair market price for this car. \nWhy you should seriously consider this car\nBuying this car is like stepping back in time to 1982. It’s in showroom condition. \nI love this car, but I’m selling it to make room in my garage for some other projects.  I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it, but now it’s time to pass it on to bring joy and someone else. \nWhen I sell a car, my name goes on the bill of sale.  There should be no surprises for the buyer.  I’ve made every effort to be candid about the true condition of the car. \nEvery repair expense since I’ve owned it is fully documented and indexed in a binder.  See photos.  These records are included with the car so you can protect your investment.\nWhen you buy a car from a dealer, you don’t know the history of ownership and care.  This dramatically increases your risk.  With this car, you have a wealth of information available to you.  Including a 40-year ownership history.  Plus the recent investment of over $10,000 in restoration.  All fully documented.\nA quality classic corvette is an investment.  They always go up in value.  If you compromise your standards, and buy a low priced, low quality, classic car, you’re setting yourself up for failure if you ever choose to sell it.  But if you buy a high quantity specimen, like this one, and take good care of it, you’ll do very well if you decide to sell it.  That’s far more important than bargain hunting or haggling for a great deal.  Think strategically about the long game for your investment.  Don’t let this one get away.\nSummary\nThis is a high end, recently restored collector vehicle.  If you want a C3 Collector Edition Corvette in original condition, that you won’t have to spend time and money on to drive and enjoy after you invest in it, with a known and documented history, this car won’t disappoint you.\n"}

This award winning 67 GTO Hardtop Coupe was ordered from the factory with special metallic paint “Plum Mist” and factory air. While this was a GM color, Pontiac stopped offering plumb mist on the GTO in 1966. Born in Pontiac, Michigan on October 31st, this special order GTO was delivered to Smith Motor Company in Laurens, South Carolina. Years later the car was found abandoned in a Texas auto body shop, when it later underwent a complete frame off (1/16) rotisserie restoration in 2016. The car has its numbers matching Pontiac 400 4bbl with 335hp,  three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic TH-400, which was equipped with a Hurst Performance dual-gate shifter, called a \"his/hers\" shifter, that permitted either automatic shifting in \"drive\" or manual selection through the gears. Everything works as it should and it is documented that the car has been driven less than 2600 miles since restoration. It has always been stored in a climate-controlled garage.\nThe car comes with restoration documentation as well as Pontiac Historical Society’s documentation of the special paint code and window sticker. It received the “Restored Auto” award at the 2021 Good Guys car show. All sheet metal is original other than the hood which was purchased after the original was damaged by the sand blasting process. The exhaust and headers were replaced during restoration and provides a great rumble from the stock 400.\nDesigned by John DeLorean, the Pontiac GTO is considered of the most desirable cars of the muscle car era. The 1967 is often considered the most desirable, featuring sleek design updates to the hood, grill and taillights. I am sad to see my baby go, but it is time to turn over the keys and let someone else enjoy this classic icon of American car history.\n \n"}

When finished, it was gifted to his nephew, a newly minted Medical Doctor. In the interim the Doctor had accepted a position in France, so he took possession, drove to Minneapolis then sold it to me in early November 1977. Since then it has been meticulously maintained for a very demanding Mechanical Engineer. Effectively I am the original owner although technically the car has been mine for 46 years less the few weeks it was in transit.\nIn Minneapolis the car was stored in a heated garage from October to May every year until 1986 when it was relocated  to California and then to Arizona, where it has been garaged ever since. \nThe 1977 Corvette is a beautiful automobile, but this model year also had some significant disappointments. The 1977 Corvette is a 3500-pound sport car designed to operate with 350+ horsepower. By 1977 the L-82 engine output had been reduced by almost 150 HP due to “emission controls”. in my opinion, this model with 210 HP is underpowered and, even with the California Emission Certification option installed, it still failed to meet California or Canadian emission standards. \nThe shortcoming was addressed by Twin City Racing in Minneapolis who Installed an Edelbrok performance intake manifold and in 1984 after a 2-year year search installed a factory set of 2.17 Chevy heads. Estimated improvement 100-115 HP, several years later a custom exhaust system was fabricated and installed. The factory  double “y”– single cat converter system was replaced with larger diameter straight pipes utilizing exhaust routing layouts designed into the Corvette frame. Another catalytic converter and twin high bypass mufflers completed the design. The results were amazing! Emissions for hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, idle and loaded, were roughly 90% lower than Arizona mandates.  A copy of the last emission test is attached.\n \nAs this Corvette sits today, it has roughly 350 horsepower, was licensed in California for 14 years and had no problem passing California emission protocols. If the buyer prefers a “Survivor” car most original factory parts are like new, including AM/FM stereo radio, clock, radiator tanks, set of 2.02 heads, intake manifold and other spare parts. It was last repainted in 1997.\nIn 2004 Mike Scott, a Corvette judge and owner of Corvette Corrections in Anaheim California appraised the car for “not less than $20,000” ($32,200) in 2023 dollars. In the appraisal he also said “this is one of the nicest 1977 Corvettes I have inspected. It is also one of the rarest by color combination. Black exterior and smoke gray leather interior. This car has been kept in very good condition inside and out. This vehicle is also highly optioned.” \nA copy of the appraisal is attached. Maintenance log is available.\n \n \n"}

This car comes with both the Muncie and Borg and Warner 4 Speed transmission. \nThis car in magazines:\nMore pictures: http://www.mjpropix.com/Cars/Impala-Super-Sport/ \nChevrolet brought real power to the people during 1961, and did so with style. The midyear introduction of the Super Sport option package showcased another new arrival, the 409-CUIN V8.\nThe SS kit was offered on any Impala. It included Super Sport trim inside and out, chassis reinforcements, stronger springs and shocks, power brakes with sintered metallic linings, spinner type wheel covers, and of Chevy’s earliest uses of narrow band whitewall tires. The dashboard gained a Corvette type grab bar, and the steering column got a 7000 RPM Tachometer.\nOnly Chevy’s toughest V8’s were offered with the SS package. It was available with 348-CUIN with four-barrel or tri power. The other choice was the 409. Essentially a larger displacement 348, its upgrades include forged aluminum pistons, a wilder camshaft and 11.25:1 compression. A single four-barrel mated to the aluminum manifold. It made 360 bhp. It also made history.\nChevy built 491,000 Impala for ’61. Only 453 had the SS package and of those, just 142 got the 409. But word spread quickly.

Did it work? As an engineering triumph, you bet. Though Hemi-headed engines had been used by racing and high-end brands in the pre-war era, it took Chrysler to bring them to mainstream America in the post-war era. Among other advantages: The shape of the combustion chamber allowed a central spark plug location for more efficient fuel ignition, and valve sizes grew because they didn't rub shoulders with one another, as they did in conventional engines. A better burn and bigger valves meant more power. Chrysler's Hemi weighed in at the same 331-cu in displacement as the mighty Cadillac V-8, and the Mopar put out 20 more horsepower. And Dodge dropped theirs into every body style it offered: coupe, sedan, wagon, convertible, whatever.\nDisplacement grew rapidly, as did Dodge's cars, through the 1950s: an overbore in 1955 brought displacement to 270 cubes and 150 hp.  The Century's hemispherical V-8 lasted into the mid-1980s. Since that time, the term Mopar has basically become synonymous in automotive circles with any Chrysler-built vehicle, which would include Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, Plymouth, Imperial and DeSoto.\nCarburetor:\nTransmission:\nShifter: \nFront Suspension:\nFour Wheel Disc Brakes\nShocks:\nWheels & Tires: \n \n"}

The condition of the body reflects the mileage and doesn't show any sign of wear. There is not a stonechip in the paint, not even in the wheel wells. The ''Springtime Yellow'' paint which is the original color, is immaculate. Nice finish, no scratches or stonechips, and definitely no rust. Gaps between the panels are perfect The undercariage is also perfect, it was completely sandblasted before being repainted in the original ''Red Oxyde'' primer, and oversprayed with the exterior color, exactly how it would have been from factory. It originaly came with the ''Lower Back Panel Grille'' Exterior Decor Group, which includes the following: Pop-open Gas Cap, Chrome Wheel Wells modlings, Fog Lights, Louvered Hood with Turn Signals.\n \nThis one is a ''C-Code'' and was equipped with a 289ci with the a 2bbl Autolite 2100 300CFM carburator. The original engine is still in the car, was rebuilt during the restoration. It has about 91 miles since rebuild. We just did a complete tune-up and drove the car to make sure everything was functionning properly due to being stored for a long period of time. The original C4 Transmission was replaced for a rebuilt 4-Speed Toploader. Rear end is still the original 8'' with 2:79 gears.\n \nIt also came with the optional Power Steering, front Power Disc Brakes, Tinted Glass, A/C and AM Radio.

This head turner is not only a collector but will make other riders jaws drop in envy!! NO JOKE. Everyone loves this bike when they see it. If I didn't have a wedding to pay for I'd keep it forever. \nIn response to the sales success of smaller Japanese bikes in the 1960’s, Harley-Davidson formed a plan to offer a new small-displacement machine to compete as its own small-engined Hummer model left a lot to be desired. Around this same time Aermacchi was interested in focusing more resources on its aeronautical division and allowed Harley to grab a 50 percent stake in Aermacchi’s moto-division for just $250K. Aermacchi fit the bill to a T as far as what H-D had in mind as the Italian marque produced a solid little 250 that possessed a lot of potential for further development.\nThe 250’s that were born out of this arrangement quickly proved themselves in competition, taking various podium spots in high-profile and prestigious events like the lightweight class of late 60’s and early 70’s TT’s. Around this same time, the quarter-liter Italimerican racer was taken and bored out an extra 100 cc’s, resulting in the 350 which was produced from ’69-’74. Unfortunately, the more impressive characteristics of the race-bred 350’s – such as its short-stroke cylinder dimensions and five-speed transmission – failed to trickle down to the production model racers, leaving the 250’s and 350’s to finish at the bottom of the pack in magazine class shootouts of the era. As a consolation prize, the Harlimacchi did get the best gas mileage of all the machines in its class at 47-58mpg.\nAt the heart of the Sprint 350 was an air-cooled 344cc OHV single that produced a claimed 25 hp at 7,000 rpm and had a reported top speed of 92.49 mph (presumably with a jockey-sized pilot and a solid tailwind). The bike had a “half-wet” (half full fuel tank) weight of 323 lbs, and sold new in 1969 for $795, an amount that translates to a little under $5.5K in today’s money. The Sprint wasn’t a particularly hot seller in the States, though it did do better after being given a new name. When it first arrived on American shores the Sprint was initially dubbed “The Wisconsin”. And while sales might have been satisfactory at dealerships in the Green Bay area, it didn’t attract many buyers from outside the bike’s namesake state, and thus the moniker was changed to the Sprint which could be appreciated on a more universal level.\nDespite them both being production models, far fewer 350’s were produced than 250’s, making examples noticeably more rare and therefore valuable. I won’t get into the debate on whether or not people should be resto-modding rare classics (especially when there’s a lot more mod than resto), but I will say this 350 has been thoughtfully – and tastefully in my opinion – upgraded. While its appearance is subjective, it’s almost impossible to argue with the mechanical and performance-related upgrades that have gone onto this 1970 350.\nStarting with the engine, this SS350 was given a new Wiseco race piston, new carb and K&N air-filter, new valves and guides, new gaskets and seals, and new clutch disks. The ignition and electrical systems have been refreshed via a new Power Dynamo 12-Volt generator and voltage regulator, new 12 volt ignition coil, points, condenser, and spark plug all made by Pertronix. According to the ad, there are also a handful of unmentioned upgrades and parts.\nOther non-mechanical upgrades include new cables throughout, new chain, new fork seals and O-rings, a NOS “H” model fuel tank, new Pingel fuel shutoff-valve, new gas-cap, new rear-suspension, new cafe-style seat unit and saddle, new hardware and fasteners throughout, and a new 12-volt headlight and taillight. This little orange runner is also sitting on new Akront/Italian-style flanged alloy rims wrapped in new vintage Firestone Deluxe Champion rubber.\nEvery surface on this 350 is pretty immaculate with pristine paint and all metal surfaces having been adequately polished. The orange and black paint digs are unmistakably Harley-Davidson racing, and there appear to be a lot of individual NOS parts such as the chrome pipes and even the vintage H-D footpegs look brand spankin’ new. Because only 25 miles have been put on this machine since its resto-mod job, as it currently stands it’s more or less a museum-quality example. I personally like it, but was this a job well done? Or is this just sacrilegious to do to a seldom-seen classic?\n"}

It has won countless first-place trophies from Best of Show, Best Engine, Peoples Choice, and has been featured in Street Roder, Hot Rod, and JEGS magazines. The engine is a well thought-out 350 Small Block Chevy 4-Bolt Main with consultation from B&M and multiple mechanics. The motor was built from the ground-up designed for this specific blower configuration--it was not a retro-fit. Because of this, this motor is trouble-free and runs like new. Similar builds face overheating and calibration troubles. This motor stays at or below 180 degrees idling on the hottest asphalt, driving in parades, or cruising on the interstate. The whiskey keg trailer is custom-built to be towed as a luggage carrier and meets the pivot-clearance of the wheelie-bars. There is a vinyl top and second widow that are optional with included vinyl zip-in windows. \nMechanical Details: \n1978, 350 Small Block 4-Bolt Main, automatic 3-speed transmission, B&M Power Charger 250 Blower,  B&M Race CAM, Keith Black pistons, 2 - 600 CFM, 4 barrel Edelbrock carburetors, stainless steel fuel lines and a 1/2\" line to support the 110gph Edelbrock fuel pump, Edelbrock air/fuel ratio monitor, polished BDS hood scoop with K&N air filters, MSD boost retard timing master ignition, Taylor plug wire, electric cooling fan, stainless steel Cool-Flex cooling system, VDO PSI and turbine gauges, Boyce MotoMeter. Estimated to produce 600hp. Chevy rear end. \nT-Bucket Highlights: \nThe metallic paint color appears to change from pink to red depending on the lighting and angle. One of a kind McLean spoke deep-dish wheels that will never be built again to fit the Mickey Thompson Sportsman 29X15.50-15LT street slicks. Dual-action B&M StarShifter, powder-coated frame to protect from road rash, chrome-mirrored fire wall, radio with speakers, turn/brake signals, ahoooga horn, classic Ford instrument package (water temp, oil pressure, MPH, fuel, battery voltage), battery kill-switch. Recent maintenance: carburetors have been recently cleaned, new battery, oil change, new fluids, new plugs, overall inspection from top-down. \nTrailer Highlights:\nThe authentic wooden whiskey keg trailer is a huge bonus that in and of itself is of value. Every time you open the trailer, the smell of whiskey hits your nose. The \"PLATTE VALLEY BOURBON\" lettering was carefully crafted using real gold flake and chrome lantern signal/brake lights. \nAdditional Details: \nThis one-of-a-kind T-bucket is highway worthy and show ready. The motor is nicely broken-in and has the classic racing CAM whine that everyone loves to hear. This T-buckethas been in weddings, parades, commercials, and magazines. You cannot appreciate this car until you see it in-person and then behind the wheel. Clean titles for both the T-bucket and trailer. I am willing to help coordinate transport if necessary--both the T-bucket and trailer fit on a flatbed car-hauler.\n\n \n"}

For the Fifth Production Cycle offered between 1967 and 1971, T-bird enthusiasts have assigned the name Glamor Bird. The label is certainly appropriate, as this was the largest and most luxurious Thunderbird offered to date. In a further departure from the traditional Thunderbird image as a Personal Sport-Luxury Automobile, the Convertible body style was discontinued. In its place, a four-door model was added to the lineup, officially known as the Landau with a wheelbase of 117.2 inches. This longer T-bird sedan chassis was shared with the Lincoln Continental Mark III. Since they were both born in the same factory in Wixom-Michigan.\nTo add some more distinctive features, the rear doors were hinged at the rear and opened from the front, the arrangement famously known in the years past as \"Suicide Doors\". In most other aspects the four door T-bird was virtually identical to its Coupe sibling, with a luxury cabin and every available convenience gadget of the era. Priced in the $4800.- to $5500.- range, the Glamor Birds were far and away the most expensive cars in the Ford lineup, priced at a few thousand more than a comparable Galaxie or LTD. \nFor the 1970-1971 model years, all the Glamor Birds including the Landau Sedan received new front-end styling and tail light section as well. The prominent protruding nose a.k.a. \"Bunkie Beak\" and tail light lenses - resembling spread wings - was a favorite of then Ford President Semon E. \"Bunkie\" Knudsen. The '70-'71 model years were the best built Thunderbirds to date. Printed circuitry, introduced in 1968, continued to make the instruments reliable and accurate. Thunderbird's dignified ride was designed by computer. Their interiors were pressure tested at the Factory to check for air leaks. Since this body style had been around for four years, they left the Assembly Plant pretty much perfect. The Thunderbirds for 1970-'71 were the most elegant looking and very dependable due to a strong and smooth running 429 Thunderjet Engine with four-barrel Carb. paired to a C-6 Automatic Transmission, complete with a Dual Exhaust. \nPerhaps at some point in the future, the question posed will be, \"Whatever happened to four door Thunderbirds?\" Already rare to begin with, when these cars are finally given the recognition they deserve, prices will go through the roof. For four-door T-bird Collectors today, their wisdom and insight will no doubt prove to be a prudent investment for them!\nThe beautiful four-door Landau made its final appearance for 1971, with a production number of 36000 total Thunderbirds produced. Of those, only 6500 were made as four-door sedans. This particular example has the bench seat, where only 2300 were created! \nThis desirable piece of Automotive Design and History is highly coveted and sought after by experienced Collectors and Investors alike as a Legacy to the Car Designers of the past! It is the rarest of all T-bird model years. This stunning specimen in particular, wears an exterior that is presented in a striking Burgundy Fire Poly with color matching disc hubcaps and captivating Onyx Black Metallic Roof, that accents the contrasting Landau Bars very well and spells Pure Class! This color scheme is paired to an inviting Cream Interior with plush Red Carpeting.\n The car, though mostly original, has only been mildly restored to keep its authenticity. The undercarriage still has lots of \"Ziebart\" Rust Protection left. It comes with a new starter, brake booster, new battery, power window motors, new tires, complete new exhaust system (front to back) and all fluids changed and is ready to be enjoyed! Also included are two spare sets of hubcaps (dog dish and turbine style), rear window, windshield, grill, headlight bezels, cornering lights, chrome oil pan and a front bumper guard which was a rare option! Delivery in an enclosed Transporter, within B.C. and Alberta included in price! Loosing storage space for the upcoming Winter Season, therefore open to reasonable offers!\n"}

I have the original delivery book - registration in Italian hand filled out to the first owner... It has never been shown or advertised.

This vehicle is a piece of history in many facets. automobile history, Italian cars, Detomaso, Pantera history. This car belongs in a museum or someone who wants it for their collection. This car also has a very interesting original owner history which I can discuss with potential serious buyers. Please No trades or time wasters this is a very rare once in a lifetime offering.

Fiberglass (W25) Outside Air Induction hood with lock down hood latches and fiberglass rear wing. Original date coded SSIII wheels painted to Matador red body color. Complete new black bucket seat interior including headliner, Rally Gauge Pack, power steering and front disc brakes. The original motor is long gone but it currently has the Factory Warranty 455 cubic inch replacement engine (rebuilt). There is no VIN stamped on block pad. The pad is still cast and has never been machined. Original date coded aluminum intake manifold and also original to the car is the M22 4 speed Rock Crusher transmission (rebuilt) with original Hurst shifter and center console. The car also features the original “TO” coded rear end with 3:73 gears and an added W27 rear end cover along with an aluminized exhaust system.  Red inner fenders, new windshield, new bumpers and an odd, not often seen option, is the B85 window reveal trim molding. Extremely clean inside, outside and underneath. In my opinion this is a high number 2 car. I have documented the restoration of this car on a thumb drive with about 200 photos. Furthermore, I have a 2-3 inch folder that contains receipts of parts, labor and titles from previous owners from years gone by. My research has indicated the production numbers for 1971 Oldsmobile 442 W30 is 810 hardtops and 247 4 speed cars. The 442 styling and color combination make this W30 a constant head turner and gets the thumbs up where ever she goes.\nI purchased the car from a co-worker approximately 11 years ago. He was not the first owner. Possibly the second or third owner. The best that I can recollect from his story is that over 20 years ago or so, he dated his wife in this car. Then a variety of issues came about, mainly leaks but the car was still running good. Shortly after getting married and buying a house the car went into hibernation in his garage and had been sitting in his garage for about 15 years. The odd but true story is that he and his wife bought a modest house with a 1 car garage. So up until the time I bought the car his and his wife's daily cars sat outside while the W30 was garaged. When I met this co-worker I already had a 71 442 convertible. He asked me to come by his house to show his wife what a restored 442 looked like and take a look at his 442. This next part I remember very well. When he opened the garage door it just hit me that I had not asked him (if by some outside chance) it was a W30 and he said yes it was and it was also a 4 speed car. As I entered the garage I saw the “W30” badges on the side of the fender. The next day in work he asked me if I would be interested in buying his 442 W30. I wasn't looking for a project car but I couldn't turn down a W30. So we struck up a deal with one stipulation, that I would restore the car and not part it out. I agreed, purchased the car and started on an approx. 1 year complete frame off rotisserie restoration.\nI don't know every detail about the history of this W30 and neither did my co-worker friend that I bought the car from. But through my years of (on and off) research I have compiled what I believe is the history of this car. This car was built in May of 1971. It appears that during the warranty period the motor was damaged. It also appears the motor was replaced with a 1972 W30 Factory Replacement Block and possibly Heads. Being that the car was originally built in May of 1971 that left only 2 months of 1971 manufacturing before the factory would start tooling up for the 1972 models. So that is why I believe within those 2 months or while the car was still under warranty, the motor was damaged and replaced with the 1972 motor.\nFinally, along with the car goes 4 extra date coded wheels, misc. stainless steel trim, a die cast model and a car cover. \n \n"}

Originally was a floor plan unit ordered by Studebaker Memphis and left the South Bend factory on September 17, 1963. Car was delivered to first owner for near list price one year later. Has dealer installed air conditioning, which is almost exactly the same installation as from factory. Factory options included the climatizer (heater), disk brakes, and the 3-speed Power Shift transmission. The original odometer read in the 80,000 range, but inspection of the condition of things indicated a lot more than that, but maybe not a roll-through to 180,000. The entire speedometer quit about ten years ago, and was replaced by a \"brand new\" out-of the box NOS unit. It now reads @3,200 miles since then. The car is driven only in the summer, and only around town.\nThe car comes with the records of all done to it after purchase. A lot. Actually, almost everything. The front end completely rebuilt. The engine was torn completely out and entirely rebuilt from boiling the block to new pistons, hard valve seals, and just about everything else. The multi-page initial repair bill comes with the car. It was essentially a new 289 and Powershift transmission attached to a rebuilt front end as well as attention to the 3.31 rear end.\nPertronics electronic ignition has been installed.\nThe rebuilder - Mountain High Performance - was known as the regional Studebaker expert, as the owner started out working at Denver's largest Studebaker dealer. There are a lot of things specific to Studebakers that traditional mechanics can miss.\nAccessory components also replaced later on. Replaced AC compressor and clutch in @ 2007. Did blow cold, but have left it alone since then, mainly because when you need AC, weather is hot. That means the constriction of air due to the front condenser makes the car run hot, too. So, here driving up and down the Colorado mountains in the summer, it has not been used. A new alternator installed in 2012, as well as a new power steering ram and kit in 2017.\nHas Studebaker AM/FM radio - rare for 1963-64 - which can likely be brought back to life. These cars only had one speaker - in the back - so surround sound isn't in the cards.\nSummary: Now, about 6,000 miles on a completely and professionally rebuilt 289, starting with boiling the block and moving up from there. Hardened valve seats installed with new bearings, high compression pistons, and installation of 4-barrel manifold and new Edelbrock carburetor, raising the engine to essentially 225HP JetThrust configuration. Front end reworked. Drives very nice. Studebakers tend to be prone to vapor lock with today's gasoline. An auxiliary electric fuel pump is installed to assure flow and can be turned on when necessary.\nIn the 17 years since re-build, traditional Studebaker leaks have come back, but none apparently are anything serious. A couple of drips here there, probably.\nThe car has been owned by people interested in collecting. It appears that the exhaust system (dual) was somewhat newer when it arrived here. Front and rear bumpers were either NOS or rechromed and, while stock, were obviously not the parts on the car when it first left South Bend. Orher than a minor chip on the front cowl, the chrome is really excellent. Other brightwork is ok and there are a couple of pieces extra.\nThe real value of this 64 Hawk is its mechanicals. I wanted a 64 Hawk I could drive, not necessarily win shows. Cosmetically, it has been pretty much left alone. Please understand that appearance-wise this car is a 20-footer. Over the years some liberties have been taken with attachment of some brightwork, and the re-paints are several kilometers from perfect. Have not found any meaningful rust.\nThis Hawk is great for everyday driving and going to the local classic car shows. Because the mechanics have been addressed, it would be perfect for someone wanting to use it as a solid base for addressing the cosmetic flaws. The headliner, wind lace, and upholstery are okay, but are worn.. The point here is that they are all attached to a Studebaker into which a lot of investment has been made in making it mechanically sound.\nThe interior is pretty much original. Bucket seats are comfortable. Carpet was replaced, probably. The dash has the tachometer, which was an option the car did not originally leave the factory with.. A sending unit from an Avanti was located and it works fine. The clock was the original electric-wind unit from the factory. It was rebuilt with a quartz movement by Auto Instruments and keeps time perfectly. Other gauges work great, and there are a couple of back-up gauges in the trunk. Gas gauge sender has been replaced, but it still reads whatever it feels like. The important gauges - oil, temp and amps - work.\nThe 3-speed floor shift PowerShift automatic transmission was completely re-built. Still has 2nd-gear start, with selected 1st gear start. Very smooth runner. Current TigerPaw tires have @ 1,500 miles on them and ride great.\nA lot of paperwork comes with this. The original dealer sticker, and the build document from the factory, also. The sales document from when it was first sold at a Mississippi dealer indicates that the buyer seemed to have paid full sticker for the car. And financed it too. Most of the invoices from the work done on the car come with it.\n \n"}

The rally homologation special with modern accommodations and drivability VIN# WDB10702612002636 (European VIN #). 68,500 Miles, Silver Metallic, Gray Leather, Burl Walnut Console and Dash. All Leather Interior. NEWLY 2019-2020 REBUILT Aluminum Block V-8 Engine (ABOUT $12K) with less than 1000miles on the rebuild (500 of those were purposely put on for post-rebuild adjustments) - done with Mercedes factory parts by a German owned/operated Mercedes Specialist shop and have all receipts. NEWLY STRIPPED AND PAINTED (JULY 2020) at cost of over $10k, NEWLY CHROMED BUMPERS )($2.5k),NEW MICHELIN XWX 205/70VR14 TIRES ($1.6k) summer 2020 with less than 200miles on them - same as Ferraris had in the 70's & 80's as couldn't bear to put on anything but the best), NEW REAR WINDSHIELD (we're told was last one in the world, shipped in from Dubai) All Modern Amenities including air conditioning (needs a/c hose and washer fluid pump which we keep trying to get but warehouses/parts network in Germany not presently functioning well for these older parts), power windows and power steering. Factory Sunroof. Spare Tire, Comprehensive Service Records.\nI've had the car since 1992 and have driven it about 4-5,000 miles since. Had it up to 150mph through the desert on the way back from California after I bought it there so the top factory speed of 143 is incorrect. Engine was rebuilt as it was burning oil and now it's fine - all the receipts are in hand and it was done by a German owned and operated small import repair shop in Chicago as referenced above. The German owner (they specialize in Mercedes) would probably be happy to answer questions about the rebuild and the car upon special request but I don't want to burden him with calls at this point. Likewise the car was stored for a long time and I wanted to get it back to 100% shape looks wise so I had Joe Filek at Captain America Designs in Hampshire, Illinois (people ship him their cars from all over the country and he is backed up about 2-3 years) do all the stripping and body work at a cost in excess of $10k and had him re-install the re-chromed bumpers.\nUpdate 8/8/2022- although $2k Climate Control Servo installed the system needs some kind of repair on that. \nThis Mercedes-Benz manufactured Homologation Special Edition was specially built in production form to qualify for FIA racing standards, meaning in order to competitively race Mercedes-Benz had to create at least 1000 production vehicles to accompany official rally cars it wanted to race competitively.\nThe 450SLC 5.0/500SLC coupes were produced by Mercedes-Benz from 1978 to 1981 and are among the rarest post-war models. They were manufactured by Mercedes Benz to homologate (make competition race worthy) the 5 liter for road rally purposes. Some cars were competitively campaigned with factory support, but the rest of the production was sold to the European market to meet homologation guidelines.\nThe combination of the lighter weight and higher horsepower made for a quick and competitive car which raced successfully with the introduction of the 5 liter engine in the World Rally Championship Series including First Place finishes in 1979 and 1980 at the Ivory Coast Rally. Other notable participation in competition included the Rally of Argentina, Rally of New Zealand, Acropolis Rally and Portugal Rally. The cars were given massive factory support under the leadership of Eric Waxenberger. The fact that the Managing Board of MBAG officially withdrew from world rallying in 1980 makes the 5.0 the last factory-sponsored wholly Mercedes model. The rally racing clock for Mercedes-Benz ended for good with the success of this homologated SLC special.\nThe Last photo in the gallery is of500SLC Rally cars - Four 450 SLC 5.0 being cleaned at a rally in 1979\nAlong with the performance enhancements and plaudits which are detailed below, this car's comfort and daily drivability combined with every modern amenity led renowned championship drivers of the time period to use them as personal get-arounds.1979 World Champion Driver of Ferrari Team Jody Scheckter chose this as his personal car. Jean Pierre Ganier and Patrick Depailler of the Tyrrell Formula 1 team also chose the 500 as their daily drivers.\n2769 of the 500SLC's were made over 2 years in 1980-81 and fewer than 100 cars were imported into the United States. In 1999 Mercedes-Benz SLC specialist Bob Hatch of Hatch and Sons estimated that at most there might be 50 of these cars in the country good enough to interest a collector, but in the years since his statement, given the drivability of the these cars, there are certainly significantly less than that at present. The example be offered here is certainly in the very top echelon of those Mr. Hatch was speaking of due to its meticulous care over the years and frankly I'd be surprised if there's one in better condition after the engine rebuild and bodywork/painting re-chroming, re-'tiring'- and all the miscellaneous new parts - anywhere.\nThis example differs from the stock 450SLCâ€™s in several important and distinctive ways. The hood and trunk lids are made from aluminum for significant weight savings. The car weighs 3,333lbs, 220lbs less than the standard SLC. To emphasize the lengths to which MB went to upgrade the car for homologation, it even has an alloy air cleaner to add to the weight savings. The front and rear aerodynamic spoilers the factory added result in a 9 â€“ 10 % reduction in wind resistance and a top speed which exceeds 142MPH. The 5.0 is the very first Mercedes-Benz aluminum block V-8 production motor and is lighter than the standard iron block . It produces in excess of a whopping 300 HP and 350lbs of torque and true blacktop powerhouse in its day. The 5.0 engine features factory reworked heads with larger valves, pressure fed valve adjusters, cross-bolted main bearing caps (4bolt mains in hot rod parlance) and many other special tweaks. The 500SLC also features the upgraded 4-speed automatic.\nThere's a window until late October/early November where this car is for sale/viewing/driving as it won't see a drop of rain or snow and certainly not salt while it's under my care.\n \n"}

The amount of attention this car gets is unbelievable.  If you want something that you rarely see and that no everyone has, this may be the right car for you! See below. \nGTM Gen II was acquired in 2016 and the build was completed late in 2018. It was assembled and completed by a professional shop.\nThe car is based on a tubular frame chassis (this is the Gen II that came out in 2012. So any issues with the Gen I where perfected and modified for the Gen II's), and the composite body is finished in yellow over a black interior (had thoughts of wrapping the car in a different color. I am not a fan of yellow). Power is provided by a mid-mounted GM Crate 6.2-liter LS3 V8 paired with a new Mendeola SDR5 five-speed manual transaxle for maximum horsepower (not a Porsche transaxle), and additional equipment includes a custom roof scoop, carbon fiber rocker panels, 18″ wheels, C5 Corvette-sourced braking and suspension components, a Kooks exhaust system, air conditioning, a Pioneer multimedia receiver, and more as detailed below. This Factory Five GTM is now offered with build records and a clean Arkansas title listing the car as a 1964 Ford GT coupe. This is not a donor car. Everything is BRAND new on the car. Either bought from GM or directly from the manufacture. \n          The bodywork is composed of aluminum and composite panels over a high-strength steel space frame chassis with an integrated six-point roll cage and contoured roof bars. This Car is finished in yellow with a black vinyl stripe and is fitted with optional carbon fiber rocker panels as well as a functional roof scoop. Additional equipment includes aluminum VRaptor Speedworks louvers, fog lights, and a rear carbon diffuser.\n          Staggered 18″ Forgestar wheels measure 9″ wide up front and 12″ in the rear and are wrapped in Nitto tires sized 245/40 and 335/30, respectively. The General Motors-sourced suspension features custom adjustable coil overs with Koni dampers, and braking is handled by C6 Corvette calipers over vented and cross-drilled rotors (front and back). 6 piston calipers I have also installed high performance dustless break pads.\n          The cabin is finished in black with yellow trim on the center console. Fixed-back black leather seats feature suede inserts and STV Motorsports five-point harnesses, and additional features, \nA Vintage Air heating and air conditioning system, power windows, Factory Five-branded floor mats, and a 6.2″ Pioneer DVD receiver with door-mounted speakers. With backup camera, Bluetooth and touchscreen for easy use.  \n          A three-spoke steering wheel on an adjustable steering column fronts a carbon fiber bezel housing Factory Five-branded instrumentation that includes a 200-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer, along with gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The digital odometer shows just under 1,900 miles.\n          The mid-mounted 6.2-liter LS3 V8 crate engine is paired with a Mendeola SDR5 five-speed manual transaxle. A custom wiring harness was supplied by SMC Performance of Auburn Hills, Michigan and additional electrical wiring was provided by Painless Performance Products of Fort Worth, Texas. A Kooks stainless steel headers and exhaust system exits from either side of the license plate.\n          The battery, master cylinders (Wilwood set up including break pedals), (Vintage air extreme) air conditioning components, and a Dewitts radiator with twin electric fans are located under the ducted composite hood. An eight-minute narrated video provided below details the equipment and includes in-car driving footage. Alot of attention and detail was put into this cooling system with oversized radiator and fans. \n \nI purchased the vehicle for my Girlfriend and after 3-4 times of driving it she felt cluster phobic in the car. She has had some pretty exotic cars and said this car drove and handled better than any other car she had. We both agree on that. We also both agreed the car \"floated on air\".\n \n I had over 36 cars and sold a bunch and not really interested in trades but if you have something you can text me at 501-844-0000. \n \n"}

A former 1968 & 1970 Winternationals Stock “D” Class contestant. 1964 Pontiac GTO, 389 Tri Power, 4 Speed, 17,862  original miles. Rare Sunfire Red color  (factory discontinued after 6 months due to lack of interest). Believed to be the lowest mileage Sunfire Red Tri Power 4 Speed in existence.  It is also estimated that less than 5 Tri-Power 4 speeds were built in this color.\nHere is the story. This car was originally factory ordered by Bob Weyrick while living in Ohio, to be used strictly for drag racing in Southern California.  He took delivery in Portland, OR. , to get around the California Smog issues. When he arrived to pick up his car, he asked where it was. They pointed to his car and said   “it’s right there”. Bob said he didn’t order that pink looking color. It turns out he had marked the wrong box on the order form. There were 3 different “reds” offered that year, Marimba Red, Grenadier Red and Sunfire Red. He decided to keep it and off to California he went. Bob settled in Lompoc, CA. and began drag racing   “THE OLD GOAT”.   Bob (he’s passed now) said that 12,000 to 14,000 of the miles on the odometer are from being  “flat towed” to the various drag strips around Southern California. There is tons of race history included with the car along with a large inventory of parts.  More on that later. The car was raced in the mid to late 60’s. Included are lots of time slips from local drag strips in the 1960’s ….Santa Maria Drag Strip, Riverside Raceway, Lyons Drag Strip and The Pomona Winternationals. Lots of other drag racing memorabilia, brochures from the 1968 & 1970 Winternationals in Pomona, CA…with his name and car listed in them. There is a hand written letter signed by Ed Pink, responding to Bob’s inquiry about some engine work on the GTO.  Original owner’s manual and warranty book with the protect o plate. The original M20 transmission is included.  It currently has a M22 and the required scatter shield.  Posi-traction rear end with 4:11 gears.  Original interior. No one has ever sat in the back seat except 2 kids, once, by the previous owner. Bob red-lighted at the start of the 1970 Winternationals and that was it for “THE OLD GOAT”. He was so frustrated, he quit drag racing and parked the car in his hanger where it sat for 21 years and he refused to sell it. He finally called the 2nd owner, and he bought it and owned it for 28 years. He was a body and paint guy in Lompoc and repainted the car to the original color. The paint job is show quality.  Original spare, jack and jacking instructions on the “trunk sticker” is still there. Everything works! Included with the car are the original M & H drag slicks (still hold air and no checking on the sidewalls).  Also included are tons of 35MM slides and 8mm movies, original factory repair manual,  Book signed by GTO Guy Pete McCarthy..

A restoration was started but never completed the engine runs good and the transmission shifts good, the rear end is in good shape as well. The car has power brakes and power steering. The paint is in good shape but it is not a show car by any means most of the interior is with the car the seats and carpet are in good shape the door panels are in good shape as is the headliner although a new one is included. It has probably been driven less than 30 miles in the last 25 years. The trim tag is missing but the VIN shows it as a 68 charger R/T with a 440 375 hp engine. All the body panels are original except the quarter panels and they were replaced with panels from Year One. The floor pans and trunk are in good shape there is a couple of small spots that looked to have been patched many years ago. I am a friend of the family and am posting this for them I can send as many pictures as you want of this car. I will be glad to get it up in the air and take pictures of the undercarriage as well. Again this is not a show car it does need to be finished with some work it would be a solid driver but if your looking for a Mecum car or perfection this is not for you. They are negotiable on the price but within reason.  Thank you \n"}

I have driven it long distances (60 miles round-trip) and even on the highway with no issues. It’s only an 18 HP engine so it’s not quick, but it’ll get up to 60 mph with some time and a downhill grade helps. This little car gets attention everywhere you go and is so much fun to drive. It has a Clean Colorado Title and No accidents. Exact mileage is unknown but the odometer currently reads 2240.\nThe paint is shiny and looks good but up close in a couple areas it does have some signs of aging or scratches (see photos). There is one spot under the front hood, where the battery is at, that has signs of a small rusted out area (see photos). The left rear chrome nudge bar just broke the other day when I lifted, with my hands, the car up from it (stupid on my part). You can usually find on a few Fiat websites a nice used set (left and right) for $100 shipped or just the left piece new for about $80. Parts are pretty inexpensive to purchase for this car, you just have to wait for shipping from Italy/Europe. No other signs of rusted areas are visible or known to the owner. The rear sometimes leaks a couple drops of fluid after a drive. The oil level is always good on the oil stick and it's only been about 500 miles since the oil was changed. This is the only mechanical issue I didn't dive into and fix. Other than that, the car runs and drives great.\n- 4 Speed Manual\n- Rear Wheel Drive\n- Sunroof\n- About 40 mpg\n- New Wheels and Tires (about 200 miles)\n- I had the following work done by a Classic Fiat mechanic when I received the car: rebuild carburetor and jetted for Denver CO altitude, new gaskets, adjust valves, adjust timing, new points, new condenser, new spark plug cables set, new spark plugs, new ignition coil, new starter, replaced tranny boots, transmission fluid flush, oil change\n \nApproximate Vehicle size:\n- Length: 10 ft\n- Width: 4.3 ft\n- Ground Clearance: 5 in\n"}

Asides from things like setting ring gear, rebuild of the engines and transmissions, I did all the work myself.

I have recently completed a lot of work and it is running great except for some rust issues over the doors I was addressing but have not completed. You will need to complete the body work and some odds and ends here and there. The only real issue I have ever had was this car likes to eat IAC motors for some reason. It may be an problem with the wiring harness but have never got so far to figure it out. Another nuisance is the A/C only works on Max Cold as the blend door motor was stuck on heat so I unplugged it and “persuaded” it to remain on cold. This can be fixed if you decide to dissect the dash board as the engineers started with the actuator and then built the car around it. Overall I have always strived to keep it OE with the only exception being the test pipes temporary installed to diagnose an exhaust back pressure issue.\n \nAs I do work out of state, I will arrange to meet the buyer at my home for the transaction.

But for most there is only enough garage and budget space for one. So, which do you choose? Do you go for a brand-new showroom fresh model for nearly 200K? Or do you keep it old school and go for a classic Corvette?  There are some compelling reasons why getting a classic Corvette is the way to go, and why 1963 is a special year.\nThis C2 classic has a completely new black vinyl upholstery and carpet package. It is powered by a 327ci V8 paired with new exhaust and optional four-speed Posi-traction manual transmission. Optional equipment includes a new white convertible soft top and also a freshly painted pearl white hardtop, 15″ rally wheels, power assist brakes, a telescopic steering column, a push-button AM/FM radio, LED headlights and new auto glass.\nOriginal rally wheels are mounted with new 215-60R15 Kelly “Charger” tires. The C2 was the first Corvette to offer fully independent suspension, with upper and lower control arms at the front and a three-link setup with a transverse leaf spring at the rear.\nThe three-spoke steering wheel is mounted on a telescopic column and frames a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, amperage, oil pressure, and water temperature. The five-digit odometer shows approximately 47k original miles, over 1000 of which were added under current ownership. The refurbished 327ci V8 engine is equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and finned aluminum valve covers. The restoration also includes a new electronic windshield wiper system and a new parking/emergency brake being installed by Rollings Automotive (our favorite Corvette shop).\n"}

It arrived to me in August after shipping delays. The document package included all maintenance records and Heritage Certificate from original owner. I was assured by the E&R representative that it was a good solid car and all systems were working fine and it was ready to drive. But as it goes with on-line purchases, there are always issues to be resolved. The first drive proved that all systems were working fine, all gages working, good oil pressure, good brakes and no unusual sounds. However, there were issues to get the car to where I feel confident to take it on the road. The project entailed being a serious MOSS MOTORS customer. I replaced the wiring harness with a new fabric cover system. Also replaced battery cables, new dash switches, solenoid, voltage regulator and a battery cutoff switch. Converted to negative ground and replaced tach with proper negative ground type. Externally I replaced grill (the previous owner had painted the vertical bars). The shiny grill made the bumpers look dull, so I replaced front and rear bumpers and overriders. Added auxiliary hood release. Replaced exhaust with stainless steel system. Replaced weatherstripping on doors and hatch along with window channels, vent window seals, rider and driver window glass (had scratches on originals) and rebuilt regulators. Replaced both windshield wheel box assemblies along with new wiper arms and blades. Sand blasted, primed and painted all five wire wheels. Replaced front rotors and pads. In the interior, I added sound deadening on floors and replaced all carpeting. The seats were rebuilt with new diaphragms, new foam and black leather with red piping. Same for rear seat. For the engine compartment, I added aluminum radiator, replaced fan and hub, replaced all hoses, clamps and grommets for water, oil and fuel. Replaced heater control valve and all control cables. All removeable pieces were sandblasted, primed and painted with all new hardware. \nIt was a busy year getting this MGB GT ready. I am retired and enjoy working an cars and getting them to a point where I feel confident and proud to drive them. In my early years I had a blue 67, a primrose 71 and a damask 74. I ordered it early after seeing the pictures of the new rubber bumper model, so I was able to get chrome bumpers. All were GT models as I like the style. That followed with muscle cars, street rods and classics. My problem now is I had recent back surgery which limits my ability to do these projects so I must sell. I am located in Central Virginia and the car is always kept in a conditioned garage. I have documentation of all work that I have done as well as manuals and various leftover parts that I purchased while doing the work. While this is not a Concourse grade car, it is a quality dependable car for taking to local shows and fun drives.\n"}

They are shared with the high-performance Corvette Z06 and feature 14-inch front and 13.4-inch rear cross-drilled rotors gripped by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers.  The Grand Sport uses a suspension setup similar to the Z06’s, as well as wider alloy wheels and tires — 9.5 inches in front and 12 inches in back.\nUnder the hood is the original LS3 V8, rated at 436 horsepower at 5,900 rpm and 424 lb-ft of torque at 4,600 rpm when new. Maintaining the smooth power band of the 6.2-liter engine is easy thanks to the efficient paddle-shifted six-speed automatic transmission. Reviews from its launch state that the car could reach 60 mph in 4 seconds, with a top speed of 190 mph.\nEXTERIOR\nThis Grand Sport is covered in brilliant Torch Red. The paint is flawless with a clay bar smooth finish. The Grand Sport option is noted on chrome inserts above the vents just behind the front wheels.  A tasteful body colored rear spoiler was professionally installed in addition to several interior and exterior carbon fiber-look accents ($5000).  The engine compartment is stock and pristine. The car includes the optional glass top. All the glass is in excellent shape with a professional tint applied and the doors seal tightly with no wind noise or leaks.\nINTERIOR\nThe Light Cashmere leather interior is in “like new” condition and thanks to the 2LT Preferred Equipment Group option features a few more bells and whistles than a standard model. These options include heated sport memory seats with power bolsters and lumbar support and a premium nine-speaker Bose radio that accepts CDs and offers Bluetooth connectivity. All the gauges, heads-up display, dual-zone climate control, and control switches and accessories function properly.\nCHASSIS\nThe Grand Sport option features a wider track (with wide-body styling), revised shocks, stiffer springs, and firmer stabilizer bars to provide even better handling than base model Corvettes. Original chrome wheels holding Nitto Invo tires.  Optional dual-mode performance exhaust ($1195) adds an extra 6 hp.  The Grand Sport’s brakes are particularly well executed. They’re shared with the high-performance Corvette Z06 and feature 14-inch front and 13.4-inch rear cross-drilled rotors gripped by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers.  The Grand Sport uses a suspension setup similar to the Z06’s, as well as wider alloy wheels and tires — 9.5 inches in front and 12 inches in back\nDOCUMENTATION\nThe seller states that this vehicle will be sold on a clean Texas title in his name. This 2010 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport Coupe was purchased when only 3 months old with 6000 miles and has remained in current owner’s possession ever since. Since then, the car has only been used for pleasure driving. The sale will include all factory manuals and custom cover. The owner admits to not driving the car as often as he should and would prefer to see this Grand Sport ‘Vette being enjoyed on the road instead of sitting in his garage.\n"}

One too many hotrods, forced to sell this beautiful ride. Safeties/certified.  Not a numbers matching car, original engine L22 - 250 cu in has been upgraded to a high HP 350 cu in engine. Car is tight; braking, suspension, steering, strong engine, strong transmission with no body or suspension squeaks anywhere while driving. Drives like new! No accidents, all seams excellent, correct from the factory.\nWith 20 years of storage this car needed some love and care. I purchased the car because it has a sound frame, undercarriage and had no rust on the body. Mechanicals, worn components, worn rubber and paint clear coat peel can all be addressed, a rotten frame or body cannot. I have owned 10 previous classic cars. Therefore, I know what to look for in a solid classic car. I had a vision of what this car could be and believe the Z28 accents add value to the look of the car. I targeted a black on orange contrast. You be the judge! The following has been done in the last 8 months by me and my selected automotive partners:\n\nThis is a 45k mile car. Original interior, sheet metal all solid outside and inside (all metal car), Underbody excellent, Frame excellent, original wheel wells, doors, fenders, rocker panels, rear frame rails, no rust anywhere, strong 350 cu in/ transmission. All gauges, lights, turn signals functioning as they should (including clock!). A true 45K mile car. Note: MPH on Speedo, this is a US car in origin (If a Canadian car it would be in Kilometers). This car somehow at sometime made its way up to Canada from the USA. Most likely a southern US car because of no rust on the body. Please see all photos and video with the ad. Let’s remind ourselves that GM’s quality in 1976 was not like it is today. This is a 47 year old car, thus the car comes with its quirks and quality from the factory. \n\nFraser MacDuffee\n"}

He wanted the nicest, most unique, jaw-dropping Cadillac on the road, and money was no object. It needed to be a '59 Caddy convertible, so I found him the nicest fully restored 1959 Cadillac I could find. He then took it to one of the best custom shops in town and had it equipped with the top-of-the-line computerized air ride system, custom-ordered 22” polished billet Colorado Custom wheels that were created to match the style of the original Cadillac hubcaps, wrapped with custom 22-inch whitewall tires. They finished it off with a completely hidden, insane sound system. The tasteful modifications were done to keep the car's original look but give it a modern twist. The result is a stunning boulevard cruiser that no exotic can match!\nThis was a solid, rust-free car from the start that was completely restored from front to back. Finished in beautiful Seminole Red with all show-quality chrome and trim. Even the entire front and rear billet grilles were completely taken apart and restored. The sides are straight as an arrow with excellent fit and finish. The interior was completely redone in correct red and white and looks amazing against the matching red paint finish. All the chrome inside the car is beautiful, with a perfect dash and fully restored steering wheel and a perfect horn ring. Inside the trunk, it was finished wonderfully in matching red as well. It has a new white soft top with a matching top boot. It just doesn't get any better than this. When he built this car the way he wanted it, he did it with preservation in mind and kept all the original parts to put the car right back to stock if you ever decide to do so.\nThis is just an awesome cruiser that is so much fun to drive. Drop the top, throw your favorite tunes on from your phone, pick up your friends, and have the time of your life cruising this baby on the weekends.

The truck was repainted green and fitted with a rebuilt 2.25-liter diesel engine as part of a refurbishment completed in Spain in 2018. It is said to have been subsequently imported to the US and was purchased by the prior owner in 2019. Equipment includes a four-speed transmission, a dual-range transfer case, 16″ steel wheels, disc brakes, a tan removable soft top, and seating for six.\nThe truck was refinished in green during the refurbishment and features a tan removable soft top with roll-up sides as well as a split windshield, sliding side windows, dual fender-mounted mirrors, and a galvanized front bumper, door hinges, and hood hinges.\nBody-color 16″ steel wheels wear 205/80 Insa Turbo Special Track-2 tires, and a spare steel wheel with a matching tire is stored against the bulkhead in the rear cargo area. Braking is handled by discs at all four corners.\nThe cab features bucket seats upholstered in black vinyl along with color-coordinated door panels and all-weather floor mats. Equipment includes cowl vents, a center console, two cup holders, and push-button operation for the glow plugs and ignition. A metal bulkhead separates the cab from the cargo area.\nThe banjo-style steering wheel fronts a body-color dashboard housing a Veglia-Bressel 120-km/h speedometer and a Smiths combination gauge for coolant temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 84k kilometers (~52k miles), and true mileage is unknown.\nThe cargo area features four fold-away jump seats, two storage compartments, and an all-weather floor liner.\nThe 2.25-liter diesel inline-four was reportedly rebuilt in 2018. Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case.

This 12C Spider has Vorsteiner (LOOK IT UP!) carbon fiber accents throughout the car - rear spoiler/wing, side skirts, vents, CLEAR PROTECTIVE WRAP, incredible stereo w/ nav, and more. A mid-mounted V8 engine that now makes over 615 horsepower is at the heart of the McLaren’s enviable performance figures, while a supple 2-seat interior and a surprisingly refined ride help make this quarter-million-dollar car more livable than others in its rarified air. Low miles, immaculately taken care of, never has been on a track, and serviced at an authorized McLaren dealer since purchased new.  Read the following to understand why this listing is a screaming buy, beautiful car, and the reason I've owned it for five years vs. getting something else!  \nDriving The Used 2013 McLaren MP4-12C\nEven with all its power and performance abilities, the MP4-12C can be a tame beast when you want it to be. It’s a supercar that won’t fuss about trips to the market. In \"normal\" mode, the chassis quells rough roads with ease. Switch to \"sport\" or \"track\" settings, though, and the McLaren becomes another car. Suddenly, its compliant ride and smooth shifts from the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission are replaced by a ferocity that leaves no doubt about the racecars that inspired the 12C. Turbo lag from the compact V8 engine is nearly nonexistent. The McLaren 12C spider has a 0-60 mph time of 3.10 seconds. The MP4 corners with devastating precision and makes even novice drivers look good thanks to a system that applies brakes when needed to help keep you – and the car – in one piece.\nInterior Comfort\nGetting into the McLaren via the upward-opening doors are a nice touch since it allows you to sit on the doorsill before settling into the low designed drivers seat. Once inside, though, the car is quite comfortable. The two seats are appropriately bolstered, and to McLaren’s credit there is even cargo space on a bench behind the seats in addition to the cavity up front near the bumper (remember, this is a mid-engine car). Directly in front of the driver is the large oval instrumentation that will let you know when you’re traveling at jail speeds. This Spider model feature a rear glass panel that can be lowered to let in more engine noise in the cabin along with fresh air when the top is up.\nExterior Styling\nThe McLaren has more curves than a supermodel and skin as scintillating as one. Massive air intakes define the MP4’s sides, while even the vertical-opening doors are a work of design magic. Up front, long and trapezoidal headlights are reminiscent of Ferraris, and the rear boasts high-mounted exhausts that howl from above, not below, the bumper. The McLaren’s mid-mounted V8 heart, meanwhile, is displayed under a panel of glass for all to see. Spider models have a 2-piece retractable hardtop and dual-purpose tonneau that protects the retracted roof or, with the roof up, covers a small cargo space.\nMy Favorite Features\nLUXURY RIDE QUALITY\nFOLDING HARD TOP\nStandard Features\nThe \nFactory Options\nThe McLaren can be taken to even higher heights with carbon-ceramic brakes (nearly $14,000 alone), power-adjustable seats, parking sensors, custom interior trims including Alcantara, an upgraded audio system with satellite navigation, and exterior bits that include carbon-fiber engine panels. An upgraded exhaust system that’s lighter and louder than the standard one can be had for even more aural pleasure. A \"Stealth Pack\" doesn’t make the car invisible, but rather finishes the rear airbrake and exhaust pipe in a polished metallic finish, with the aim of giving the 12C a more aggressive rear.\nEngine & Transmission\nThe heart of every McLaren MP4-12C is a twin-turbo V8 engine that has now been tuned to make \nCar is located in Auburn AL (30 min. from Columbus GA).  Has been garaged and has only been in rain twice!   \nVIN# SBM11BSS4DW002008 WITH CLEAN TITLE IN HAND!  No trades, no test drives without proof of funds (current bank letter of credit, 3rd party financials, or current bank statement.   Thanks!\n"}

This car is more than just a vehicle, it's a piece of history, a testament to the golden age of automotive design. It's not just a car, it's a lifestyle, a statement, a symbol of elegance and sophistication.\nThis beautiful machine has been lovingly cared for by three owners, all of whom have kept it safely tucked away in a garage, preserving its charm and character. It has a new exhaust system including new chrome pipes. Its sleek silver exterior, a $5,000.00 recent paint job addition, gleams like a moonbeam, turning heads wherever it goes.\nUnder the hood, the engine purrs like a well-fed cat, with a compression of 150 psi in five of the six cylinders and 145 psi in the remaining one. The tires, though not brand new, still have plenty of life left in them, with 5/32 tread on the front from 2000 and 8/32 on the rear from 2005.\nThe brake pads and rotors are in good condition, ensuring a smooth and safe ride. However, like any classic car, it has its quirks. There are small oil leaks, some radiator corrosion, and the idler arm bushing shows some wear.\nThe interior is a sight to behold, with excellent leather seats that cradle you in comfort. The back of the driver seat is coming loose, but it's a minor issue that should be easy to fix. The front passenger carpet shows fraying. The odometer is inoperable, showing 2050 miles, but we believe it has likely rolled over to 102,050 miles.\nThe car runs beautifully, but does experience some stalling when coming to a stop, which we suspect may be a fuel pump issue. Despite these minor issues, this car is a gem, a true classic that will bring joy to any car enthusiast.\nThis car comes with a treasure trove of original documents, including the maintenance manual from the first owner, the original Mercedes-Benz dealer's book from October 15, 1971, the maintenance booklet, the owner's manual, and the Mercedes-Benz 1970 catalog.\nThis car is being sold on behalf of a dear friend who unfortunately passed away in a motorcycle accident. His widow has made the difficult decision to part with this beautiful machine. This is a unique opportunity to own a piece of automotive history, and to continue the legacy of care and love that this car has always known.\nThis 1972 Mercedes 280 SE is more than just a car. It's a statement, a lifestyle, a piece of history and would be considered in between excellent and good condition. It's waiting for the right person to write the next chapter of its story. Could that person be you?\n"}

This example was produced on May 6th, 1960 in St. Louis, MO. It was ordered with a Horizon Blue and Ermine White coves exterior, white soft top and a Blue interior.

It was primary used as an occasional driver and show car. The exterior appearance is simply stunning with its stylish design and beautiful color combination. The body is very straight with excellent gap lines throughout. It was re-finished its original factory correct color of Horizon Blue with Ermine White coves. The ocean deep paint was recently detailed to a brilliant shine. It was outfitted with a brand new white soft top that was stamped with April 1960 date. The front windshield and door glass is new with stamps.

THANK YOU.\nhttps://bringatrailer.com/listing/1987-porsche-911-turbo-coupe-34/\nThis amazing and fully documented 1987 Porsche 911 Turbo with 31,000 original miles is a great example of a highly collectable European Sports Car. This car is a documented two owner vehicle with a clean Car Fax report. The 930 Turbo 3.3L was produced from 1978-1989 totaling 18,770 units worldwide. For the 1978 model year, Porsche revised the 930 with a larger 3.3-liter turbocharged engine with intercooler rated at 282hp. To fit the intercooler a newly designed “tea-tray” tail spoiler replaced the earlier whale tail spoiler. Porsche dropped the “Carrera” nomenclature for the North American markets and the car was simply called the Porsche 911 Turbo worldwide. The larger engine helped reduce some of the turbo lag inherent in the earlier models. As the original factory window sticker documents this example was ordered and shipped to Ogner Motorcars, Inc. located in Woodland Hills, CA. It was ordered with a Silver Metallic exterior and Black leather interior. It was also ordered with an electric sunroof and limited slip differential. As the original “Motor Vehicle Purchase Order”, original “Odometer Statement” and original “Due Bill” document it was purchased on July 7th, 1987 by Robert Faust who lived in Sherman Oaks, CA. A receipt of payment made in full was issued on July 20th, 1987. Robert was an excellent caretaker and always maintained the car properly which is documented with 16 service invoices from 1987-2007. Robert moved to New Mexico in July of 2006 which is indicated on the original New Mexico title. On March 2, 2007 Robert decided to sell the car with 26,081 original miles to Willhoit Enterprises which was a used automotive dealership located in Springfield, MO. This is also documented on the original New Mexico title. On March 20th, 2007 the car was sold to Michael Foley who lives in Bristol, RI which is documented with the original “Retail Buyers Order”. On April 22, 2007 Michael sent the car to Musante Motorsprorts located in South Windsor, CT for a complete service. Musante Motorsports is well-known and respected in the Porsche community. Musante Motorsports suggested an engine out service which is extensive. Some of the service also included some upgraded parts. As the service invoices document Michael invested a total of $30,291.75 in parts and labor which he didn’t mind because he was going to keep the car along time. He had the car dyno tested and as the dyno sheet documents it put down 375hp at the rear tires! Michael was also an excellent caretaker and always maintained the car properly. During the next 16 years Michael only used the car on special occasions averaging roughly 300 miles per year. It was stored in his garage on a car lift and was covered with a battery tender. During his time of ownership he found the original owner Robert Faust’s wallet under the seat. The wallet contained his license, 1 Admirals Club card, 3 credit cards, 2 California registrations and 3 insurance cards. Michael tried reaching out to Rober to return the wallet and learned Robert had passed. Michael kept the wallet and everything in it which is included. Michael is now retired and in his 70’s. He and his wife are moving down south closer to family so he decided to sell the car. Michael contacted MS CLASSIC CARS about purchasing the vehicle before listing it for sale. MS CLASSIC CARS jumped on the opportunity and purchased the car in September of 2023.\n"}

THANK YOU.**\n \nBarrett Jackson Description\n \nThis magnificent 1970 Mercury Cyclone GT is one of only 73 built with the 429 Super Cobra Jet V8 Drag Pak. The Super Cobra Jet 429-4V V8 was the street version of the Boss 429 racing engine as stated in the original factory Mercury dealership brochure that’s included. It is fully documented with the original Ford (Lois Eminger) Invoice and Elite Marti Report both of which are included. This example was the product of a high level rotisserie restoration with great attention to detail. This vehicle’s order type was an “A Plan Vehicle” which meant it was ordered by an employee of Ford or the selling dealership which in this case was Sesi Lincoln Mercury located in Ypsilanti, MI. It was ordered on September 23, 1969 as a 1970 Mercury Cyclone GT 2-door hardtop with a Competition Yellow exterior and Black Comfortweave Vinyl Hi-Back Bucket Seats interior. It was also ordered with the following options: complete tinted glass, Goodyear G78x14 belted white sidewall tires, courtesy lights, tachometer instrumentation group, electric clock, AM radio, dual rear seat speakers, rear window defogger, power front disc brakes, 429 Super Cobra Jet V8 Drag Pak, four-speed close ratio manual transmission and 3.91 Traction-Lok rear axle. It was built on November 18th, 1969 and sold on November 20th, 1969. From the information gathered this car only had 15,000 original miles prior to the nut and bolt rotisserie restoration which was completed in 2020. The previous and current title states actual mileage. The exterior of this car is in absolutely gorgeous condition throughout. The body is laser straight with great panel fitment. The car was re-finished in its original color of Competition Yellow paint. The high quality paint was recently detailed to a brilliant show quality shine. The Ram Air induction hood, dual racing mirrors, concealed headlights, black lower body-side painted and Cyclone GT 429 emblems scream muscle car. The front windshield was replaced new and all the remaining factory original stamped glass is in beautiful condition. It sits on new 15” Magnum 500 wheels and B.F. Goodrich Radial TA staggered tires that were added in 2023. A set of the original 14”wheels with factory hub caps and B.F. Goodrich Silvertown G78-14 whitewall tires are included. The black comfortweave vinyl interior is mostly original and truly remarkable. The Hi-back bucket seats are still firm and the seat belts still retain all the original date coded tags. The rim-blow sport steering wheel is in front of the 140-mph speedometer. The 8000-rpm tachometer, oil pressure, engine temperature and ammeter gauges are recessed individually into the dash. The painted trunk compartment has a factory style trunk mat, matching spare tire and jack tools. The engine compartment is highly detailed with many correct parts throughout. The car is powered by the original matching numbers 429 Super Cobra Jet V8 engine that was factory rated at 375HP. The decision was made during the rebuild to use higher performance parts for better reliability and increased horsepower. The engine was bored .80 over and stroked to a 533ci. Some of the internals parts include a #4340 forged steel crank, Comp Cam solid roller cam with custom grind, H Beam rods, Auto Tec forged pistons and Comp Cam Pro Magnum roller rockers. It has the factory intake and Holley carburetor #D00F-9210-N. The engine dyno tested with 527 horsepower and 599 Ft-Lbs. of torque. The engine breathes through the factory manifolds and correct style reproduction dual exhaust system. The engine is coupled to original matching numbers 4-speed transmission with factory Hurst shifter. The power is transferred to the “Drag Pak” 3.91 Traction-Lok rear axle. The undercarriage is also highly detailed throughout with many correct parts. The floors were re-painted in the correct red oxide color.

Ford intended not just to produce a supercar that paid homage to its predecessor but to eclipse it with cutting-edge technology and performance. The development began in secret, under the code name \"Project Phoenix,\" spearheaded by a small group of Ford engineers and designers committed to recapturing the glory of the GT's heritage. Their efforts came to light in 2015 when Ford stunned the automotive world with the unveiling of the all-new GT at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. With a design that was aerodynamically sculpted for maximum efficiency and a nod to the original GT40, the new GT was a striking blend of history and futuristic vision.\n\nProduction of the second generation Ford GT started in December 2016, with a plan for a limited run, making it an exclusive supercar emphasizing performance and collectibility. It was outfitted with a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 engine, which was a departure from the traditional V8. Yet, it delivered a formidable 647 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque, further increased to 660 horsepower starting in the 2020 model year. This powerhouse was encased in a carbon fiber monocoque chassis, draped in a sleek, aerodynamically optimized body that paid homage to its ancestors while breaking ground with its efficiency and downforce generation. Ford utilized the most advanced materials and engineering techniques of the time, ensuring that the second-generation GT set a new benchmark for American supercars in terms of performance, technology, and design. With its active aerodynamics, pushrod suspension, and a top speed of over 200 miles per hour, the GT was not just a tribute to the past; it was a bold stride into the future of automotive excellence.\n\nThe 2021 Ford GT offered here presents in immaculate, like-new condition, showing a mere 29 miles on the odometer. Nearly $50,000 worth of desirable options further enhance this example's appeal, including the Dark Energy interior upgrade package, a comprehensive cabin overhaul that adds boundless carbon fiber and alluring black finishes. The leather-wrapped F1-inspired steering wheel, Sparco carbon fiber racing seats trimmed with black Alcantara, matte carbon instrument bezels, and anodized black aluminum shift paddles complete the dark, jet-fighter interior. Outside, the car is finished in Frozen White with optional Lightning Blue stripes, a livery that evokes Ford's racing history in an immediately recognizable fashion. Matching blue-painted Brembo brake calipers are mounted over ventilated and cross-drilled carbon ceramic rotors, appearing as jewels under the 20\" satin silver wheels. On the road or the track, the speed-activated splitter and deployable rear wing keep downforce high, while the push-button front lift system makes day-to-day navigation simple. Offered here with special permission from Ford, this example represents a rare opportunity to own a virtually brand-new GT.\n \nOptional Equipment\nModifications\nOwnership History & Provenance\nItems included in the Sale\n"}

Conceived in 2002, the development of this iconic sports car was spearheaded by Ford's then-Vice President of Design, J Mays. The design took inspiration from the historic Ford GT40, the legendary race car that achieved an impressive four consecutive wins at Le Mans from 1966 to 1969, defying Ferrari's dominance. The team aimed not just to echo the GT40's aesthetic appeal but to craft a modern supercar that could stir the souls of car enthusiasts and honor the original's legacy. By mid-2003, a concept version had been unveiled, stunning the public with its faithful yet fresh reinterpretation of the GT40's timeless design.\n\nManufacture of the first generation Ford GT commenced in 2004, with the first deliveries taking place the same year. The car was engineered to be a high-performance machine and a road-legal sports car, a dual character that required an exquisite balance of power, handling, and aerodynamics. It featured a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 engine, which produced an impressive 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Crafted with an aluminum body and equipped with a sophisticated suspension system, the GT was a showcase of Ford's advanced technology and commitment to driving excellence. Its production, however, was limited; over two years, only around 4,000 units were built, making it an instant classic. The GT's blend of performance and exclusivity solidified its place in the pantheon of great American sports cars.\n\nThe 2006 Ford GT offered here shows just over 3,700 miles on the clock and has remained with one owner since new; its exceptional condition is a testament to the owner's meticulous care. It is finished in Centennial White with optional blue racing stripes over an Ebony leather interior, perhaps the most iconic and well-known GT combination. Outside, the optional lightweight forged aluminum wheels are complemented by gray-painted brake calipers mounted over the massive ventilated and cross-drilled rotors. Inside the sleek, rocket ship interior, bolstered sport seats trimmed in Ebony leather ensure the occupants stay firmly put even at breakneck speeds while the optional McIntosh sound system provides entertainment. Rarely does a first-generation example of this caliber present itself, and this example checks every box for the discerning collector.\n \nOptional Equipment:\nService Records\nOwnership History & Provenance\nItems included in the Sale\n"}

It was so good looking that all of his friends wanted one which pushed him to move it into production. Fast-forwarding to 1958, Lincoln made a bold move in switching to unitary construction for the 1958 models, but the result was somewhat underwhelming. The largest Lincolns to date and the hugest unibody cars ever, they came across as massive and interesting, competitive at first but pretty dated by 1960. The new, clean design for 1961 started out as a Thunderbird concept and so it was created around a Thunderbird cowl. But it was Robert McNamara, Ford general manager and future company president, who suggested it become a four-door Lincoln Continental. This caused quite a stir, since an evolutionary Lincoln, based on the 1958-60 design, was already in process. But Engel's design prevailed, and went into production in November 1960.\nThe Industrial Design Institute awarded it a coveted Bronze Medal which is very difficult to achieve for an automobile. 15 inches shorter than its predecessor, the new Continental was designed for ease of passenger entry: the lack of a wrap-around windshield and use of  \"suicide\" rear doors aided in this. And truly modern for the time was a four-door convertible body style.\nOffered here\n"}

The car is painted in the factory color code S (Medium Gold Metallic), and the interior has been changed from the original Nugget-colored interior to a cloth animal print. This Continental comes with power seats, locks, windows, and the trademark suicide rear-hinged doors. The car's odometer shows 39,260 miles, but the total mileage is unknown. This Lincoln is currently located in Chicago, Illinois.\nThe third-party photos of the car show a straight body with clean lines. The car does show some rust on the lower left rear quarter panel and front bumper, and surface rust is present underneath the vehicle. There is also a paint defect on the right fender, and the photos show a cracked fan shroud. A third-party inspection of the car was performed and found that the interior is in good condition despite a tear in the headliner. The inspection also notes that the tire tread depth should also be monitored. All power features in the interior are said to be functioning properly. A video of the engine running smoothly is included in the report. Overall the car is a good candidate for some exterior reconditioning or for the next owner to enjoy as it is. Included in the sale are two sets of keys. \nThis Lincoln Continental is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Chicago, IL.\nFinancing options are available through our recommended lenders.

The fourth-generation Continental is one of Lincoln's most well-known cars, featuring prominently in pop culture. Lincoln consolidated their model lineup in 1961, making the Continental their only model. The fourth-generation Continentals were available as sedans, coupes, or four-door convertibles and were fitted with a range of V8 engines. Production of the fourth-generation Continental lasted until 1969 when it was replaced by the Fifth Generation Lincoln Continental.\nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n"}

Beginning production in 1953 with the iconic 100-4, Austin Healeys 4 cylinder model which proved to be extremely popular for both road and racing purposes. After a while Donald Healey just couldn't squeeze any more power out of his trusty Austin 4 cylinder so he upgraded to a straight six cylinder overhead valve Austin unit with twin SU H6 carburetors producing 130 horsepower, a huge upgrade from the previous 4 cylinder engine. The 100-6 proved to be extremely popular becoming the basis for the iconic 3000 to follow. The 3000 proved to be even more popular and much more refined than its predecessors. The overhead valve six was upgraded yet again now 3 liters versus the 2.6 liter engine in the 100-6. he most refined version and arguably the best came in 1965 with the BJ8 MKIII. These had 150 horsepower over the previous 136 horsepower in the MKII with a bore size of 2 inches and a higher lift camshaft. These also had a wood grained dash board, a 4 speed transmission with overdrive and roll up windows. These were the best road going Healeys.\nOffered here is one of these great BJ8 MKIII’s that is a very solid original car that is well sorted and is rust free. Finished in red with black coves, this late 3000 is really sharp. Everything works as it should including the overdrive. It has recently been treated to a mechanical service with a new clutch, throwout bearing and rear main seal. It runs and drives incredibly well and is fitted with aa stainless steel exhaust that gives an incredible tone. If you are looking for a great, well sorted BJ8 MKIII than this car should certainly be considered.\n"}

The name was used for the top models in Ford's full-size range from 1958 until 1961, in a marketing attempt to appeal to the excitement surrounding the Space Race. In 1958, a concept car was introduced called \"la Galaxie\" which incorporated the headlights into pods in line with the grille and a reduced front profile. The 1963 model was essentially unchanged save for some freshening and added trim; windshields were reshaped, and a four-door hardtop 500/XL was added. A lower, fastback roofline was added mid-year to improve looks and make the big cars more competitive on the NASCAR tracks with less drag and reduced aerodynamic lift at high speed. Very few of these automobile icons are still on the road. Fewer still are the number of road-worthy units in such fantastic condition as this one!

The first generation of Corvair was a series of compact, rear-engined cars available in sedan, coupe, convertible, and station wagon body styles. These cars were initially powered by an air-cooled, 2.3L flat-six engine, but over the course of production, displacement grew to 2.4L (1961-1963), before finally reaching 2.7L for the 1964 model year. In 1961, Chevrolet introduced a van and pickup based on the Corvair. These utilitarian vans and pickups are collectively known as the Corvair 95 (95-inch wheelbase), with the van known as the Chevrolet Greenbrier, and the pickup featuring in the Corvair Pickup market. Production of the first-generation Corvair continued until 1964 when it was replaced by the Second Generation Chevrolet Corvair.\n \nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nOwnership History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n"}

The diminutive sedan weighed just 1,100 lbs and was powered by a 479cc, 2-cylinder, air-cooled engine producing 13 horsepower (with later models increasing output to 17 horsepower). The 500 was an instant success and would see few updates throughout its nearly 20-year production run, over which time almost 4 million vehicles were sold.

The official records show that it raced only twice with a finishing place of 18th at the 1978 30th annual Payless Super Markets Little 500 and a 23rd place finish at the 1980 32nd annual Payless Super Markets Little 500.\nWhat drew Ray Evernham to this car was its iconic “in-period” shape and setup that included a Stu Hillborn fuel-injected V-8 engine with magneto ignition and Brodix free-flow racing cylinder heads. The stance is typical dirt track with its staggered and offset wheel and tire combination featuring large M&H tires in the rear and grooved Goodyear front tires mounted on Halibrand magnesium wheels with tri-prong knock-offs.\nDuring this era of racing, the short, oval, dirt tracks were the stepping stone for a professional ride at the large, oval, speedway tracks like the prestigious Indianapolis Raceway. All of the greatest drivers of the Indianapolis Brickyard—including A.J. Foyt, Al Unser, Bobby Unser, Wally Dallenbach, Mario Andretti, Lloyd Rudy, Pancho Carter, Johnny Rutherford and more—“cut their teeth” and “made their bones” driving sprint cars in the short bullrings of Eldora, El Centro, Redding and Indianapolis Park. What made these sprint cars such lethal weapons was their immense horsepower relative to their light weight, all of which was contained within in a very short wheelbase. Driving an open-wheeled Sprint car sideways in close contact with one another separated the men from the boys in this form of racing.\nEngine last ran on Dyno in 2012 and was put in proper storage. Engine is fresh/ 0 hours ready to run.\nWorldwide shipping available, please email me for a Quote.\n"}

From its nicely cared for factory interior to its captivating exterior, this Corvette exudes timeless beauty and offers an exhilarating driving experience.\nThis documented 1967 Corvette comes in its original Goodwood green shade, accentuated by striking white stinger stripes - a combination that epitomizes the allure of mid-year Corvettes.

Notably, it features a date code correct 427/435 HP engine, ensuring authenticity and performance.\nStep inside, and you'll be greeted by a beautifully restored green interior. The upholstery exudes luxury and comfort, complemented by brand new carpets and restored gauges, which appear crisp and vibrant behind crystal-clear lenses.

With a robust cam inside, the engine emits an authoritative rumble and delivers exhilarating performance. The engine bay showcases proper detailing, though the paint exhibits signs of aging, giving the car a character that encourages occasional drives to let its 435 horses stretch their legs. Recent servicing of the 4-speed transmission and rear end, along with power brakes, ensures an effortless and enjoyable driving experience. Completing the package are the factory-style wheels, adding an extra touch of authenticity.\nTo underscore the car's pedigree and condition, it was personally inspected by renowned Corvette expert Roy Sinor in January of this year (report available upon request). With every aspect nicely sorted and attended to, this Corvette is ready to hit the road and be enjoyed to the fullest. Its mere presence commands respect, and its performance never fails to impress.\nWhile a factory-original, matching-numbers 427/435 Corvette commands a substantial premium in today's market, this custom crafted tribute car presents a unique opportunity. Priced at a fraction of its counterpart, it offers the chance to own a remarkable piece of automotive history without compromising on performance or driving pleasure.\nDon't miss your chance to own this exceptional 1967 Chevrolet Corvette 427/435 tribute car.

And the Bugeye (Frogeye in Britain) was very poplar because it had unique styling, exciting performance, and reliability (first three places in its class in the 1959 12-hour race at Sebring).  It is, in short,  a true British sports car restored to an “as new” level.\nFor more information call us at 540-370-4474\n"}

Both on the street and on the track, it was and continues to be one of the most popular luxury sports cars on the market. The air-cooled 911, produced from 1964 to 1998, went through a number of engines and styles before a full redesign came with the 996 series.\n \nThe 1970 and 1971 Porsche 911s were fitted with a larger, 2.2 L engine rather than the previous generation’s 2.0 L engine that could be mated to either a four-speed 911/00 manual transmission or a five-speed 911/01 manual transmission. The displacement increase brought horsepower figures to 123 hp in the 911T, 153 hp in the 911E, and 180 hp in the top-of-the-line 911S. The T joined its brethren in receiving ventilated disc brakes, making all 911s so equipped. This generation of 911 saw safer external door handles, rubber-mounted dashboard gauges, a steering lock, as well as a US-only warning buzzer to let the driver know the keys were left in the ignition.\n \nFor the 1971 model year, only the 911E & S had fuel injection, while the entry-level 911T came standard with Zenith carburetors. This changed in 1972 when fuel injection became standard across all models due to US emissions regulations. All 1971 models did, however, come equipped with three-speed intermittent windshield wipers and crankcase oil squirters for improved piston cooling.\n \nThis generation continued offering the “Targa” version, which gave the car a “safer” open-air experience to appease the U.S. NHTSA regulations. Rather than a fully open-top convertible, the Targa was equipped with a stainless steel-clad roll bar, a removable roof panel, and a removable plastic rear window.\n \nThe collectability and value of Porsche 911s, in general, has been steadily increasing over the past decade or so. Even though the T was the starter 911 for this generation, the US-market cars can be more desirable than their international counterparts due to the slight increase in horsepower. The Targa versions are also the best of both worlds between a coupe and a convertible, offering both experiences without much compromise.\n \nThis particular example, Chassis # 9111110750, is a 1971 model fitted with the five-speed 911/01 manual transmission. According to the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, it was ordered with optional front and rear stabilizers, comfort equipment, tinted glass, Targa top, and light metal wheels. It was finished in a fairly unique warm shade of yellow that not many cars at the time wore called Gold Metallic. The interior was finished in contrasting Black Leatherette, a color scheme it wears to this day. Not much is known about this 911T’s history other than the fact that it is a numbers-matching example with a good, driver-quality restoration. The stock Zenith carburetors were also upgraded to Webers, giving the car an upgraded and more reliable driving experience.\n \nWhen we received it on consignment in June of 2022, we had some servicing performed to get the car in proper running order. Autocar Bespoke, LLC in Philadelphia, PA, started things off with an exterior and brightwork detail before we entrusted Performance Automotive Inc. in Malvern, PA, in September of 2022 with a clutch service that included a clutch cable, clevis pin, and pivot pin. It returned to Performance Automotive Inc. in August of 2023 for a full transmission rebuild that included a clutch pedal shaft, synchro sleeve, synchro rings and teeth, gear teeth, differential bearings, and fresh fluids. They also addressed some fuel system issues that were rectified with a new fuel pressure regulator and a carburetor rebuild.\n \nAs it sits, this 1971 Porsche 911T is a numbers-matching, driver-level restored example that is ready for a new adventure. The optional Targa top makes this a perfect choice for any weather while adding a style choice that revolutionized the industry when it was released. Those looking for a classic, entry-level 911 to add to their collection or to kickstart their Porsche lineup would be pleased with what this one has to offer. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the service records on file, the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, and the original spare wheel.\n \nPlease visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

Both provided oral information and documentation. I was also able to contact\nTony Borroz, the son of owner number two, who provided additional insight into his father’s period of\nownership. The ownership time period of owner one and two may not be split exactly correctly, but is\nbelieved to be pretty close.\n‍\nThe Anecdotal Story goes like this: \n‍\n‍\ncar or modify it in any way. I was unable to document his name.\n‍\nThe second owner Joe Borroz, moved to Vancouver, Washington in 1950 where he worked 30 years for Alcoa\nAluminum as a tool and die maker. Joe was in his late 40’s when he bought the car from owner number one.\nAccording to Joe’s son Tony, Joe did not believe the car should be modified, but rather maintained as stock.\nJoe regarded himself as the “Caretaker” of the Tiger, rather than the “Owner”. In 1995 Joe moved to Sierra\nVista, Arizona, taking the car with him. Again, a very mature second owner that also was not a hot rodder or\nauto-crosser.\n‍\nThe car was always a Sunday car, never a daily driver, which kept the mileage down. To this day the car only\nhas 95,000 miles, which is very low for a 60 year old car. It rains a lot in Oregon and Washington, which also\nprobably helped keep the mileage low.\n‍\nFourteen years later in August 2009 Jeff Kane bought the car and relocated it to the Bay Area. The car was\nvery complete and unmolested, retaining all the normal Tiger pieces that typically have been lost and\nreplaced. That’s why Jeff bought the car, as you rarely see unmolested Tigers. Because of its age and unusually\nlow mileage, Jeff commissioned Rootes Group Depot to totally restore and freshen the car. The suspension,\nbrakes, interior and under carriage were redone. The engine was not rebuilt but carb, generator, distributor\nand radiator were redone. It is very likely that a valve job was performed.\n‍\nJeff had another Personalized Tiger that he drove primarily, leaving #375 to sit more than is good for them.\nWhen Jeff passed away, I bought the car from Emily Vassos, his wife.\n \nThe Freshen Up:\n‍\nSince the car was in the Bay Area, as is Rootes Group, I asked Bill Martin what it would take to make the car\nexceptionally concours correct. At the time, Bill and other STOA members were using this car to write the\nconcours correct judging manual. Bill and I spent an entire afternoon going over the car with a microscope.\nWe filled 5 pages of a spiral bound notebook with small and not so small corrections to freshen and make\ncorrections. Bill spent 6 months blowing thru the list. The totality of the result was stunning. It was as if the car\nwas completely re-restored. After taking possession of the car, I did another 2 pages of “fixes”.\n‍\nThe First Showings:\n‍\nThe car was not finished when we took it to Tigers United 40 in 2019 held in Sacramento. CA. Unbelievably,\nthe car took first place in Stock Concour, and also won the Howie Award for Best Stock Tiger, and then won\nthe Peoples Choice Award.\n‍\nDue to Covid, the next possible outing was Suni VII, held in Indepence, MO in September 2021.\nThe Tiger easily placed First in the Stock Tiger class in the Concour Judging.\nRecently, the Tiger was shown at Tigers United 41 in Santa Maria, CA in June 2022. The Tiger won Stock\nConcour and for the second time won the prestigious Howie Award for best stock Tiger.\n‍\nWhy LUCKY:\n‍\nSo, to Unique and Accurate we have to add LUCKY. LUCKY, that the first two long term owners were very\nmature. LUCKY they were not hot rodders or auto-crossers. Lucky that they lived and cared for the car far\naway from the California scene, that destroyed so many cars. LUCKY, the car spent its whole life in favorable\nclimates. LUCKY, that in the car’s 60 year life, it has covered only 95,000 original miles.\n \nThe car runs and drives like a new Tiger with very tight suspension and steering. This Tiger runs exceptionally\ncool at both high and low speeds, and even stop and go. There are no oil leaks of any kind. Absolutely\neverything works properly, as noted in the Functions test at the two events attended.\n \nREFERENCES:\n‍\nAnyone interested in purchasing this car should very definitely discuss it with Bill Martin, who\nbuilt the car, and more importantly was and is, the Chief Arbiter of Correctness. The following Tiger Notables\nTom Hall and Patrick King are completely familiar and knowledgeable about this car and could be used as\nreferences. Of course, the car has been TAC’d and authenticated.\n \nPotential Spares:\n‍\nPotentially available spares not included in the purchase price are the following:\n"}

I sold it around 35 years ago to a friend and it was a 100% rust free car even before being restored.\nThe then owner wanted a clean look up front so the headlights were mounted behind the corner chrome louvers and a 1965 Riviera grill installed. It looks like a 1965 Riviera except the chrome louvers don't open.\nA new piston broke in the rebuilt 401 Nailhead after 500 miles and the engine was damaged and the Buick went into long time storage. I recently bought a 425 Nailhead from a 1965 Riviera that has been totally, completely rebuilt. Bored with new pistons and rings, crank turned, new cam, lifters, timing gears and chain, oil pump, redone heads with hardened valve seats etc. It was a $5000 plus rebuild.\nThe body of the Riviera is fantastic, never any rust. Mechanically it has been redone and rebuilt, the chrome is a mixture of rechrome and excellent original chrome. The interior was totally redone and it is fantastic also.\nNew tires, in my pictures the car has incorrect wide white wall tires, they have since been  replaced with skinnier white wall tires.\nNew exhaust, new alternator, new master cylinder and the complete brake system has been rebuilt, rebuilt carburetor, new water pump, new fuel pump, recored original radiator and on and on. The restoration cost around $65.000 and that was around 15 years ago .\nI don't think there's another restored 1964 Riviera in this condition for sale at even close to my inexpensive price! \nThe Riviera is in Phoenix, Arizona.

{"make": "Porsche", "image": "https://photos.classiccars.com/cc-temp/listing/177/8667/42176232-1993-porsche-968-thumb.jpg", "model": "968", "year": "1993", "price": "$89,000 (OBO)", "listId": "CC-1778667", "desc": "- Chassis # WPOZZZ962PS815259\nWhen Porsche released the 968 in 1991, it was the last of a few things, including the last new front-engined Porsche until the Cayenne arrived in 2003 and the last of a series of water-cooled front-engine rear-wheel drive models that began in 1976 with the 924 and later the 944. While the 968 was supposed to be yet another revised model of the 944, dubbed the S3, Porsche decided it would be best to make it its own model thanks to the significant changes the engineers had made to the chassis.\nTo appease those with a love for speed, Porsche released a lightweight version of the 968 dubbed the “Clubsport” from October 1992 to 1995. Many of the luxury features of the 968 were removed or made an option in pursuit of sheer performance. The car had less sound deadening, manual windows, manually adjustable lightweight Recaro racing seats a revised and lowered suspension system, wider 17-inch wheels, a thicker, three-spoke sports steering wheel with no airbag, non-heated washer jets, no engine bay vanity covers, no rear wiper, no rear seats, and a smaller battery. 1993 Clubsport models were only available in Grand Prix White, Black, Speed Yellow, Guards Red, or Maritime Blue with matching seat backs. Clubsport decals were standard in either black, red, or white, but they could also be deleted if wanted.\nThe 968 CS used the same 3.0 L M44 I4 engine from the regular 968 backed by either a 6-speed manual, which this one is equipped with, or 4-speed Tiptronic automatic. The Clubsport weighed 2,910 lb (1,320 kg), or around 220 lb (~100 kg) lighter than the regular 968, which gave it a 5.6 second 0-60 mph time and a top speed of 162 mph (260 km/h).\nClubsport models were only available in the UK, Europe, Japan, and Australia, and a total of 1232 were produced over three years.\nThis particular example, Chassis # WPOZZZ962PS815259, was first registered in August 1993 in the Netherlands. It was painted in Speed Yellow over a Black/Speed Yellow Leatherette & Cloth interior, the same color scheme it wears today. Options included Equipment for France, a higher amperage battery, the rare limited-slip differential, air conditioning, and the anti-theft package, according to the Porsche Production Specifications document. It was very well maintained throughout the years, with a plethora of service records attesting to this.\nSome significant service records to note are new adjustable Koni shocks from V.D. Gugten in Bodegraven, Netherlands, in March of 2013 and new timing belts from RS Motors Porsche Centre West-Vlaanderen in Ingelmunster, Belgium, on July 5th of 2018.\nAround 2018, the car was imported into New Hampshire, where it was enjoyed until we acquired it sometime in June of 2023. We entrusted Mark Cavanaugh in Beverly, NJ, with performing the few services this 968 CS needed to be as perfect as it could be. Items included new door handle gaskets, windshield wipers, lower plastics, thermostat & seals, wheelhouse liners, power steering reservoir & hose, along with a few hose clamps, minor touchups, and repairs.\nIf a track car is what you’re after, you cannot go wrong with a Porsche 968 CS, especially one with the LSD option like this one. The difference in handling will absolutely be clear over one without the LSD, and the impact of the 220 lb loss over the regular 968 is hard to overstate. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the original owner’s manual, tool kit, factory brochures, German paperwork, the service records on file, and an extra set of keys.\n Please visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

The Series 1 Elise was produced from 1996 to 2001, with the Series 2 coming along later that year to meet new European crash regulations. \nThe Series 2 was produced until 2011 and featured a new Lotus-developed ECU and was the first car produced by the British marque to be designed on a computer. The Elise delivered stateside was powered by a Toyota 2ZZ-GE 1.8 L I4 tuned by Lotus to 190 hp and backed by a Toyota C64 6-speed manual transmission. Figures from the test showed a 0–60 mph time of approximately 4.9 seconds.\nThe small size, great handling, and relatively budget-friendly price of the Elise made it a popular choice for drivers who wanted both a track-friendly car that was equally as usable in the city. Despite its price, all three generations had exotic car-like looks that set it apart from other sports cars on the market at the time. According to a post on the Lotus Talk forums, certificates provided by Lotus historian Andy Graham point to 3,323 examples of the Lotus Elise being produced in 2005, 202 of those being in Racing Green Metallic.\nThis particular example, Chassis # SCCPC11195HL31931, was brought into the port of Charleston, SC from the UK in February of 2005 in Racing Green Metallic over a *** interior. It was delivered to Manhattan Motor Cars in New York, NY in May of that year and was used as one of two demonstrator cars at the dealership. The manual windows point to this Elise being a very early car as subsequent cars had electric windows. \nThe first owner purchased the car in November 2006 with 900 miles on the odometer. The car was upgraded to 2006-spec through dealer-fitted, factory-supplied parts, including the rear wing, the rear Lotus badge, LED tail lamps with European amber turn lenses, and the supercharger. In August of 2007, the selling dealer performed the first service record on file, a 7,500-mile service despite the odometer reading less than 2,000 miles, and serviced the blower motor as well.\nIn 2012, the owner had a number of factory upgrades installed in recognition of the newly announced Jim Clark Type 25 Elise. They had a Type 25 interior fitted by the Lotus dealer on Long Island, which included the Type 25 wooden gear knob, rear window cap, hard top, and yellow highlights on the rear wing painted by Chuck Reiser in 2005 Lotus yellow. The owner also had the correct black Type 25 wheels fitted that currently wear brand-new Yokohama Advan tires. The original Blaupunkt radio was also changed for a similar Blaupunkt model with Bluetooth capability. Any and all of the parts that were swapped out during this transformation were kept and are included in the sale of the car. \nThe Elise continued to be serviced at Manhattan Motor Cars and the Lotus dealer on Long Island until 2015, when it began being kept in highly professional storage in upstate New York. As it sits, this is a well-maintained, one-owner Lotus Elise with less than 5,000 miles on the odometer and unique Type 25 factory upgrades to help it stand out from the rest at your local British-only car show. Those looking to partake in the car that gave Lotus its modern reputation for lightweight, driver-focused cars would fall in love with what this Elise offers, especially with the Type 25 supercharger under the hood.\nUpon purchase, the new owner will receive the original owner’s literature, purchase documents, window sticker, and service records on file. The car also comes with its original rims bearing an unused set of correct Bridgestone tires, the original Blaupunkt radio, the original unpainted engine covers, soft-top, hard-top, original seats, all the original pieces that were replaced for the 2006 spec update, door cards, lotus branded car cover, original steering wheel, and more. \n"}

Especially towards the end of the 1950’s and into the early 1960s, Studebaker had design face lifts from Brooks Stevens and really began to get into the performance game. The Avanti was ahead of its time in design and the Studebaker 289 V8 was a great engine. They offered a variety of models and configurations, but the best and rarest was the addition of the R2 package in any of the models offered by Studebaker; Lark, Hawk and Avanti. The R2 package boosted horsepower with the addition of a huge Mcculloch belt driven supercharger placed on top of the Studebaker 289. The R2’s are awesome and could also be had with the optional Hallibrand wheels. The R2 cars were competitive race cars in stock form right from the factory and are an extremely rare sighting today especially a very late Super Hawk which was the most refined and most powerful R2 Hawk produced. Only a handful of original Super Hawks exist today. \nOffered here is an incredibly well preserved 1964 Studebaker Gran Tourismo Hawk with the rare R2 package and just 44,000 original miles from new. It still retains most of its original black paint, original red upholstery and it runs and drives well. The supercharged 289 is in proper running order and the transmission automatic transmission shifts as it should. Its equipped with power steering and power brakes making it very easy to drive. To really bring this R2 Hawk over the top, it is equipped with its original set of Studebaker Halibrand wheels which is a very are option for the R2 cars.

In classic roadster fashion, a long hood and short rear deck composed the overall shape. However, the lines were far from the typical teutonic straightedges commonly seen in the period, and instead, designer Joji Nagashima employed the softer, rounder shapes from the roadsters of the past. Every single body panel possesses some form of curvature, an element that surely gave the manufacturing side of the business a bit of a headache. Fortunately, it all works quite well, and today, the Z3 looks like nothing BMW has put out before or since, and the boldness of the design has aged remarkably well. \n \nEnthusiasts of the brand might have been saddened to see an inline-6 unavailable at launch under that long hood, but all could rest assured that BMW would deliver soon enough. Many could be satisfied with the lightness and responsiveness of the 4-cylinder models, but more power always tends to make things better. Just a year after the car’s introduction, the traditional Inline-6 arrived along with deliciously punched out fenders allowing for a 2.5inch wider rear track. It was only a matter of time now before the M-division got its hands on the little roadster.\n \nFalling in line with E36 M3, North American examples of the new Z3 M Roadster were fitted with the S52 engine upon release. While down on power from its more exotic, individual throttle-bodied cousin, this bored and stroked M52 motor is not without its merits in the context of the contemporary automotive scene. At the end of the day, a naturally aspirated inline-6 with a 7,000rpm redline makes for an enticing proposition to any gearhead.\n \nThe Z3 M Roadster on offer here, chassis # WBSCK9333XLC89705, is a 1-owner example finished in Estoril Blue over a full black interior. Showing just 24,266 miles this is one of the most well cared for examples we have handled. Delivered new to Roadshow BMW in Tennessee, the car was immediately sent to its one and only owner in Decatur, Illinois. From here the owner began thoroughly enjoying the Z3 as he put roughly 6,000 miles on the car in its first two summers. Over the next 6 years usage became less frequent but still regular with proper maintenance carried out along the way. As it sits today this Z3 is entirely unmodified and ready for continued use after a baseline fluids swap as the last service was done in late 2020, or roughly 1,000 miles ago. This Z3 M Roadster presents a great opportunity to acquire a collector grade example of the platform. With a handwritten log documenting every service and the miles corresponding to them you know exactly how meticulously maintained the car really is. \n \nIncluded in the sale are the tools, first aid kit, black leather tonneau cover, the Z3 Roadster branded tonneau carrier case, and available service records and logs.\n \nPlease visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

This Truck came from South Africa and was one of the rare ones that was well preserved. It was used has a extreme safari vehicle, and was retired and later restored. Comes with Clean Florida Title.\nThey were made until the early 70's and later on ceased production. Very few were actually manufactured, and most of them that did were never sold to the civilian market. Most of the Forward Control were sold as work trucks, and were generally worked hard. This hard work combined with relatively low production numbers, means that few Forward Controls survive. Many of the survivors are conversions (e.g.. camper vans and fire engines) that led a less strenuous life. This distinctive vehicle was based on the Series II 109\" chassis but had the cab positioned over the engine, resulting in a greatly increased load space. A new rear sub-frame was attached to the 109\" chassis to produce a flat load space. The result was a vehicle rated at carrying 30 cwt on the road, and 25 cwt cross-country.\nThe original engine was a 4-cylinder 2.25-litre diesel engine and now has a more reliable Chevrolet 250cid Straight-six engine. You can find parts easily for this engine and order them online as well. Has 4-speed transmission. Check out my video of the 109 FC driving. It sits really high and is just cool to drive! It has 2 radiators, one with one big fan and the other radiator with 2 fans. Car runs cool! It has really nice brown upholstery that was redone. Has a roof latch that lets you access the roof area. Also has a full storage area in the back. Has the rear guard bar with full spare. You can also but your bicycle in the back. It also has a water tank. Lots of really cool features. Apparently less then 2,500 were made! \nI'm located in Miami about 30 minutes away from the airport. Feel free to come see the Truck in person. Any inquires email me.

In 1965 the Electra-Glide was upgraded with an electric start but the big change was in 1966 when the Panhead gave way to the new “Shovelhead”. It had an aluminum head with a different-shaped combustion chamber and rocker arms attached to the rocker cover instead of to the head itself. By 1969 the factory “King of the Highway” package included a removable batwing fairing on the handlebars, hard saddlebags and a top case at the rear. 1970 was the year that AMF took control of Harley-Davidson and significant changes were made to the FLH which included relocating the ignition inside the gear case cover and the generator was replaced with an alternator inside the primary case. In 1972 a front disc brake was added. When it was brand new this particular example was optioned with the “King of the Highway” package in addition to a Harley stereo pod with stereo and speakers. Other than the wear items this bike is all original. Not only that but it is a 2 owner bike that the current owner purchased in 1985 and has an incredibly low 20,404 miles. The second owner purchased it with just over 19,000 original miles and has barely ridden it since. It was recently serviced and runs incredibly well. Everything is working as it should and it is need of nothing but a new home. If you’d like that to be your home we suggest reaching out right away!\n"}

Recently I upgraded the front drum brakes to a Wilwood 6 piston Disc brake with power assist. I was able to utilize the original hubs.

The floors were fully insulated and covered in custom fitted German Square weave carpet. I added a Retrosound stereo that has bluetooth with Mic for phone calls with Infiniti speakers. there are also two USB plug ins.

Car crafting had gone toward a more radical approach as the 1960s era began, and this creation ---- aptly named Legacy ----- captures that theme from every angle. Of course, programs of this nature began with a 'hot mill,\" as the writers would say, in the case a crrca-1962 327 CI Corvette V-8 engine with extensive detailing and equipped with a front-mounted 6-71 crankshaft-driven blower kit. Using period - appearing side-draft carburetors, gold and chrome plating with custom hand engraving abound on this powerplant, while a Hurst shift arm directs the transmission behind it. From the exterior, one notes the roofline ---- which came from a 1957 Buick ----- is chopped 3 inched and then channeled 5 inches at the front, graduating to 2.5 inches at the rear. The rear fender wells are boxed and the fender ends themselves were extended 6 inches and raised 1.5 inches, with 1959 Cadillac tail lights installed. Even the trunk is shopped 8 inches. A 1961 Chrysler front fender assembly showcases extended angular headlamps, with the front fender wells flared with 3/4-inch chromoly tubing and boxed to conceal wiring. Metal fabrication was utilized throughout the build with no fiberglass. A 1962 Jaguar independent rear suspension (widened 8 inches), front suspension and Jaguar universal joints provide underpinnings and components are either gold or chrome plated. The engine rests in hand-built motor mounts, while brake and gas lines have been enclosed within the modified square-tube frame. The deep tones selected for the paint are dramatic, with a power blue custom interior inside. The most modern upgrade beyond that is a set of Colorado Custom wheels that put it to the pavement through BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires. Through a car club jacket is not part of the sale, you'll feel like you are part of a select group of owners with Jim Cusumano's Legacy. \n"}

History: I bought this car back in 2009 as a project. It was headed for a “turn into a convertible” project. It had no engine or transmission in it. The body was all there and most of the trim was complete. The first thing I did was pull the body off the chassis. I had the chassis blasted and painted chassis black. Then the body went off to get body worked and painted. I went with the color it was—Harbor blue and India Ivory. The paint was a modern color Harbor blue.\nI will describe the car as I remember. I have done the work and have owned this car since 2009. Let’s talk about the drivetrain. It has a GM 350 Crate motor with an Edelbrock carb. The transmission is a Metric 200. It has new U-Joints, and the rear end is stock. Today, the 6 th of May 2023, I removed all 4 wheels, inspected the brakes and cylinders, the drums, and the hoses, and they are all good. Pictures attached. I then cleaned the wheels and white walls, re-installed them, and torqued all lug nuts to 95-foot pounds. Note here: The rear tires and rims come off the car without disconnecting the shocks like some of the resto-rods need. The steering is very nice and easy. I had installed the ‘poor man’s power steering’ bearing idler arm kit and it is nice. The original wheel makes the car steer very easily. The shocks were all new. The chassis was black and the under body of the car is blue. You can see that there is no rust on the floors.\n \nThe body has ZERO rust. It was solid to start with and has always been in heated storage when not driven. Over the years that I have owned this car, it has had less than 4,000 miles on it. The speedo gear is off quite a bit, so the odometer reading is over what is shows which is 4,300 and some miles. It runs down the road very nicely.\n \nThe stereo system in the car is nice and sounds great! I have a radio in the dash only for a filler. The under-dash unit works great and BOOM’s as it should.\n \nThe interior is done like it should be back in 1956. New seat covers, new carpet, bladder type padded dash, new visors, new headliner (my favorite part of the car), new door panels and the door sills were the last set NEW in the country! They are beautiful.\n \nIt has a nice new firewall pad and the under dash is nice. It has new wiring.\n \nIt was Safety inspected back a few years ago and passed with flying colors.\n \nYou can drive and show this rare beauty to any car show with great results, and you will be the talk of the town!!! Fly in and drive it back to your home…enjoy the ride!! \n"}

Of course, this only added to its appeal and is still renowned for its driving dynamics today. Also, while the 930 served as the homologation basis for Porsche’s fearsome 934 racers, it was no stripped-down track weapon. Turbos were luxuriously equipped, with a long list of standard equipment including air-conditioning, full leather, a rear wiper, headlamp washers, and a stereo. Further options, including a power sunroof, were offered as well.\nIn 1978, Porsche updated the model with a larger 3.3-liter engine with a stated US-market output of 253 horsepower, an air-to-air intercooler, revised suspension, and new brakes. With the US emissions restrictions tightening once again in 1980, 1979 became the last model year that the Porsche 930 was specified for the American market for some time to come.\n"}

While the design was American, the cars were built in the United Kingdom—the bodywork was built by Fisher & Ludlow while the mechanicals and final assembly were by the Austin Motor Company.\nIt was the first time an American-designed car had been entirely built in Europe. While most U.S. automobile makers were following a “bigger-is-better” philosophy, Nash Motor Company executives were scrutinizing the market to offer American buyers an economical transportation alternative. It was designed as a “commuter/shopping car” with resemblance to the big Nash, but on a significantly smaller scale. Owners reported that the “Metropolitan is a good thing in a small package”.\nIt is powered by the Austin A50 1489-cc, 52-hp engine coupled with a three-speed manual transmission.\nRecent Service includes New brake hoses, oil/filter change, heater hoses, coolant flush, wheel cylinders, ignition coil, rebuilt/refurbished Carburetor , and newer radial tires\nIncluded with the sale Jack, Jack bag cover and a New soft top\nAll of the lights are functioning\n \n"}

A restoration was done several years ago and included a rebuild of the engine, transmission, and injection pump. It has aftermarket air conditioning, 2002 Turbo sport seats, RS Watanabe wheels, upgraded shocks and springs, MOMO Prototipo steering wheel, and Marchal headlights. The vehicle is in California.\nExterior\nDuring the restoration the car was repainted in its original Golf yellow. The seller notes a rust bubble in front of and behind the left rear wheel well and a few on the lower R door. The spare tire bay bottom was replaced, and exhibits some surface rust. This 2002 has a factory sunroof and aftermarket RS Watanabe wheels which are a replica of the popular Minilite wheels. It features the round taillights of an early 2002 which gave it the nickname “roundie”. The bumpers were rechromed, and the suspension was lowered with firmer springs and shocks added for better handling. The seller notes the ride is firm but enjoyable and the car handles well. An ANSA performance exhaust and brighter Marchal headlights were also added. The tires are a newer Japanese brand.\nInterior\nThe black interior was reupholstered during the restoration in new aftermarket vinyl and the carpet was replaced. The front sport seats are from a 1974 BMW Turbo. This 2002tii has the stock Euro-version gauges with additional gauges for oil pressure and ammeter. It has an aftermarket MOMO Prototipe steering wheel and an AM/FM Japanese radio. The seller noted some small cracks in the dash and tear in the headliner.\nMechanicals\nThis 1973 BMW 2002tii has only 55,000 kilometers on the odometer (around 35,000 miles). The vehicle restoration was done several years ago and included a rebuild of the engine, transmission, and fuel injection pump. The seller notes that there are no noticeable leaks and vehicle was recently inspected and serviced.\nSummary\nThis BMW 2002tii has the desirable round taillights and popular upgrades consisting of sunroof, A/C, 2002 Turbo sport seats, additional gauges for oil pressure and ammeter, MOMO steering wheel, firmer suspension, ANSA exhaust, alloy wheels, and upgraded headlights. It has benefited from a complete service and can be inspected and test driven anytime.\n"}

Originally it was introduced as an optional package for the F-85 and Cutlass models. The 2nd generation was introduced in 1968 which is when the 442 became its own model. In 1969 the changes were subtle and included a division tooth between the grilles, the wing windows were deleted, trunk lid inlets were added for the tail lights and headrests were added to the front seats. This particular example is believed to be a 4 owner car with 38,268 original miles. It retains its original 396026 400ci V8 engine that was professionally rebuilt by Jimmie’s Motor Rebuilding Co. out of Peru, IL in August of 2021. At the same time the original T400 transmission was also rebuilt and both now have less than 1,000 miles on them. It is fed via an Edelbrock 4 barrel carb and Performer intake. It is sparked by an electronic ignition and exhaust is handled by a set of performance headers and a new performance dual exhaust system which sounds just plain nasty when you get into it. At the same time the engine was rebuilt the suspension received new springs and pads and the brakes received a new master cylinder, wheel cylinders and lines. It also received new steel braided fuel lines, vacuum lines, transmission lines, coolant lines, a new water pump and a new radiator. It was repainted in its original color of Red about 20 years ago which has held up very well but is starting to show its age. All the weather stripping was replaced when the engine was done as well and everything lines up and closes as it should. The interior is all original with the exception of the B&M slap shifter and the aftermarket gauges. Everything works as it should except for the voltage meter and the gas gauge. When it was repainted it was also upgraded with the W-32 dual snorkel air intake which is 100% correct. Pictures of the engine casting and serial #’s are posted below. The car is an absolute pleasure to drive and in need of nothing but having a couple of gauges repaired. Based on the current NADA values we would conservatively appraise this beauty at $49,600. We have priced it much lower than that to get her sold quick so if you like what you see don’t wait until it is too late to contact us!\n"}

It was Studebaker’s top of the line model that evolved from the 1956 Golden Hawk. The 1962 model was brilliantly redesigned by Brooks Stevens by putting on a new grille, shaving off the fins and adding a new squarer roofline. Despite the fact that the Studebaker engine was heavy for its size the GT Hawk boasted performance and handling not typically found in an American made car. This particular example is equipped with its original 289ci V8 rated at 225hp and is mated to a Flight-O-Matic automatic transmission. It was optioned with A/C, a clock, a tachometer, deluxe floor mats and a gorgeous two-tone interior. It was repainted in its original color of Studebaker Blaze Red about 10 years ago and it still shows like new. It is a rust free car that was relocated from Colorado to the Midwest just after being repainted and has not seen a winter since. Everything but the clock works as it should. The A/C was just serviced and blows ice cold. The car has 75,929 original miles and is need of nothing but a basic service and a new garage to park in.\n"}

A wonderfully spacious tourer packed with class, Jaguar's flagship where they loved to show off all their gadgets and new gizmos. The fastest four-seater in the world when the car first rolled off the assembly line. The car was rarely delivered as a coupé anyway, which now makes this a real collector's item.\nAnyway, enough about investment and performance, let's talk about what lasting impression this car leaves behind. After all, a Jaguar driver also knows that you have to drive this car with respect. That means that the sports hangover of yesteryear should purr quietly, not roar. It is sometimes said in the car world, the car looks like its owner. However, this tomcat also knows how to take the owner with her grandeur. Indeed, when you get in, you immediately get the feeling that you know about opera, wine, politics and poetry.\nOurs? Dutch delivered! A 6-cylinder what feels slightly more favourable in terms of consumption and weight ratio than the 12-cylinder and can still slot in well. Fully taken care of on the operating table so you can enjoy this classic car carefree. To top it all off, fully documented too!

The first-generation Dodge Ram trucks were manufactured from 1981 to 1993 and are known for their boxy and utilitarian design. This 1985 Ram pickup truck is one of the cleanest examples you will find from this generation of Dodge trucks.\nThis Ram is a hard-to-find and desirable vehicle for a couple reasons. Being that this vehicle is originally from Arizona, it is rust free. Secondly, it came from the factory equipped with a short bed and full 4WD functionality. This truck is also powered by its original powertrain as it sports its original 318 cubic inch V8 engine that is mated to an automatic transmission. The 4WD shifter sits in the middle of the floor in the cab making it easy to shift into the functional 4WD system. The vehicle shows about 82,000 miles, but total mileage is unknown. The exterior is in great shape and has a very dashing appearance as its bright red and white two-tone color scheme is separated by black and gray pinstripes that can be seen around the entirety of the vehicle.\nMoving to the suspension, this truck has been upgraded with a Rancho suspension and sits on 31” Dick Cepek all-terrain tires and 15” chrome Ram wheels. The truck features both power steering and power brakes with disc brakes up front. All these features result in a ride that is both comfortable and safe for a classic truck like this one. The interior of this single cab truck is in very good condition and features no rips or tears. You will be cooled down by the factory air conditioning system and will be switching through the different stations through its modern radio system.\nIf you are in the market for a classic pickup truck that will make you feel like you are back in the 1980’s then this is the truck for you. Its stock appearance, original powertrain, and super clean body and frame is what makes this vehicle look like it recently came off the showroom floor.

L-head V-8, three-speed manual transmission, solid front axle, semi-elliptic leaf spring suspension, and rear-wheel drum brakes. Wheelbase: 128 in.\nVintage speedsters have been produced by enthusiasts on a variety of chassis, but this is one of very few built on the basis of a Peerless, the Cleveland-built car considered one of the “Three P’s” of great American motoring, alongside the famous Packard and Pierce-Arrow. Peerless was renowned in its time for its durable, conservative engineering, reflected in the long-term reliability of its product.\nFormer owner Ivan Jones and his late wife, Audrey, of Littleton, Colorado, spent the late 1970s painstakingly gathering parts for the car from points East and West. Mr. Jones was a car aficionado and skilled craftsman. Inspired by the speedsters produced by Peerless in the teens, they then built this automobile, together, by hand, completing it in 1981. The car is well-finished, with fenders reminiscent of Brass Era performance cars such as Simplex and American Underslung, a 1922-23 Peerless radiator shell, Peerless Model 66 drum headlights, and cream wire wheels, shod in blackwall tires.\nThe interior features two bucket seats, in the manner of the Mercer Raceabout, forward of a large original Peerless-badged oval gas tank with fillers on both ends, wooden storage box, and dual rear-mounted spares. All components except for the body panels are Peerless, with the seats and teak dashboard being Mr. Jones’ own creations. The windshield frame was cast from a wooden prototype made by Mr. Jones. He even went so far as to shoot the elk that donated its hide to the seats, lovingly upholstered by Mrs. Jones.\nPower is supplied by a 1923 332 cu. in. Peerless V-8 and three-speed transmission, on the original frame, all acquired after years spent powering a sawmill in the Midwest. Side exhaust emerges from the right side of the hood and disappears under the body, a touch reminiscent of period Grand Prix cars as well as supercharged Duesenbergs. Current owner added a gear-vender overdrive for comfortable cruising speeds.\nIvan and Audrey Jones subsequently traveled the United States with the speedster that they dubbed “The Fearless Peerless.” Together the trio enjoyed several tours with the Veteran Motor Car Club of America. Among its duties was leading the parade lap for Indy drivers at the Denver Grand Prix in 2006, driven by longtime friend Jimmy Aretakis. It was also well-known in print, appearing on the cover of the May/June 2002 issue of the VMCCA magazine,\nThere are few more distinctive, fun vintage speedsters than this car – a truly one-of-a-kind creation, with robust, well-proven performance and bodywork crafted with love and care. It is genuinely thrilling to drive and ready to add more adventures to its long history.\n"}

As the only American-designed, mass-produced passenger car with a rear-mounted, air-cooled engine, the Corvair was manufactured and marketed in two-door coupe, convertible, four-door sedan, four-door station wagon, passenger van, commercial van, and pickup truck body styles in its first generation (1960–1964) as well as two-door coupe, convertible and four-door sedan in its second generation (1965–1969). In 1962, Chevrolet introduced the Corvairs with few changes at the beginning of the year. The bottom line 500 series station wagon was dropped and the 700 became the base station wagon. The \"Lakewood\" name was dropped. The ever-popular Monza line then took on a wagon model to round out the top of the line. In spring of 1962, Chevrolet committed itself to the sporty image they had created for the Corvair by introducing a convertible version.\nThis first year convertible is really a great, low-mileage example. This is a high performance (102hp) Super Turbo-Air model with the corresponding \"YN\" engine code and crossed racing flags on the deck-lid. It spent most of its life in Georgia and most of its 57 year history is known. After being stored and never driven once between 1974-1989 it was purchased by the 2nd owner. He drove it periodically and decided to complete a restoration in 2004. Photo documentation of this first restoration accompany this sale. The seller also provided us with a large stack of documentation including GA registration history, period literature, original dealer badge, and several receipts. When we received the Corvair this year it had just enough wear that we decided to complete a second restoration. Our first step was to leave the Corvair with a local expert who did a complete rebuild of the drivetrain. We then did a complete repaint in the original Antique White. The battery is new and the Corvair just received a full tune-up. The final addition was a set of 185/80 R15 White Wall Tires! Needless to say, we think we have this 72k mile example standing tall and ready for the next owner to enjoy.

ownership will be transferred via bill of sale only.\nThe S2000 class is very popular and offers plenty of racing opportunities on a reasonable budget.  Further, this Lola is easy to drive and will perform at the limit, with lap times in the upper 2:20’s at Road America (most recently run in April 2023).  It is in race-ready condition and has been professionally maintained by Wynnfurst Racing for the last few years.  Whether you are looking to venture into amateur racing or augment an existing stable, this one has a lot to offer.\n \n"}

Power & a Ride like no other but only room for a few good friends.\nCurrent owner is a true Ford & Lincoln fan, and has owned this Mark III for about 14 years now. He found it in North Jackson Ohio and it was originally delivered new by the Lincoln dealer in Ambridge Pa. New battery and tray, 4 new shocks, new calipers & pads, brake cylinders & shoes completed fall of 2021. Though driven little, you are seeing it in it’s natural condition without any professional detail. Oil and filter change every year or two. Owner is also a Torino fan and has one of those. Can’t drive them all! 4 extra original hubcaps go with the car.\n \nFor more information and photos visit our site at www.autoconnectioncars.com or call Chad at 330-353-1750\n \nDETAILS OF CAR:\n \n460 V-8, Auto Temperature Control Air Conditioning & Heating, Unique Factory Vinyl Top, AM-FM Stereo, Power Steering, Power Brakes, 6 Way Power seats on driver & passenger side, Auto Transmission, P Antenna, White Wall Radials, Inside Trunk Release, Remote Drivers Mirror, Traction Lock with 2:80 highway Gearing. Tilt Steering Wheel, Sure Track Braking, Reclining Passenger Seat, Split Bench Seating. Also includes an owners manual (see pics) \nMarti Report and Marti window sticker included / title Indicates “actual” Mileage\n \nPaint\n \n* Paint has a very nice reflective shine and a finish that looks much as when they were produced in that era. Slight orange peal as typical.\n \n* Paint matches well all the way around the sides and upper surfaces\n \n* Looks and seems to possibly be all or mostly all original paint that it was born with. Read comments in magnetic paint gauge section for explanation.\nWe can’t be 100% sure since owner hasn’t had car since 1971 when new\n \n* See pictures for details of small defects that exist in paint finish.\n \n* There are a few nicks and worn spots (above left rear tire) in the paint. A couple or more nicks on fenders, doors, and quarters and a few scuffs not completely through the paint and might possibly be polished out. (see pics)\n \nBody\n \n* Body panels in general are very nice and straight.\n \n* Exceptions being 3 very slight dimples you can see on the hood and 1 slight dimple in the pass side door, but only at just the right angle and under high intensity lighting. (see pics)\n \n* Fits and gaps around hood, trunk, and doors are very consistent with what you would have expected to see when car was new. (See pics)\n \nMagnetic Paint Gauge\n \n* \n \n* Hood and trunk readings were consistently in the 4 to 5 mils range. This in our opinion would more likely be consistent with an aged and polished original surface vs a repainted surface.\n \n* Side panels (front to back), readings were typically in the 4 to 6 mils range with below the lower body line being more in the 2-4 mils range.\n \n* Along bottom of all body panels showed no higher readings indicating repair of rust or paint.\n \n* inspection of door jambs did not indicate any obvious signs of repaint or over spray and actually showed human & weatherstrip wear consistent with use and older paint.\n \nBright work\n \n* \n \n* Overall bright works has a nice highly reflective finish and shows well.\n \n* Bright work surrounding windows is very reflective with some scratching below drivers door glass and typical pot metal pitting on molding immediately behind the LR window. (see pics)\n \n* Moldings running along the top of fenders and doors are very shiny and mostly flawless. ( couple little scuffs)\n \n* Door handles are very reflective with just a few typical scratches along the top.\n \n* Drivers rear view mirror shell is very reflective with a small amount of pitting on top.\n \n* Grill work, front and rear bumper all have good reflective qualities but show a little bit of light wear\n \n* Rear bumper middle has light impact crease running top to bottom and has affected the molding directly above (see pics).\n \nGlass\n \n* Windshield, rear glass, and all 4 side glass all have the Car-Lite emblem\n \n* Glass is all nice and clear. We do not see any discoloring, delamination, bulls eyes, cracks, or any wiper wear.\n \n* Windshield may have a few pin head sized nicks from normal driving and drivers window does have a group of light vertical scratches at top from normal window movement (see pics).\n \nVinyl Top\n \n* \n \n* Seams running down both sides are in good condition without any signs of splitting apart.\n \n* There are a couple little bumps by lower right rear window glass but top doesn’t show signs of significant rust issues under material ( see pics)\n \n* Coloring is a dark green but does have some areas of slightly lighter appearance. Professional cleaning or dressing may offer some improvement (see pics).\n \n \n \nMechanical\n \n \nTest drive\n \nChad rode with the owner for about a 5 mile ride in the country. Chad then drove back on different road conditions. The engine and transmission seemed to perform smoothly and correctly. Car steered, turned, stopped, and accelerated as you would expect. Braking was smooth without pulsation or pulling. Ride was beautifully smooth and quiet. I would say the car pretty much operated as it was designed to. Premium fuel and lead additive recommended.\n"}

Since she hasn’t been exposed to road salt, her frame and undercarriage are solid and making her worthy of the investment required in a Classic Gentleman restoration.

We are often told by the seller, “My Jeep is excellent and needs nothing” however, being in this profession, we know to expect and plan for a great deal of sorting. Remember the average age of these vehicles is over thirty years old and even with loving care many the cosmetics and mechanical parts have aged and worn accordingly. When a Classic Gentleman Grand Wagoneer arrives at your home, it is a special occasion and the Grand will be in beautiful condition. Yes, our sales are as-is, but as you will see from our detailed document files that your Grand has been looked after carefully.

The 3rd generation Continental was produced form 1958 – 1960 and marked a significant body design to separate itself from the Mercury line to enable Lincoln to outdo Cadillac. With an overall length of 227 inches the 3rd generation Continentals were the longest mass produced vehicle ever sold in the U.S with the exception of the very rare 34-37 Cadillac V16 convertibles. For 1959 the Mark IV saw minor changes with the restyled grill that enabled the headlights cluster to be integrated into the egg crate grille. Standard equipment is the 430 ci V8 mated to a 3 speed Turbo-Drive automatic transmission. This particular example was finished in a gorgeous Copper Poly paint with a Glacier White vinyl interior and top.  It is nicely optioned with 6-way power seats, power locks, power vent windows, a heater & defroster, a locking gas cap, rocker panel moldings, a “Travel Tuner” AM radio with dual speakers and white sidewall tires. It is a 4 owner car with 97,846 original miles and everything is 100% original with no restoration work of any kind having been done. It was just serviced and tuned up. The tires and battery were changed not long ago so she is in need of nothing but a new home. Based on its present condition and factoring in the flaws you will find in the paint, interior and trim work we would classify this as # 3 vehicle and as such would appraise it at $48,700. We are serious about finding it a new home and have priced it accordingly.

Internally referred to as W121 (BII or B2), it was first shown in prototype at the 1954 New York Auto Show, and was available with an optional removable hardtop.The 190 SL was powered by a new, slightly oversquare 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) Type M121 BII 1.9 L straight-four SOHC engine. Based on the 300 SL's straight six, it had an unchanged 85 mm bore and 4.3 mm reduced 83.6 mm stroke, was fitted with twin-choke dual Solex carburetors, and produced gross 120 hp (89 kW; 122 PS). In detuned form, it was later used in the W120 180 and W121 190 models.\nDescription:\nThis is an unfinished Mercedes-Benz 190 SL project. Finished the throughly prepping process, the car was painted original white color . Painting process started with epoxy primer, seam sealer and finished with high grade PPG paint. Result was a perfect \"bondo free\" smooth body. Many interior parts were already redone, but there are still some parts to be properly finished. All brakes, suspension, sub-frame, Differential and miscellaneous parts were carefully media blasted, and are ready  installed back to the car.\n"}

This special example left the factory in Rangoon Red with a red interior, a 390 cubic inch V8 with a 4bbl carburetor paired to a Cruise-a-Matic, a 3.00:1 ratio axle, and power steering. It has been garaged and pampered since new and it shows. It includes the original owner's manual and information tags.\nThe exterior still wears its original Rangoon Red paint which has held up phenomenally. The chrome, trim, emblems, hubcaps, original issue black & gold California license plates, glass, and lenses are equally well-preserved making this attractive old Galaxie an anomaly and a glimpse of 60 years into the past.\nInside is equally as amazing and completely original including upholstery, door cards, panels, headliner, dash, gauges, and even the carpet is factory original. The car is comfortable and quiet inside with all working gauges, the only inoperable item is the clock. It is a lovely ride indeed. The trunk still has its original panel cars, mat, spare, and jack instructions.\nThe original factory 390 cubic inch engine fires up effortlessly and has excellent power. It runs smoothly, quietly, and burns clean. The braking, steering, and handling feel tight though the steering rack is leaking and should be renewed in the not-too-distant future.

The top is a Gator top that has been replaced but is the original style and color. The interior is mostly original as well with only the door cards replaced along the way. The only modifications made to this Charger were to lower the suspension, as well as fitting aftermarket wheels. Purchased by the current owner in 1994, the Charger has been stored indoors and seldomly driven. The drivetrain is not numbers matching but is period correct. Other notable options this Charger features are bucket seats, power steering, tachometer, interior light package, hood mount turn signals, AM w/ 8 track, and more. This would be the perfect driver or starting point for a restoration or resto-mod as it is complete, runs and drives well, and has very minimal body surface rust where paint has been chipped or scratched.

This is my personal car that I have decided to let go of as I'm downsizing my small collection. It was purchased new in California and has remained here since new. It comes with a clear, California title and clean Carfax report.\nThe 3.0 Liter engine starts easily, runs and idles smoothly and clean with plenty of power, and passes the California smog inspection without issue. The shifting is tight along with the braking and handling. It is a very nice driving W126 all around.\nThe exterior shows nicely and all of the paint looks to be original and well-preserved with only the front left fender looking to have been repainted. The trim, glass, and lenses all look nice however the chromed factory wheels are corroded so its new owner may wish to strip and repaint. Otherwise, it's a great-looking car that appears to have spent most of its life indoors.\nThe interior is immaculate. The leather on the front seats is in excellent condition having been covered in sheepskin for years. All systems are in very good working order though recently the radio reception has failed. The gauges, switches, horn, and lights all work well and the air conditioning blows cool at 62f though I will add a can of refrigerant to top it off before delivery/shipping. The trunk is equally nice with tools, jack, and spare all present.\nYou'll notice in the trunk the personalized \"W126\" California license plates, these were on the car when I purchased and I am happy to transfer them to the new owner should they decide to use them.\nBe sure to check out the nearly 300 photos and the video at www.leftcoastclassics.com.

That is exactly the question that this restoration project was designed around. Built in the factory as a K-10 Short Box with 4x4 option, the restoration was completed by the very talented JD Lusardi at Street Rod Factory in Mountain Home, Idaho, a builder with Riddler Award winning involvement in his history. According to the owner and JD, no stone was left unturned in this frame-off restoration. Now sporting a rebuilt LS V8 and rebuilt 4L60e automatic transmission, the truck now has the power needed to feel like a modern sports truck. Everything underneath was powder coated and polished where possible to create a beautiful show piece. A Rough Country 4 inch lift was installed to better fit the white lettered 33” tires, which are wrapped on 18” Detroit Steel Smoothie wheels. These wheels are retrofitted to fit the factory dog dish hubcaps for the true vintage look. Looking around the exterior, the Chevrolet Victory Red color may have never looked so good with lots of clear coat sprayed on top, sanded and polished as best as possible. An all new bed and floor were installed to insure no filler or rust, and every piece of chrome is new on top of that.\nInside, the all new interior features a beautiful leather wrapped bench seat, dash cover and door cards. To keep it still vintage style, the builders opted for keeping the manual crank windows and leaving the headlight dimmer switch on the floor. Modern touches such as a retro looking radio with Bluetooth, Dakota Digital retro looking gauge cluster with LED displays, and Vintage Air keep the ride comfortable and modern. Whether you are looking for a show truck or one to enjoy, this K10 4x4 is an excellent option for either.\n \nRestoration Highlights Include:\nRebuilt 2005 LS V8\nReworked Heads with Larger Valves and Stiffer Springs\nLarger Camshaft\nNew Water Pump\nNew Oil Pump\nRebuilt 4L60E Transmission\nFlowmaster Mufflers\nRebuilt Transfer Case\nNew Front and Rear Axles - 3:73 Ratio\nNew Vintage Air System\nDakota Digital Gauges\nAnd Much More\n \nVIN:  CS140Z160860\nMileage Shown at Listing:  28\n \nPlease contact us with any questions, for more information or a shipping quote.\n"}

One of the most significant show cars built in this era of the Ghia-Ford relationship is the Megastar. With a very exaggerated \"greenhouse\" feel on the outside and inside with amazing visibility, the sides of the car are 80% glass! Aerodynamics were in full effect with a wedge shape, low centre of gravity and round smooth sides, this was the beginnings of the modern supercar age where this shape defined the futuristic supercars of the era. It certainly was influenced by a few previous Italian designs such as the 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo concept by Bertone, the Ferrari P5 and P6 by Pininfarina and of course Ghias own DeTomaso Mangusta and Pantera designs. Based on the Ford Granada chassis, the Megastar is powered by a pretty powerful 3 liter V6 and an automatic transmission for comfort. It even has dual exhaust that has a pretty aggressive tone. The inside certainly has an Italian feel with a leather wrapped dash and Italian sport steering wheel, but the shapes are very futuristic with a mid-century twist with square shaped gauges and a mechanical analog clock smack center of the dash. Four color keyed bucket style seats with very defined futuristic cushions give it a very spaceship feel. Originally upon its completion, the Megastar was revealed at the 1977 Geneva motor show where I am sure it gained some big attention. It was also shown at the 1978 Chicago auto show on the Ford stand. From then on the Megastar disappeared into the storage facilities of the Ford Motor Company. Now on offer for the first time and in fully serviced running and driving condition. Contact us today for more information\n"}

The B introduced new front and rear sheet-metal, while retaining the curved front trunk lid and rounded fenders of the A series. The B also added some features requested by American customers, such as raised front and rear bumpers with over-riders to better protect the body from parking incidents. The headlamps were raised, a larger hood handle was added, and front vent windows appeared in the doors. A new steering wheel and column similarly refreshed the interior, along with redesigned rear seats.\nThe 356 B also reflected Porsche’s continuing effort to improve the line’s mechanical components, with stronger engine internals, transaxle, shifting linkage, and better Alfin brakes. The “Super” model with raised compression added an extra 15 brake horsepower to the standard version’s 1.6-liter, air-cooled, flat, four-cylinder engine.\nThe magnificent, one family-owned 1963 Porsche 356 B 1600 Super Cabriolet featured here is finished in gorgeous Heron Gray (Off-White) over Black leather with a Black folding convertible top. This stunning 356 B 1600 Super was delivered new on November 14, 1962 to Porsche Car Pacific in Burlingham, California to its original owner who cared for it for many years until passing it down to his son, who would later decide to commission Porsche expert Dick Highland to perform a show quality, no expense spared multi-year restoration before showing it at the 2018 New York International auto show. This car was also featured in a Porsche-commissioned IFC short film (LINK HERE) as well as shown at many Concours events. We are proud to offer this investment-grade Porsche to the most sophisticated investor, collector, or enthusiast who aspires to own one of the best!\n"}

Beginning production in 1953 with the iconic 100-4, Austin Healeys 4 cylinder model which proved to be extremely popular for both road and racing purposes. After a while Donald Healey just couldn't squeeze any more power out of his trusty Austin 4 cylinder so he upgraded to a straight six cylinder overhead valve Austin unit with twin SU H6 carburetors producing 130 horsepower, a huge upgrade from the previous 4 cylinder engine. The 100-6 proved to be extremely popular becoming the basis for the iconic 3000 to follow and the rest was history.\nOffered here is a wonderful 1958 100-6 that is really sharp in its Florida Green and Old English White color combination. It’s overall condition is really nice with very nice paint and very nice black interior accented with white piping. The white wire wheels are also really sharp wrapped in Dunlop tires. Mechanically it runs really well and it drives great. If you are looking for a great 100-6 than this Florida Green and white Healey should certainly be considered.

The name \"Hudson\" came from Joseph L. Hudson, a Detroit department store entrepreneur and founder of Hudson's department store, who provided the necessary capital and gave permission for the company to be named after him. \nHudson caused great excitement to the U.S. auto industry with its new “step-down” unibody in 1948. The unibody made the Hudson Commodore lighter and stiffer than more conventional designs, and also reduced weight, all of which meant the cars were actually quite capable. The new design was aerodynamic and surprisingly fast and set the car apart from most everything else on the road.\nComing to us from a well-known Hudson collector, RB Collection is pleased to offer this rare, desirable, and meticulously restored 1949 Hudson Commodore Convertible Brougham Model equipped with a Super Eight 254-cid, 128-hp straight-eight engine, VIN 494153232, with an attractive Roman Red paint over an exquisite burgundy leather interior and convertible top.    \nThe low center of gravity and powerful eight-cylinder engines made Hudson’s some of the best-performing postwar cars and they have become collectors' favorites. This 1949 Hudson Commodore 8 convertible is a perfect example of the appeal of these cars. Powered by the 128hp 254 cubic inch eight-cylinder engine, it has been thoroughly restored to pristine condition with excellent paint, a gorgeous interior, sharp chrome, and a thoroughly prepared and cleanly presented engine compartment. It has a 3-speed manual transmission, hubcaps, trim rings, wide whitewalls, rear wheel fender skirts, power windows, radio, heater, power top, grille guard, and the original Owner’s Manual.\nWe are very pleased to offer this outstanding example with exceptional restoration as a rare opportunity of acquiring a vehicle that represents American history.

Less than ten thousand Citations were built, and this restored example is finished in the factory Frost White and gold and is complimented by cloth upholstery in the same colors. The car features a Teletouch push-button actuated automatic transmission found on the center of the steering wheel. Other features include a rotating carousel-style speedometer, along with other amenities such as power windows. Mechanically, the car is equipped with coil spring front suspension and a four-barrel carburetor. The five-digit odometer shows 79,038 miles, but the actual mileage is unknown. It is located in Englewood, Colorado\nThe third-party photos and inspection represent well the condition of this Edsel. The car was restored by the owning family around 2007, and the condition is evident in the photos. Further restoration photos are available. The exterior white paint shows typical scratches and chips that one would expect on a car of this age. Small spots of surface rust can be seen on the interior and exterior of the vehicle, and the car’s power steering has limited functionality. The interior of the car is a matching two-tone white and gold with the hallmarks of fifties styling. Some wear on the dash and minor wear in the upholstery are evident, and there is also a crack in one of the lower shrouds of one of the seats, and the radio does not currently function. Mechanically, the car runs and drives as intended by the manufacturer. The car is in overall good condition and still reflects the older restoration performed. The original owner’s manual and one set of keys are included in the sale. \n \nThis Edsel is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Englewood, CO.\n \nAbout the model\nThe Edsel Citation was a family of full-size cars that debuted for the 1958 model year. The Citation was offered in two-door hardtop, four-door hardtop, and two-door convertible body styles and was Edsel's flagship model. This family of rear-wheel drive cars was powered by a 6.7L V8 engine paired with a three-speed manual transmission. Due to Edsel's commercial failure, the Citation was only offered for the 1958 model year before being discontinued, with a total of 9,299 examples made.\n \nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nOwnership History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n"}

This American muscle car is powered by a Ram-Air 400ci V8 engine with the last six digits of the VIN matching the last six of the engine block stamping. Power from the V8 runs through a Muncie four-speed manual transmission to the rear wheels. The car was sold new at Star Pontiac of Washington D.C. and still wears the correct Starlight Black (10A) paint with an Ivory white convertible top and matching Parchment (257) white vinyl upholstery. This GTO was equipped with front power disc brakes along with power windows and steering. Other features include the hood-mounted tachometer and Endura front bumper. The car was the recipient of a frame-off restoration by a previous owner at an unknown date. It is currently in Warren, New Jersey.\nThe quality of the restoration performed on this vehicle is evident in the third-party photos and inspection. The black paint is deep and shows well in the photos. The hideaway headlights and power top both function as they should. The Rally wheels are also in good condition, but the next owner will need to monitor the tread depth of the tires. The Parchment colored interior has no rips or wear, and the dash shows no cracks. The teak wood three-spoke steering wheel is also in good restored condition. The inspection report includes a video of the engine idling smoothly, and a test drive revealed the vehicle to be in good working order.   \nThis Pontiac GTO is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Warren, New Jersey.\nFinancing options are available through our recommended lenders.

One of the most notable GTO variants were cars fitted with The Judge package, that was a stripped GTO made to compete with the Plymouth Road Runner.

They were functional, tough, and always had the needed accessories to pull off the rescue or get-a-way.\nBlack Horse Garage is proud to represent this adventure truck, a 1972 Chevrolet K20 pickup.\nFor this truck, Black Horse Garage drew inspiration from the action TV series “The Fall Guy’. While its not the same make or color as that one, we were looking for a similar feel. This K 20 has been blacked out everywhere including tinting the windshield and windows. Like the Fall Guy, we added a roll bar with 8-inch KC lights, side steps, a front bully bar, and KC off-road lights.\nThat was just the beginning though. Here is a list of some improvements made and accessories added on at Black Horse Garage:\nOne of the biggest things we did was give the K20 power steering with the EZ Electric power steering kit. It makes the truck easy to drive, steer, and handles tremendously. It’s a lot of truck!\nAll action trucks have a larger than life feel and this one is no exception. It has been given a lift with a Rough Country 4-inch lift kit. Five-inch leaf spring bolts and new killer Nitto Ridge Grappler tires complete the look.\nThis K20 is a beast, so it has to sound good as well. We installed Flowmaster headers that have the most aggressive sound in the Flowmaster line. It also has a Flowmaster universal exhaust kit. The kit has cross pipes with cutouts that balance the exhaust pulses for increased torque and horsepower.\nWe had to install a 120-amp alternator to handle all the additional power needs for the Chevy truck. It has LED lights inside and out. Modern and vintage are mixed together with an Alpine Apple Play digital multimedia receiver with 7-inch touchscreen and a CB radio with whip antenna. Safety features are abundant as well with not only a back-up camera, but two side cameras with an independent viewscreen.\nThe K20 has less than 39k miles on it. It is powered by a Chevy 350, 5.7 -liter V-8 engine with a 4-barrel carburetor. It has a 4-speed manual transmission and is a 4×4.\nIf you would like to make an appointment to see this 1972 Chevrolet K20 in person, please call or text 203-947-5293 or send an email to \n"}

The car is finished in Burgundy (N-N) over a Black (223) interior and came equipped with a WT code 389, 4-speed transmission, and 3.55 rear end. The car is PHS documented and received a GM Award of Excellence at Carlisle in 2010 shortly after the restoration was completed.\nThe car is the result of a frame-off rotisserie restoration and it is drop-dead gorgeous. The bodywork on the car is very straight, and the gaps on the GTO are tight and nice throughout. The glass is all in very good condition and was replaced during the restoration. All of the chrome is new and all of the stainless is either new or restored. All of the rubber seals on the car were done as well at the time of the restoration. Overall, it’s a beautiful show car.\nWhile the body was off the frame, the frame was stripped to bare metal and refinished in the proper GM satin black. All the suspension and steering components were replaced as well including all of the bushings, tie rods, ball joints, and brake components. The steering gearbox was also upgraded to a quicker ratio 12:1 unit.\nThe interior is all redone and looks crisp. The dash has the factory tach, and the car is equipped with a factory console and push-button radio. All soft panels are new including the seat covers, door panels, carpets, carpet underlayment, headliner, dash, and package tray.\nThe engine was cast on March 10th, 1966 and the engine casting number is 9778789. It’s important to note that GM did not stamp VIN codes on these motors until late 1967, so calling them \"matching numbers\" would not be the correct usage of the term. What we can say about this car is that the engine was cast a few months before the build date of the car and that it is a WT code that matches the PHS docs we have with the car. During the restoration, a Tri-Power setup was added to the car, however, the correct 4bbl intake, carb, and air cleaner have been retained with the GTO. The GTO is equipped with the correct 4-speed wide ratio transmission and YH safety track 3.55 gears.\nThe car runs very well, is properly tuned, and is a blast to drive. With the faster ratio power steering and power brakes, it’s also easy to maneuver, and with the 3.55 gears, you get a good balance of quick acceleration and easy highway cruising.\nFor the GTO nut wanting a PHS documented, drop-dead gorgeous Goat, this one is for you!\n"}

Wikipedia details only 1560 Grand Wagoneers rolled off the Toledo assembly line in 1991 and whilst other sources quote slightly higher final year production numbers, still 1991 is the lowest production year as Chrysler ended production on June 21th, 1991. A fresh new color was added to the line and it would only be produced in the final year – HUNTER GREEN METALLIC. This unique color would be selected to represent the Grand Wagoneer in the Chrysler Museum and the last Grand to complete on that final day was also a Hunter Green model. Even from the start the factory execs knew this was one beautiful color contrasting with the wood tone applique. How rare are these? The most often quoted production number is 150 – that number could be plus or minus a few – but you get the idea- they are really rare. Few vehicles in modern automotive history have been produced in such limited numbers. Each time we acquire a ’91 Hunter Green Grand Wagoneer we feel quite fortunate that we have the opportunity to restore one to its original glory. This is truly a Benchmark vehicle for the discerning collector . Industry experts predict that Grand Wagoneers will continue to appreciate in the coming years and that 1991 models will be at the forefront of that appreciation- especially the rare Hunter Green edition.\nThis investment grade Final Edition was just a two owner piece until our acquisition and apart from our purchase, the only state shown on the Carfax is the southern state of Arkansas. Her former owners cherished this Grand and past down from one to the other was the original window sticker. ($30,289.00 was the sticker price, if your are curious). The 147,200 miles are shown as actual (still under 5,000 miles per year) with no accidents reported against her.\nThe frame off restoration is extensive, from a newly remanufactured original spec 360ci V8 engine, rebuilt transmission to a whole host of other cosmetic and mechanical/electrical works with the highlights detailed below:\nOUR FRAME OFF RESTORATION PROCESS\nExterior cosmetic restoration works:\nInterior cosmetic restoration works:\nElectrical/mechanical works:\nEngine:\nModern fuel injection includes:\nTransmission & 4 wheel drive systems\nAir conditioning & coolant systems\nBraking, wheel components & undercarriage\nKey electrical components & parts replaced\nOur entire focus is on Grand Wagoneers and we know these unique vehicles inside and out. When you purchase a Classic Gentleman Wagoneer it has been thoroughly inspected and works completed by professional mechanics, some with over forty years of Wagoneer experience. We purchase fine example Jeeps from a variety of sources including other dealers and private parties. We are often told by the seller, “My Jeep is excellent and needs nothing” however, being in this profession, we know to expect and plan for a great deal of sorting. Remember the average age of these vehicles is over thirty years old and even with loving care many the cosmetics and mechanical parts have aged and worn accordingly. When a Classic Gentleman Grand Wagoneer arrives at your home, it is a special occasion and the Grand will be in beautiful condition. Yes, our sales are as-is, but as you will see from our detailed document files that your Grand has been looked after carefully. Our goal is to see that the joy and enthusiasm of Grand Wagoneer ownership begins immediately with your purchase and that it will be there for years to come.\nBe sure to have a look at our website’s recommendation page where you can see first hand the positive experiences of a worldwide assortment of named buyers. We deal honestly and work hard to insure a happy buyer. You will never be chased for a sale but given all the time needed to insure if a purchase is right for you.

Extra care was taken to clean the car before stripping to uncover factory stencil and paint markings so that they could be replicated after paint. All gaps are extremely good and body panels are straight, paint is fully sanded and buffed. The undercarriage has the correct oxide sealer finish and the trunk is spatter painted as original. \n  The interior was restored in the cars correct Fawn color with factory correct materials throughout. All gauges were rebuilt or replaced and all function properly. The factory original Sun Tach is mounted on the column. The AM radio works as do the wipers, blinkers, etc. This is a very well sorted car. \n  The original 409 engine was fully balanced and rebuilt with forged TRW 11.1 pistons and upgraded stainless valves. In 2017 the next owner after restoration upgraded the cam to a Comp Cams 48-000-5 and added roller rockers, HD springs, and titanium locks and retainers to strengthen the top end.

Not only is this truck a short bed and a mainly original example of this generation of F series, but it is also representative of the time that it is from with its retro color scheme and its different memorabilia and gadgets.\n            It is difficult to find a truck like this in clean condition, which can be explained by the fact that this truck has been in storage for nearly 40 years. The truck is a real time capsule as it still sports its inspection sticker from 1984 as well as a city of Chicago and town stickers from the same year. Other vintage decals include NRA stickers on either side window and a hunting club the owner must have been a part of back in the early 1980’s. These pieces of memorabilia pair well with its groovy Turtle Top color scheme and the fact that this truck still sports its original sheet metal.\n            Going along with the theme of originality, is that this truck still features its original powertrain. This F150 is powered by a 351 V8 engine that sends power to an automatic transmission making for a comfortable yet exciting driving experience. The truck rolls along on its original turbine style wheels that are wrapped around by BF Goodrich all-terrain tires. Another notable feature about the exterior of this truck is that it is the desired short bed configuration with the bed coated in Line-X for durability and is in great shape. Up front the truck wears a bull bar that is outfitted with a pair of fog lights.\n            Moving inside, this truck’s original shag carpet interior pairs well with the Turtle Top exterior, which really completes this truck’s nostalgic look and really makes you feel like you are back in the 70’s when driving this vehicle around. Other cool features inside the truck are a Cobra CB radio, tilt wheel, and air conditioning. The headliner and carpeting are in great shape and the seats are overall in pretty good shape with some signs of wear and tear that is expected from an over 40-year-old vehicle.\n            Overall, if you are looking for a truck that will make you feel nostalgic as if you are back in the ‘70’s then this is the truck for you. Its interior and exterior color schemes are representative of the era that it is from, and the truck sports most of its original components. To bring it all together this truck features different pieces of memorabilia that are exemplary of the time it is from including its inspection and club stickers as well as its CB radio. Classic vehicles of all sorts have the ability to bring us back to a simpler time and this vehicle is surely one that will do that for you.\n"}

It is beautifully re-finished in its original Caspain Blue (74) with a proper tan leather and cloth interior, tan cloth top & boot cover with just 4,000 miles since the odometer was reset after its complete restoration.

The finish is smooth as glass including the body, jambs, and undercarriage and the alignments and fitment are outstanding. The chrome was replated, trim polished, lenses refreshed and all rubber replaced. The new top was reinstalled onto a fully restored frame and fits beautifully.

Even the frame and undercarriage components have been professionally powder-coated.

It is a very comfortable example even for the longest drives.\n257ci Inline-Eight was fully rebuilt, it starts easily, runs cool, and idles quietly and smoothly. The rebuilt Hydra-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission shifts at all of the proper shift points and the restored braking and suspension work as designed.

Under the hood was a 4.4 L Tipo F 101 AC 000 Colombo V12 engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission that put out 335 hp. Rather than a transaxle setup like the Daytona, the 5-speed transmission was bolted directly to the engine, giving the 365 GTC/4 a near-perfect 51:49 weight distribution.\nUS export models received three-point seat belts, side markers, and numerous engine modifications to comply with Federal emission standards, including air injection, a carbon, and a different exhaust system which lowered the engine output to 316 hp. Only 505 examples were built over the car’s two-year production span.\nToday, the GTC/4 stands as the more elegant and manageable younger sibling of the infamous Daytona. With a dramatically more street-worthy nature, the GTC/4 has the looks of the much pricier Daytona while being far more pleasant and comfortable to use on a daily basis. Pricing on the GTC/4 has been very solid over the last 5 years while continually trending in a positive direction. Having driven both extensively, we feel that the GTC/4 is overall undervalued given the fantastic V12 experience it provides in addition to its timeless good looks, and we see ample room for increased future value.\nThis particular example, 101AC101147745, was delivered in 1971 to its initial owner in Crepaldi, Italy, finished in metallic blue with a tan leather interior. It was later transported to the US, where it was offered for sale by Ferrari of Los Gatos in Los Gatos, CA, in 1978 and again in 1988 with a reported 18,875 miles on the odometer.\nThe car was then purchased by a new owner out of New York and repainted black, and later that same year, it was yet again offered for sale by Berlinetta Motorcars in Huntington Station, NY. Two years later, in 1990, the Ferrari was offered for sale by Tim Stanford Foreign Cars out of Fort Lauderdale, FL, with a reported 19,500 miles on the odometer. It remained in Florida for the next three years, where it was offered for sale by the same owner in 1991, 1992, and 1993 before it eventually exchanged hands in 1993 with 19,847 miles on the odometer.\nFollowing a six-year ownership in Miami, FL, this GTC/4 was offered for sale in 1999 to a fellow Floridian who owned the car for the next seven years. It made its way to Motorcar Gallery in Fort Lauderdale, FL, on July 2006 and was reportedly freshly serviced before being listed. It was purchased in August by it’s next owner out of Mars, PA, who continued owning the car for the next five years.\nThe Ferrari made its rounds on eBay in late 2011 and early 2012. It was described as having undergone a bare metal Rosso Cordoba respray with a new Interior, re-chromed trim, engine detail, freshened camshaft by Web Cam Inc, rebuilt carburetors, starter, alternator, AC system, and brake booster. Sometime in mid to late 2012, it was purchased by its next owner out of Charlotte, NC, which is when the service records on file begin.\nThroughout this ownership, the car was mostly serviced at Automotive International of Charlotte, NC. In August of 2012, it received a brake system flush, cleaned wiper assembly, as well as some minor interior electrical repairs. It returned in October of the same year for further minor services that included an inoperative heat fan and a broken fuel enrichment system. A new window switch and lighter plug were installed along with new headlamps in August of 2013 by the same shop. A new ignition coil was installed in June 2014 to correct an intermittent ignition issue, and new engine mounts were also installed.\nThe passenger wiper was repaired in March of 2015 due to a broken wiper arm post shaft, the voltage regulator was rebuilt, and the rear right wheel bearing was replaced. In May of 2015, new ignition boxes were installed along with the corresponding wiring and ignition coils. A couple of small holes in an exhaust were repaired as well.\nThe car would exchange hands again in 2018, where it ended up with its current owner and consignor, who is a good friend and enthusiast. Being very knowledgeable about the workings of cars, he completed a number of maintenance items on his own, which included having the brake booster and master cylinder rebuilt, replacing the spark plug wires with factory-correct ones, replacing the fuel and vacuum hoses, balancing and tuning the carbs, and replacing the fluids and oil in 2020 then again in 2022\nAs it sits, this is a well-sorted and very correct example of one of Ferrari’s most underrated V12 grand touring machines. High-speed and long-distance driving are what this car was built for, and its lengthy service history will allow its future owner to enjoy it to its full potential.\nUpon purchase, the new owner will receive the original toolkit, owner’s manual, and all service and history records on file. In addition, we are working on getting a Massini report for the car, which will be uploaded to the listing and included in the sale as well.\nPlease visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

We are taking a look at that and should be able to address it.\nThis is an honest, nice-driving California bus that could be enjoyed as-is or driven while restoring.

It boasted an aluminum head with a different shaped combustion chamber and rocker arms attached to the rocker cover instead of to the head itself. The Electra Glide was a serious long distance tourer with a top speed just under 100 mph. A front disc brake was a welcome addition in 1972 and even at a hefty 738lbs the quarter mile time was a decent 15.42 seconds. The first Classic FLH appeared in 1977. This particular example has 20,474 original miles and has been completely gone through within the last 4 years and 4,000 miles. The engine was completely rebuilt during which time it was bored .030 over. During the same time it received all new lines and cables. It was repainted in a gorgeous Metallic Green about 10 years ago and it still shows great. Within the last 2 years it received new spoked wheels with wide whitewalls, new chrome 12” bars, new brake calipers and rotors, new fork seals, new bearings and a variety of new chrome covers. It is fed via an S&S carb and it sounds incredible ripping through its newer performance exhaust. It has been serviced every 1,000 miles since being rebuilt and everything is working as it should. In the last 4 years close to $15k has been spent on rebuilding and reconditioning this beauty yet we are barely asking half of that. It is priced fairly so if you like this bike reach out before someone else beats you to it!\n"}

Originally built for World War II, the Jeep has always been built with ruggedness in mind to go over any terrain. Over the decades there have been many generations, but the overall boxy look has mainly stayed the same. This rings true for the Civilian Jeeps or more commonly known as CJ’s. The CJ-7 was produced from 1976-1986, and it is a good mix between the iconic Jeep look and the overall rounded and curvy design of many cars from the 70’s.\nThis 1984 example is representative of that design and is in beautiful stock condition. Hailing from out west, this vehicle has spent most of its life out in California and Nevada, which can help explain why this vehicle is so clean. Along with that, this vehicle has been comprehensively restored. Finished in a beautiful blue this color pairs well with the Laredo decals that run along the body of the vehicle. This Jeep also comes with a removable black hardtop that has also been refinished.\nThis CJ is powered by a fuel injected 4.2L inline 6-cylinder engine that drives power to a 5-speed manual Borg-Warner T5 transmission. The vehicle sits at stock ride height and wears factory CJ-7 wheels that are wrapped around by 31” Toyo Open Country all-terrain tires. A matching spare wheel and tire sits on the tailgate. This vehicle’s stock condition makes it easy to drive and the fuel injected engine paired with 5-speed manual transmission gives you a simple and reliable yet fun driving experience.\nMoving to the interior, one will see a pair of front bucket seats separated by a locking center console. Sitting in front of the gear and transfer case shifter are a few different gauges. On the floor are a pair of Bestop floor mats, and out back is a nice bench seat for two. This simple interior is commonplace among Jeeps from this era.\nThis vehicle is perfect for someone who is looking to buy a stock Jeep CJ in excellent condition. Its beautiful blue exterior pairs well with the Laredo badging that fit the body lines of this CJ well, and its stock condition makes this Jeep fun and simple to drive.

It is powered by a 2.2L flat-six engine that sends power to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle. A bright shade of green covers the exterior, and it is contrasted with beige leather upholstery and black carpets. The car is equipped with Zenith carburetors, head restraints, a collapsable Targa roof panel, fog lamps, and a new AC system from Straat. This well-documented vehicle has been under the same ownership since 2016 and received a restoration in 2021. The car's five-digit odometer reads 69,743 miles, but the total mileage is unknown. It is located in Miami, Florida.\nThe recent restoration of the interior and re-paint of the exterior of this 911 show well in the third-party photographs and inspection. The car's green paint is in excellent condition after a glass out respray of the original color. The car retains its original sheet metal. The re-trimmed interior carpets and upholstery are without blemish, and the dash is without cracks. The new AC system is reported to work as designed, and the sound system functions as it should. Mechanically, the car is sound, thanks to a mechanical restoration by Klub Sport Racing in 2016. Recent receipts show service to the shifter and carburetors to ensure the car is running as intended. Included in the sale of the vehicle is a detailed log of repairs, oil changes, fuel refills, and tire purchases from the original owner dating from 1971-1986. Additional information about, and receipts from the recent restoration performed by Carparc in California are also included. The tool kit, jack, owner's manual, and spare tire are also still with the car. \nThis Porsche 911 is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Miami, FL.\nAbout the model\nThe Targa version of the 1971 Porsche 911T 2.2 Liter was introduced in 1970. These semi-convertible sports cars were powered by a 2.2L naturally aspirated flat-six engine that sent 125hp to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual or 4-speed semi-automatic transmission. In production until 1971, the Porsche 911T 2.2 Liter Targa was replaced by the Porsche 911T 2.4 Liter.\nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nOwnership History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n"}

This is not just because of its good looks. Before that, you had two beautiful convertibles: the 190SL and the 300SL Gullwing.\nThe result is a beautiful design without any fuss. The roof was given a safe ‘roll-proof’ construction that rose at the sides. With this design, it was somewhat akin to an Oriental building; a Pagoda. Voila, a ‘spitz name’ was born for this beautiful SL, and later became a legend. Design and engineering came together in a cruiser that screamed to cruise around elegantly in a timeless classic.\nYou know us a bit by now, and know that we are always looking for something nice, something extra. Ours is an original American-made manual transmission Mercedes 250 SL. This one has been neatly restored and fully documented, just the way you want it!\nWe ourselves are still amazed at how modern this ‘Sixties-Lovely’ drives.

One important update was the ladder-type, steel-reinforced frame was “stiffened” in an effort to reduce body shake and vibration.  A second was a production tooling change that opened up the inner door panels a half-inch per side, allowing occupants additional shoulder space.   The base engine became the 300 horsepower 350 cubic inch V-8.   Near the top of the optional engine list was the L71 427.  A $290.40 upgrade that got you 435 horsepower with triple holley carburetors. The only higher up the chain a buyer could go was the L88/L89 engines intended for racing.\nMost people associate the name Yenko with the 427 Camaro/SCs, 427 Chevelle/SCs, and 427 Nova/SCs, but the Canonsburg, Pennsylvania's Yenko Chevrolet was very proud to be the Greater Pittsburgh area's only \"authorized\" High Performance Corvette dealer back in the late 60s. Throughout the 1960s, Don and Frank Yenko routinely ran ads in the Pittsburgh Press proudly announcing \"Buy Your Corvette at Yenko Corvette Center,\" and they sold a lot of performance Corvettes.  This very special car was one of those.\nA copy of the tank sticker on file verifies other important details about this car. Built in March 1969, this highly original Daytona Yellow 1969 Corvette is one of 2,722 produced with the L71 427/435 HP Tri-Power engine, in this case mated to a 4-speed manual transmission and optional 4.11:1 gearing to draw full peak horsepower from the big-block V-8. At just more than 40,000 original miles, it retains most of its original Daytona Yellow paint and the original black interior complete with tilt-telescopic steering column, tinted glass and Delco AM/FM radio. Proudly displaying Yenko badges on the hood and tail panel, it retains its transistor ignition, chrome luggage rack, bright fender louver trim and Rally wheels with Whitewall tires.\nA very original car with lots of unique details.  For example, the correct Tri-Power Smog Pump which was an exclusive to the Tri-Power cars. Original clear tape on the headlight wiring loom-the vacuum headlights and parking lights all function like new-having the correct black paint \"cut line\" in the engine compartment at the firewall tip of each fender.  Also the original NOS F70x15-inch Firestone white striped bias ply tires, 15x8-inch Rally wheels, four-clip beauty rings and correct hubcaps all point to this car being totally original.\nHistorically, this Corvette L71 has \"been seen around\" the Greater Pittsburgh area for most of its fifty years.  In 1981 it was owned by Harry Statowitz in indianola. By the early 2000s it was in the hands of Larry Tenorovich.  In 2006 it was purchased by a New Florence, Pennsylvania, Corvette collector named Bob Priest.  Priest had performed a basic engine rebuild on the original date code (\"LT\") 427 big-block, 4.251-inch bore and 3.76-inch stroke, and cast-iron square-port \"L71\" big-block cylinder heads, using the original stock GM components.   In late 2007 Brian Henderson bought the car.  A Pennsylvania native, Brian  is co-owner of one of the most successful muscle car restoration shops in the country, Latrobe, Pennsylvania's Super Car Workshop.  The car was purchased by the current owner in 2016.\nThe car has recently been sorted and its triple Holley 2 barrels have been rebuilt and tuned.   It represents a very rare opportunity to purchase a documented Yenko delivered L71 427/435 Corvette in outstanding original condition.\n"}

This pony car is painted in the factory-correct Prairie Bronze and complemented by the Palomino beige vinyl interior. Additional factory features include a set of Rally Pac gauges, convertible top, power brakes, 3.00:1 rear-end gears, A/C, and a period-correct radio. This early 1965 Mustang still uses the original style generator and appears to have early-style body panels unique to this era. The original speedometer, glove box door, air cleaner, and valve cover have all been swapped out in favor of newer parts to improve functionality. The odometer reads 70,608 miles, but the true mileage is unknown. This Mustang is located in California. \nThe third-party photos and inspection show a well-cared-for Mustang. The gold-colored exterior is in good condition, with minor chips, and the interior shows only minor wear to the dash, inner door panels, and the headliner. The car is said to be in good operating condition, including a new convertible top window. Included in the sale is a full-size spare and one set of keys.\n \nThis Mustang is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Newbury Park, CA.\n \nAbout the model\nThe first generation Ford Mustang was built in one of three body styles; hardtop (notchback), fastback, or convertible. The Ford Mustang was first launched as an unofficial 1964-1/2 model. These \"1964-1/2\" Mustangs were available with an inline six, a 260 cubic inch V8, or the 289 cubic inch V8. Upon the 1965 Mustang's official introduction, new engines became available. Depending on the engine used, these cars were available with a 3-speed manual, a 4-speed manual, or a 3-speed automatic transmission, all of which sent drive to the rear wheels. For the 1967 model year, Ford updated the Mustang, which resulted in the 1967-1968 First Generation Ford Mustang. \nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nOwnership History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n"}

Featuring an all metal body and V-8 engine, unlike Chevrolets 6 cylinder fiberglass Corvette, the T-Bird was built for sporty good looks, but also for comfort. For the 1957 model year, Thunderbird sales increased dramatically with an all new cosmetic design and performance options. Featuring an extended tail end by 6 inches, a new grille and bumpers, the 1957 T-Bird is considered by many to be the most beautiful of all the two seat Thunderbirds. Mechanically, you were able to upgrade the performance by ordering either the E-Code or F-Code engines. The E-Code is an incredible and very rare option increasing the horsepower by a lot. The E-Code features dual four barrel Holley carburetors, increased bore and stroke, higher compression ratio and automatic choke giving the 312 cubic inch Ford Y-Block V-8 enough horsepower to beat Chevrolets fuel injected 283 V-8 by just 2 horsepower. Furthermore buyers were also able to order the performance engines with the optional 3 speed manual transmission and even further overdrive was available for an additional cost. A true performance sports car, the E-Code is one of the coolest 1950's American sports cars ever made.\nOffered here is one of the finest and rarest examples of an original 1957 Ford Thunderbird \"E-Code\" that exists today. Owned by a gentleman here in Connecticut for many many years, this E-Bird has been cherished and very well taken care of. Besides being a true E-Code with the high performance \"dual quad\" engine, this E-Code is equipped with its original factory 3 speed manual transmission with factory overdrive! This is a true unicorn among Thunderbirds. On top of being such a rare bird, the restoration is wonderful having had a body off restoration some years ago with all the right details down to the firewall stampings and proper radiator hoses. Currently the car wears period chrome wire wheels and original skirts, but it also comes with its factory original steel wheels and \"dog dish\" hubcaps found only on true performance Birds. Mechanically it runs and drives incredibly well and is ready for the open road or car shows this coming spring. Contact us today for more information.\n"}

S810902DN\nThe Jaguar XK140 was a natural evolution of the famous XK120. Introduced in 1954 at Earl’s Court Motor show, the XK140 incorporated a number of changes and improvements to the earlier model. Most significantly was increased legroom and higher standard horsepower at 190, with 210 available with fitment of the optional C-Type racing head.\nThere were three different versions of the XK140. Standard cars with the 190 HP engine, single exhaust systems, disc wheels, and rear wheel covers. Next came the “Special Equipment” or SE models with the same engine, but with full dual exhaust system and knock off wire wheels. Also included were twin fog lamps and windshield washers. In the United States, this version was known as the 140M. Finally, the highest-specification SE model equipped with the C-Type head which became known as the XK140MC, as distinguished by an “S” prefix in their chassis numbers. Further, those cars equipped with the optional C-Type head were fitted with a plaque mounted on the passenger side dash, proclaiming that car as a replica of the car that had achieved 141 MPH at Le Mans.\nIn a short production window of slightly more than 2 years a total of 8,936 chassis were built in all performance variations, and made available with three different body styles. First was the DHC (drophead coupe) with roll-up windows and jump seats; next was the FHC (Fixed Head Coupe); and last was the OTS (Open Two Seat Roadster), such as the car offered here, which had no exterior door handles or windows. Open Two Seat Roadster bodies were mounted on approximately 30% of the chassis.\nThe car presented here is the most desirable version of the XK140. As verified by its JDHT Heritage Certificate it is a true XK140MC OTS Roadster, the highest-specification offered with the more desirable and sporting coachwork. Originally delivered through Max Hoffman of New York in February 1955. It is offered from a 51-year ownership, having been purchased in July 1972 from Richard Willard of Leominster Massachusetts by the current owner’s husband as a Mother’s Day gift. The car was driven regularly as a summer car through the 70s, 80 and 90s, and in 2010 the owner made the decision to change the factory colors of black with red interior to the current blue on blue which displays quite well. Currently fitted with a replacement engine A62778 with “C” Type head G2934-8S.  However, most importantly the original, rebuildable “C” head is included in the sale of the car. It is fitted with its original identification plate and body number tag.\nAlso installed on the car are chrome XKE wheels which were an aesthetic decision by the current owner; the original XK140 painted spoke wheels are also included in the sale. Recent sorting includes a tune up, brake job, fluid change and over 400 miles of driving. This car additionally comes with a soft top, tonneau cover, side curtains, owner’s manual, shop manuals, and a complete set of documentation including the aforementioned Heritage Certificate as well as invoices spanning over 50 years of ownership.\n"}

We can see a lot of recent service work done...new alternator and fuel pump, new windshield rubber seals and compression strip, new brake calipers, pads and shoes, new brake flex lines, some new metal lines, and a new battery and coil.\nTop is very good, tonneau appears to be new, carpets and dash are all in very good condition as are interior panels and seats.\nWiring looks like it has never been cut into, radiator fins are excellent as is the original cardboard radiator shroud. All signs of a properly serviced, cared for classic sports car.\nAs for the rest....lots of smooth power and torque from the 2.5 liter six cylinder engine, power assist disc brakes, the IRS offers a better ride than most other period sports cars, roomy, comfortable, ample trunk space (spare wheel is in its own compartment under the trunk floor,), and even has its original (working) AM-FM radio. Amazing, ORIGINAL radio!\nLarge diameter wheels/tires and high gearing offer comfortable highway cruising and these cars are perfect for either around town, country roads, or long distance touring. Reliable, easy to service and maintain, parts are widely available and easily accessed, and if you like the style of TRs, you will certainly enjoy this fifty two year old classic British sports car. And if you desire a racing style, we can install Minilite style alloy wheels and if you prefer a more traditional look, converting to wire wheels is easy.\n"}

The inner structure of the tub was reinforced, new “impact” bumpers with shock absorbers were integrated front and rear for a smooth appearance, a new “short-hood” look was introduced, and the doors received new internal bracing to improve side-impact resistance. The revised front trunk space now contained a single battery and a collapsible spare tire nestled over its 21-gallon fuel tank.\nThe magnificent 1974 Porsche 911 Carrera 2.7 coupe featured here is finished in highly desirable Black with rare Gold graphics over Black. This exquisite motorcar is been meticulously maintained and is among one of the finest examples we have offered in years. This 911 still retains its original engine and transmission, which, in combination with its factory color combination, makes this the perfect example to add to any premier collection. I personally believe the investment potential of this rare limited production Carrera will grow beyond your imagination offered to the most demanding collector, investor, or enthusiast who aspires to own one of the very best!\n"}

Although the XK150 fell just short of that speed, at the time it was one of the fastest production cars in the world at an impressive 135 miles per hour. Despite this minor disappointment, these cars remain absolutely stunning!\nThe XK150 is distinguished from its predecessors by the curved windscreen, which is now a single piece instead of a split window. In addition, the grille in the nose is slightly wider and the windscreen has been moved back slightly, giving the nose an even more imposing look.\nOur XK150 underwent a thorough restoration in 2002, so the car is currently in excellent condition. The beige interior evokes associations with the seats in the back rooms of Windsor Castle, and in harmony with the deep dark blue exterior, this example really makes a statement on the road. Owning a classic car like the Jaguar XK150 is a source of pride and joy for enthusiasts who appreciate the craftsmanship and attention to detail behind its creation. Whether you are looking for a solid investment or just want to experience the excitement of driving a true classic, the Jaguar XK150 undoubtedly deserves your attention.\nWhat makes our example special? Apart from its aesthetic features, this XK150 has also undergone a technical metamorphosis during its restoration. Besides a complete engine overhaul, this British beauty boasts a BMW gearbox, which only further enhances the driving pleasure.\nIn short, an ultimate gentleman sports car ready for many enjoyable miles!\n"}

The Karmann-designed 2800 CS replaced the 2000 C and CS and used a new straight-six engine dubbed the M30. The larger engine required both the wheelbase and the overall length of the car to be increased, yet the car was still lighter and more agile than the series it was replacing, weighing in at 1,420 kg (3,131 lb). The 2.8 L engine put out 168 hp through a 4-speed manual transmission. Only 276 examples of the 2800 CS were produced in 1971 out of a total of 6,283 produced over four years before the E9 range was replaced by the E24 6 Series.\nAs a follow-up to the BMW New Class line, the 2800 CS continued the automaker’s pursuit of creating sporty automobiles while retaining the luxurious feel they had come to be known for. Many of the design cues used on the 2800 CS, like the longer nose and straight-six engine, would become staples of BMW and give the car both a timeless look and modern usability in today’s traffic environment.\nToday, the 2800CS remains highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike. Thanks to their low production numbers, timeless good looks, and a high degree of useability, they have garnered a fantastic following in the collector car community. Pricing over the past 5 years has been steady with a general upward trend. We see these cars as solid investments, not very likely to pop in value but also highly unlikely to lose any value as well. They present a fantastic opportunity to purchase and use the car as intended while retaining the money invested. As is the case with any collector car, finding an example with great history and non-traditional colors is always the safest bet.\nThis particular example, Chassis # 2204412, is an extremely original example that was owned and lovingly preserved by the same family for over 50 years.\nIn that time, it has retained its original engine, much of its original paint, and all of its matching interior. It shows incredible indicators of originality, including factory stickers, inspection markings, and clamps. It was purchased new by Mr. Falk from Autos-Import S.A. of Geneva, Switzerland, in 1971 with a “Sahara” paint job and a tan woolen interior with corduroy cloth inserts. Original equipment includes power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, a rear-window defroster, and a Blaupunkt radio. The original owner passed away a short two years after purchasing the car, upon which it was passed down to his son.\nThe son continued to own and meticulously maintain the car throughout the years, often at the same dealer it was purchased from. In 1996, the BMW was imported stateside through American Lamprecht, Inc. in Lawrence, NY, and was appraised in July of that same year by a company in Rowayton, CT, with just 41,466 kilometers (25,765 miles) on the odometer. In 2001 and 2007, it was entered in the Greenwich Concours d’Elegance and won best in class in the 2001 show.\nThe meticulous service records continued, with the front brake calipers having been rebuilt in 2012 at La Jolla Independent BMW Service of La Jolla, CA. After 48 years of ownership, the son listed the BMW for sale on Bring a Trailer, where it was purchased by our client and current consignor.\nServices under its new owner began in 2021 with a new tailpipe installed at European Auto Center Repair in Norwalk, CT. In May of 2021, the car underwent a major service at Sports Car Restoration in Plainville, CT, that would last through October of that same year and total almost $20,000. During that time, it received new ignition wires, a new distributor cap, a new rotor, new fuel and coolant hoses, new carburetor chokes, a valve cover gasket, a rebuilt speedometer, odometer, and turn signals, some electric window repairs, and a replacement transmission. The transmission was replaced due to excessive grinding in the original gearbox. A used ZF S5-16 Four-Speed gearbox, in great condition, was sourced and installed, and the original was kept and will be included with the sale of the vehicle. The exterior, interior, underbody, and engine bay were also thoroughly cleaned and degreased during the service and areas at risk of rust were coated in a preventative wax coating.\nIn November of 2022, the car visited Rennsport Automotive in Bedford Hills, NY, for new fluids as well as new spark plugs, distributor points, condenser, cap, and rotor. The valve cover gasket was also replaced alongside new V belts and a power steering filter.\nAs it sits, following the numerous services it underwent in the past two years, this BMW 2800 CS is now a turnkey time-capsule example ready to take on anything from twisty roads to more concour shows. With largely original paint, an incredible original interior, all of the original equipment and accessories, and just ~30,000 original miles on the odometer, this rare German saloon with only one family ownership for 50 years is the pinnacle of automotive preservation. \nUpon purchase, the new owner will receive the original purchase agreement, all of the importation documents and service records going back to new, manufacturer’s literature, 1970s first aid kit and roadside assistance kit,  tools, spare parts, and upholstery fabric, a GPS unit, a radar detector, and a BMW car cover.\nPlease visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

After the 300 SL was introduced, an American Mercedes importer noticed that many people were interested, but that the 300 SL was too expensive for what most wanted to spend on a weekend car. After a phone call with Germany, everything accelerated; later that year the 190 SL (based on the Ponton) appeared at the New York show. A year later, the production version was ready in Geneva. Remarkably, not as a sports car, but as a comfortable two-seater. This became a great success, from 1955 to 1963 more than 25.000 cars were produced in Germany.\nOur 190 SL is from 1961, when smoking and ivory were still very normal, and was brought to the Netherlands in 1994. There the car remained in the family until 2019, after which it went to a Dutch collector. This collector decided to thin out his collection and now we were able to add the 190 to ours.\nThe 190 SL is in good condition, and it even participated in the historic Zolder Grand Prix twice. Not for racing, fortunately, because it was never meant for that, but for strolling. If you want to enjoy yourself comfortably in the direction of Italy or just along the beach in the Netherlands without having to participate in every traffic light race, then this is the car for you! You don’t have to prove anything with this car because, 190 SL.\nPure class. Any way you look at it – Mercedes 190 SL\n"}

It dominated USRRC and SCCA circuit racing, and was an increasingly persistent thorn in Ferrari’s side in international competition. In 1965, it finally broke the Italian marque’s stranglehold over GT racing by winning the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.\nWith the fearsome acceleration offered by a powerful V8 in a compact chassis, it was even well suited to drag racing. In 1963, a small band of employees persuaded Carroll Shelby to sanction the development of a drag-racing package. Among other upgrades, four stages of tune were offered for the 289ci engine, producing anything from 270hp to 380hp.\nThe famous Dragonsnake was born.\nOnly five factory 289ci Dragonsnakes were built, but other CSX Shelby Cobras were converted to Dragonsnake spec by independent privateers who could buy the package from Shelby when new.\nThe Cobra made to dominate the drag strip did just that in the 1960s\n‍\nThe goods:\nThe story goes that after a few employees at Carroll Shelby's small car company created a drag-strip-focused version of the Cobra on their own time, Shelby approved a tiny production run of this quarter-miler called the Dragonsnake. Not legal to drive on the street, they could be ordered from the factory or customers could have their Cobras fitted with Dragonsnake components like a chrome roll bar, new tachometer, revised rear fender flares to fit fat drag slicks on American Racing wheels, and sliding side windows. Only five left the the factory, four fitted with the 289-cubic-inch V8, one got the 427-ci monster. \nThe concept car featured here (CSX 2800) is dedicated to drag racer and NHRA champion Bruce Larson, a man the organizing body calls \"NHRA's original triple-threat Pro driver.\" In 1963, Larson drove Jim Costilow's 289 Dragonsnake to class honors at the Winternationals, Springnationals, and Indy U.S. Nationals, setting records throughout the year in the process. Larson took the Nationals again in 1964. Because Larson was working at a Chevrolet dealership when he did this, the dealership owner had Larson in a Chevy by 1966. But the Cobra had proved itself a winning race car in yet another discipline, and would keep claiming trophies into the late sixties.\nThe remaining three continuation Dragonsnakes that we are now offering for sale will start as an aluminum slab-side roadster in the CSX2000 series, meaning based on the original 289-ci chassis. The tube rails are four-inch round units, the engine is a 364-ci V8 with an aluminum block and eight Weber carbs making 500 horsepower, fed by a 14-gallon gas tank and Holley electric fuel pump. It's shifted through a Tremec five-speed manual to spur a car weighing roughly 2,100 pounds. Inside, an 8,000-rpm tach mixes with black leather seats, leather door pulls, a rearview mirror, glove box, custom shift knob, and stainless steel roll bar. Other kit includes an aluminum radiator and electric fan, rack and pinion steering, adjustable Penske shocks, 1963-style disc brakes, a custom exhaust, polished side vents and chrome bumpers, and vintage Cobra badges. The car sits on 15-inch vintage FIA wheels wearing Mickey Thompson tires sized 29 x 4.5 in front, 28 x 10.5 in back.\nEach Dragonsnake costs $750,000 before options. These Dragon Snakes are authenticated by Shelby and built under their guidance with CSX # 's reserved in the SAAC registry for each build.\n"}

This stately and elegant Bentley has been restored by world renowned Bentley and Rolls Royce Restorer Richard Gorman @ Vantage Motorworks Miami. After the restoration, Mr. Gorman sold the car to Emir Nasser of Kuwait, who added it to his magnificent car collection. Prior to the Sheiks ownership, this very special Bentley was owned by famous actor Nicholas Cage as part of his storied collection. After the late Sheikhs ownership, Cooper Classics LTD acquired the car and had the restoration refreshed by Automotive Restorations in Stratford Connecticut in 2022. During the refreshening of the restoration, we installed 4 new BF Goodrich Silvertown Whitewall tires. The total mileage is 32,689 Miles. The car appears as new inside and out despite being an older restoration and is ready to be used and enjoyed. It fires right up and everything functions as it should. The Air Conditioning blows ice cold out of the rear compartment as it should. We feel this is likely one of the finest examples in existence, and the only Flying Spur S3 Continental available for purchase at the time of this writing. A similar example was once owned by Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones in less-rare Right Hand Drive spec and was famously known as Blue Lena, which sold for over $1 million at auction. This car comes with all of its tools, including its jack, manual, build sheet, and records.\n"}

Originally a six cylinder car, with a stick shift, you could keep the car as is, or easily upgrade the suspension to a 5 lug suspension both front and rear.   We would recommend rebuilding the original engine that comes with the car, but you could also consider replacing it with a 289, 302, or even a 351 engine, and either a C-4 automatic or a T-5 manual transmission if you want to be able to spin the tires easily.  Call us if you need a different engine and/or a transmission.  All of the engine/transmission options are available separately at very reasonable prices.\nThe car looks to be an original Blue convertible, but once you do the restoration, it can be repainted to any color of your choice. The original top was Black and, but it will need some restoration to have it functioning properly again. It comes equipped with its original manual transmission, so the clutch pedal is already in place if you decide to upgrade to a T-5 or better.\nThis convertible was beautiful - see pictures of how it could look when fully restored.\nIt brought buyers into the showrooms by the thousands and Ford’s strategy worked—selling more Mustangs than ever before.\nWhen fully restored, this car will easily sell for $30,000 or more.\n\n\nThis car has a good exterior body shell, no accidents, and most all the panels are very straight and the quarters are in decent condition.  If you have body repair skills, this is a great project.\nThe frame of this Convertible is in fair condition and straight, but it will need new floor pans, rocker channels, torque boxes, and frame rail extensions.  The front frame rails look to be in good condition, which makes it a relatively easy car to restore. Dynacorn now makes a jig welded bottom half for any Mustang convertible which makes restoring convertibles much easier than it used to be.  The convertible top will need to be replaced, and the vinyl window should be changed.\nIf you have questions about how to restore this car, please contact us at MustangBeginnings and we will help all we can to make sure you have a successful restoration.\nOverall this Mustang is a great candidate for restoration.\nINTERIOR:\nAll the wiring, instrument panel, seats, etc. will come with the car but will need to be restored. \nThe car comes with all of its seats, both front and back. The door panels and dash pad are included, but you probably want new ones anyway.\n \nENGINE BAY:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe car is definitely a project but we can help where you need our help.  We can sell you any of the items you may need, like new seat covers, new carpet Etc. Please ask any questions, we know someone will receive a great project and ultimately a great Classic Mustang.\nThe Mustang has a clear title.  We will  supply you with the documents you will need to get the car licensed in your state.\n At MustangBeginnings we are here to help you make your restoration a success. \nTHERE ARE NO SURPRISES HERE, I ENCOURAGE ALL INTERESTED BUYERS TO COME SEE THE CAR FIRST IF POSSIBLE OR SEND SOMEONE HERE TO INSPECT IT. WE HAVE COMPLETED OTHER 66 MUSTANGS AND KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO COMPLETE THIS CAR. THIS IS A GOOD CAR TO START WITH. PLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS A 66 MUSTANG THAT NEEDS TO BE REBUILT INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL. \n"}

A supercharged 1.8-liter inline-four was installed along with a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and the chassis has been fitted with a lowered suspension and four-wheel disc brakes with Wilwood front calipers. The body is finished in yellow and has a black soft top, a louvered hood, fender flares, and triple windshield wipers. Other equipment includes black leather upholstery, 15” alloy wheels, a roll bar, a Moto-Lita steering wheel, burl wood trim, DJ Safety harnesses, and a JVC stereo. This modified MGB is now offered on dealer consignment with build records and photos, magazine articles featuring the car, and a California title listing the vehicle as a 1967 MG coupe.\n \nDrivetrain and chassis components from a rusted MGB GT were transferred to a donor roadster body during the aforementioned build, which was conducted under current ownership by On The Road Again Classics of Morgan Hill, California. The car was stripped to bare metal, exterior trim was removed, and Sebring-style front and rear valances, front brake-cooling ducts, and fender flares were added before a repaint in yellow. Additional details include a black soft top, a louvered hood, an enlarged mesh grille, front bumperettes, triple windshield wipers, black side mirrors, red-lens taillights, and a single exhaust outlet. Paint chips and blemishes around the car can be viewed in the photo gallery below.\n \nEight-spoke 15” alloy wheels are mounted with 205/50 Falken Azenis tires. The suspension has been lowered and modified with negative front camber, a 7/8” front sway bar, fast road springs, and heavy-duty lever-arm shocks. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with Wilwood four-piston front calipers plus vented rotors up front and Cobra units out back.\n \nThe cabin is upholstered in black leather with red piping and is accented with burl wood trim on the dash, center console, and door panels. A roll bar has been added along with a Moto-Lita steering wheel, a JVC AM/FM/cassette stereo, red DJ Safety four-point harnesses, and MG-branded rubber floor mats. The seats have headrests, and HVAC outlets are positioned to the left of the glovebox. The wood on the driver-door armrest is cracked. A battery cutoff switch is located in the trunk.\n \nSmiths white-dial instrumentation consists of a 170-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges, while an Innovate Motorsports digital air/fuel mixture display has been added in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 10k miles, which is said to represent the distance added since completion of the build. Total chassis mileage is unknown.\n \nThe replacement 1.8-liter inline-four was reportedly overbored .040” and features a nitrided crankshaft, a lightened flywheel, a high-capacity oil sump, a custom camshaft, an aluminum cylinder head, Rimflo valves, roller rocker arms, hardened lifters, a finned valve cover, and Arias forged pistons with an 8.3:1 compression ratio. A supercharger has been added along with a PerTronix electronic ignition system, a cold-air intake, and a heavy-duty radiator with dual electric puller fans. The exhaust headers flow into a stainless-steel resonator, muffler, and finisher.\n \nPower is sent to the rear wheels through a T9 five-speed manual transmission and an 8” Ford rear end with a limited-slip differential and 3.5:1 gearing.\n \nBuild photos and records are pictured in the gallery along with magazine articles featuring this vehicle.\n \nThe chassis plate shown above was installed by the current owner, and the number—GHD3L99429—is consistent with an MGB GT produced in 1966. The VIN listed on the California title bears a “67” prefix, and that document describes the car as a 1967 MGB GT coupe.\n \nVisit us at http://www.MohrImports.com for full photo and video collection. \n \nAll inspections welcome.

We are proud to present the nicest 356SC Cabriolet that has come through our doors in a very long time. This car benefitted from an extensive, in depth $155K restoration performed by marque specialists Club Sport Racing in Florida, which is documented with each and every invoice for the process.  The car was stripped to bare metal and repainted in its factory Red, and the interior was completely reupholstered with new correct materials. The interior presents as new and all the gauges work, including the clock. This is a matching numbers and colors car including both its Certificate of Authenticity and Kardex. This 356SC has perfect panel gaps, and the paint maintains a glass-like mirror finish all around. The black soft top is new and in excellent condition, with a matching black boot cover. The car benefits from a working, modern day radio. The car has driven less than 3500 miles since the restoration and was recently serviced in 2020 including a brake service and a carb tune up. This European spec 356SC starts up with ease and is a joy to drive, thanks to the matching numbers transmission and engine which were both rebuilt during the restoration in 2013-2016. The engine bay is highly detailed with all correct decals and stickers. The underside is so clean you could eat off of it, and the car has absolutely no rust anywhere. We recently re-acquired this 356SC after selling it to a fastidious 356 Collector owner after multiple years of ownership and care. This owner put about 2500 miles on the car, and had the original carburetors rebuilt by the famed 356 Carburetor Rescue, which recently announced the closing of their business. These rebuilt carburetors come in a box with the car, and the set currently installed on the car is in perfect tune. This 356SC is ready to be enjoyed by its new owner and includes Restoration Records, Period Service Records, Tool Kit + Jack, Manuals, Spare Wheel, Top Cover, and service manuals.\n"}

This Convertible is an early-production example built September 1965 before Chevrolet downrated the power numbers from 450 to 425 hp. This was believed to have been done for insurance reasons and very few cars received the 450hp designation. This particular Corvette is number 898 produced for 1966. Presented in its original color combination of Laguna Blue over Dark Blue vinyl interior. This car has a straight body with excellent gaps. The paint is show quality with very few flaws. The interior is also in excellent shape with all gauges functioning properly. The clock ticks and the AM/FM radio works. The L72 427 cubic inch engine has been professionally rebuilt with photos documenting the rebuild. When rebuilt, the engine was decked and re-stamped. Photos of the pad before the re-stamp remain with the car. It should also be noted that the date code on the heads is August 26th 1965, the date code on the carburetor is 2nd week August 1965, the date code on the engine block is August 11 1965, and the build date of the car is September 16 1965. It runs perfectly and sounds incredible. The 4 speed Muncie shifts properly and feels good. The undercarriage is in restored condition and looks very clean. The car sits on 15” knock off style wheels with Hankook Optimo radial tires. At the time of restoration, power steering was added. This Corvette has factory 4 wheel disc brakes. 2 tops are included in the sale; a Laguna Blue hardtop and a White convertible top. \nAn excellent opportunity to own a rare 1966 Chevrolet Corvette.\n \nVIN DECODE\n1 - Chevrolet\n94 - Corvette\n67 - Convertible\n6 - 1966\nS - St. Louis, MO\n100898 - Sequential number\n \nTRIM TAG DECODE\nDate - A16 - September 16, 1965\nStyle - 66 467 - 1966 Convertible\nTrim - 418BK - Dark Blue Vinyl\nBody - S301 - St. Louis Convertible Body #301\nPaint - 978AA - Laguna Blue\n \nEngine Casting Number - 3869942\nEngine Suffix - T0905IP\nEngine Casting Date - H115 (August 11, 1965)\nCarburetor Number - 3886101-3247-582 (Second Week August, 1965)\nExhaust Manifold Number - 3880828 and 3880827\nHeads - 3873858 - Date: H265 (August 26, 1965)\n \nTrades Considered!
