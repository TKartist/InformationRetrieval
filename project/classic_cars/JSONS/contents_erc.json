Naturally, the restoration has been recorded in an extensive photo report, as has the engine overhaul. After the restoration, the Porsche has only been driven for about 2000 km, which means that it is in as good as new condition. This Targa was delivered new in the United States, which means that the engine is more powerful than the European version and is also equipped with MFI (Mechanical Fuel Injection). It is powered by a matching numbers 2340cc 6-cylinder engine with a 5-speed manual transmission.\nPorsche 911T Targa Ölklappe in Pastellblau for sale\nWant to buy a Porsche 911T Targa Ölklappe?\nWe can help with transport.
