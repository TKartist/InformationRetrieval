        "description": "\u00a0\nThis is the 1936 \"Talk of Paris\" car, the beginning of the famed Figoni Streamlined Teardrop Period, an objet d'art\nThis 1936 135 Competition Disappearing Top Convertible is notable for many reasons, including its streamlined flowing objet d'art design by Joseph Figoni, with the Figoni et Falaschi patented (795.769) disappearing top, pioneered on this car (copy in car history book). It was specially ordered when new to be equally at home on a boulevard... or on a racetrack. It has a racing engine, gearbox and chassis. It is restored to 100-point level for Concours d'Elegance competition, and is the winner of numerous prestigious concours awards. But most importantly, as the premier example of 1930s French coachbuilding, this beautiful automobile can be seen and valued as fine art, with all the implications for further appreciation that the fine art market commands. Mobile art; \u201cA true movable feast for the eyes.\u201d\n\u201cThe chassis 46864 is correct in all respects\u201d\n-- Club Delahaye France Archives\nRarely do competitive racing chassis and engine and imaginative aerodynamic coachwork come together in the same car. This was Figoni et Falaschi's signature style applied to a convertible... the new flowing streamlined coachwork for which Figoni-Falaschi would become internationally famous. It most dramatically illustrates Figoni\u2019s famed streamlined creations, in this case for a wealthy Parisian named Wolf, a personal friend of Figoni\u2019s. Wolf could afford the best of the best, so he challenged Delahaye and Figoni to create a car with elegant line, fine et elanc\u00e9e, with the fast and reliable Competition 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine, and the competition chassis... bearing in mind his intent to race the car and enter in rallies, as well as concours events and various showings for Figoni.\n\u201cThis is one of the most elegant creations of Joseph Figoni\nand one of the most important Delahaye cars.\u201d\n-- Club Delahaye France Archives\nThe Delahaye Type 135 Competition long-wheelbase chassis was a factory competition special, ordered by Monsieur Wolf to satisfy his purposes of personal use, concours events and racing requirements. At Delahaye, the competition engine was placed into the rugged Type 135 Competition chassis, a durable advanced design for its time, proved in the coming years at races like the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nThis Delahaye 135 Competition Convertible has been authenticated by Club Delahaye France, and Figoni records, as the original body (Figoni # 581) and chassis (Delahaye # 46864) with all pertinent numbers on the car matching the original Figoni and Delahaye records.\nThe Competition Engine. The car is powered by a 3.5 liter (3557cc) overhead valve, 120 horsepower, inline six-cylinder Delahaye engine, foundry-marked T35 (built in 1935). It is coupled to a rugged 4-speed manual competition transmission with synchromesh on the top three gears. This car was ordered with the competition engine version, with a matched set of triple downdraft Solex 40PAI carburetors, a higher-compression cylinder head, an oil cooler, and two fuel fillers in the trunk.\nThe engine and 4-speed competition gearbox are positioned low in the chassis, thus contributing to the benefits of a better-balanced vehicle.\nIn the front, you'll find an independent suspension using transverse leaf springs as the lower control arm (see accompanying photos). Powerful brakes and 17\" Rudge-Whitworth chromed wire wheels with 5,60 x 6,00 Michelin tires were fitted. The wheelbase is 116 inches, front track is 54 7/8 inches, and rear track is 58 3/4 inches.\nOther special competition components include:\nWhen Joseph Figoni took delivery of Wolf's rolling chassis from the Delahaye factory, he set out to make the most streamlined body possible. He wanted the convertible top to be lowered within the body. Today, we take this complex process for granted. But back then, Figoni, a streamlining pioneer, had to invent a very effective disappearing top for this car. The folding mechanism is described in French Patent 795.769, \u00abPerfectionnements aux v\u00e9hicules d\u00e9capotables\u00bb, applied for October 1, 1935 and issued January 13, 1936, just preceding the construction of this car.\nThe Type 135 Competition would be successful on nearly every venue in which it competed. It earned victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Monte-Carlo Rallye, the Paris-Saint-Raphael race, several Grand Prix races, and many other events both before and after WWII. In 1937, a year after this long-wheelbase 135 Competition was delivered to Monsieur Wolf, similar Type 135 Competitions won the Monte Carlo Rallye, and placed first and second at Le Mans. And our car, so beautiful at Concours showings, is an integral part of that championship heritage, itself placing 6th in the 1949 Monte Carlo Rallye out of a field of 230 cars, in an extremely difficult and dangerous race on the rutted muddy wreck-strewn roads of post-war Europe.\nThis flowing teardrop is Figoni one of one piece unique, combining the Delahaye identity in the grille and hood with generous teardrop fenders flanking Marchal headlights tucked tightly to the grille and a pair of separately controlled Marchal fog lights fitted low below them. The fender shape is echoed at the rear with skirts enclosing the rear tires. Chrome accents highlight the fender trailing edges matching the chrome accent sweeping back from the peak of the grille, down across the doors then filling the rear fender joint and small chrome spline down the rear deck. The lines are beyond stunning.\nMonsieur Wolf granted the privilege of showing his car to his close friend Figoni, for tours and other showings of the new streamlined coachwork. Figoni himself drove this car, as Wolf\u2019s eyesight was poor enough to limit his driving. Later, Wolf hired the famous French racing team of Guy Mairesse and Paul Vall\u00e9e to campaign the car in various racing events. We have a photo of the team piloting the car in the Rallye de Monte Carlo in 1949, kindly supplied by Claude Figoni, Joseph\u2019s son.\nYou'll appreciate the gorgeous interior's sparkling jewel-like engine-turned dashboard, soft and supple light gray (gris) quill ostrich leather seats and door panels, piped in dark blue leather. The light-colored upholstery is a perfect complement for the stunning Bleu Fonc\u00e9 exterior and works perfectly with the turned pattern dash and beautiful wood accents. Carpets are dark blue as is the soft top and trunk lining. There are so many small touches that make this car unique -- like the upswept curve at the center base of the folding windshield, a theme picked up on the polished wood door panels, and on the upholstery. And, the car also has a set of matching fitted luggage as per the original build sheet. The luggage is finished in reverse colors of dark blue (bleu fonc\u00e9) quill ostrich with gray (gris) edging and handles. The entire ensemble of internationally competitive streamlined teardrop wind-cheating luxury coachwork is simply breathtaking.\nIn excellent 100-point condition, she's ready for the next owner to take to the finest concours or rally events and compete for Best Of Show with every prospect of success. She? Mais oui... ceci est une belle voiture fran\u00e7aise, apr\u00e8s tout!\nRefined meticulously detailed elegance and streamlined design combine masterfully with competition engine and chassis in this piece unique objet d\u2019art, consistently judged to be one of Joseph Figoni\u2019s finest creations. Show, tour or simply stare at her; a visual feast; to be savored and enjoyed as both movable art and a solid investment.\n",

Power is supplied by a 390cid V8 and backed by an automatic transmission.\nThe attached picture is a screenshot referenced from the \"Vintage Thunderbird Club International, Original Factory Specifications, Volume 4, November 2002\" magazine. As indicated, there were only 17 \"M\" code Hardtop models produced in 1962, \"seventeen\". That alone makes this car very rare. This car is a survivor and to my knowledge, all equipment on this car is original except items that would have been replaced due to normal wear. If the person that purchases the car desires, I still have all the parts I have had replaced. Features include a Swing-Away steering wheel; power windows, door locks, and driver\u2019s seat; factory air conditioning; and 48-spoke Kelsey-Hayes chrome wire wheels. Many new parts have been installed including the tires, brakes, fuel pump, fuel lines, brake booster, spark plugs, and wires. This Rangoon Red Thunderbird with a reported 58,874 original miles and a white leather interior comes with receipts, parts records, and a clear title.\nMy restoration efforts have all been focused on getting the car back in road worthy condition, which it is. I have not had any interior or exterior cosmetic processes performed on this car. This will allow the new owner to put their stamp on the car by performing only the work they want.\nThis Rangoon Red Thunderbird hardtop reportedly still wears its factory chrome and stainless trim, emblems, and handles. The original headlights, grille, and bumper can be seen at the front. The factory bumper with integrated taillights and fuel door is mounted at the rear. The seller states a cosmetic piece at the bottom of the antenna is missing and there are spots of rust at the back wheel well. There is no rust on the underside of the car.\nA set of 14-inch chrome 48-spoke Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels with tri-bar center caps are wrapped in 215/75/14 whitewall tires.\nThe interior is furnished with original white leather front bucket seats with factory seat belts and a matching rear seat. This Thunderbird features the Swing-Away steering wheel. With the transmission in park, the steering wheel and column slide 18 inches to the right, allowing the driver to exit the cabin easily. The steering column is topped with a three-spoke white steering wheel with a chrome horn ring.\nThe padded dashboard is white on the bottom and contrasting gold on the top, split by ribbed trim that flows down into the center console, which houses a 120-mph speedometer, a clock, and a fuel/temperature gauge. The odometer shows 58,874, which the seller states is accurate.\nThe engine is an M-code version of the 390cid V8. The M-code option featured three two-barrel Holley carburetors and produced 340 horsepower. Factory chrome valve covers, a finned open-element air cleaner, and new spark plugs and wires complete the engine. Factory power brakes, air conditioning, power steering, and a mechanical radiator fan can be found under the hood.\nAccording to the seller, it was originally purchased by the late Aurelbelle Shaffer, who was the wife of the late Raymond Shaffer, the former president of Greyhound. Aurelbelle drove this Thunderbird as her second car and always kept it parked under a carport in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 1992, the car was placed in a storage facility in Arizona and kept there until it was moved to Georgia in 2010. The car remains in a building and has only been driven very sparingly since 1973. Receipts for parts and service work will be included in the sale.\n",

        "description": "American automotive design from the 50s was one to behold, and what it lacked in performance, it made for in class and luxury. For instance, the design behind this 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air Coupe, dressed in a two-tone red and white exterior, screams old-school luxury and style and belongs on the sets of Hollywood. What makes this car stand out is its factory styling done to perfection; all its exterior trim is present and in excellent condition, with the current owner reporting new chrome trim. For that added factory appeal, this 50s beauty sits on its factory hubcaps that are wrapped with whitewall tires, with the driver having the option to fine-tune the ride height through an adjustable airbag suspension system. Matching the two-tone red and white exterior is a matching interior. Like the exterior, the interior is factory spec and made to stand out and stay true to character. Step in, and you will find the car's interior components present and in great shape; you get A/C to weather those hot summer cruises and power windows and steering in place to make every drive effortless.\nEngine\nConsidering the condition of this 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air Coupe exterior and interior, it's unsurprising that this American legend's engine bay is in mint condition. Open the hood, and you are treated to the sight of a 283ci straight six powertrain neatly nestled in and providing decent performance. The highlighting factor, however, is not the performance but how clean the engine bay is. Components like the carburetor and other mechanical components stand out, shine out, and are ready to be featured in any automotive magazine. Power is sent to the car's rear wheels in true old-school fashion through a 3-on-the-tree manual transmission.\n",

        "description": "The car you are viewing is a 2004 Infiniti M45. I purchased this car in 2005 and have garaged it ever since; only driving for pleasure and a few trips. The car has never been used for daily transportation and has never seen snow or salt. The car had 6000 miles on it when I bought it and currently has 78000 on it. The car is regularly driven but only to keep it in good running condition. I have every service record on the car back to January 2005.\nThe car drives as new with no rattles, etc. Everything on the car is original except for the front brakes, tail pipe assembly and tires. The original front brakes were replaced at about 76000. The tail pipe assembly from the cat converter back was replaced about 10 years ago. Apparently, a weld cracked. The dealer attributed the failure to fatigue in a weld\u2014as it is a complete assembly part. There was not a mark on it\u2014it simply just failed. The tires were also replaced at about 40000 miles. They were replaced with the Michelin high speed tire which was original equipment. Only one part is worn out on the car and needs to be replaced; the gas tubes on the trunk have dried out\u2014they need to be replaced. They are hard to find.\nThe car has never been driven hard and has no paint fade. The trunk is clean and without stains. The spare is original to the car I assume. I have never looked at the spare tire.\u00a0The car has had minor paint work over the years. And the pictures show the car was repaired excellently, but it has had minor paint work.\nThese are very rare and most of them wound up on low end used car lots because they were a cheap classy ride. In fact, the Infiniti dealer told me that my car is the last one they see at all. I have not seen one on the road for several years.\nMy asking price is $12,500\n",

The first-generation six-cylinder Mustang may not be the muscular powerhouse that pony cars evolved into, but it captures precisely what Ford intended the Mustang to be: a fun-to-drive sports car that wouldn't break the bank. These days, however, the straight-six pony car is fast becoming a unicorn amid the popularity of both factory-original and V-8-swapped Mustangs. The Ford Mustang is one of the longest surviving breeds of a classic pony car, and the generation that started the line has aged well. The blue vinyl interior sitting inside the doors is in decent condition. The dash does have two large cracks. There's no letup to quality as you focus your attention towards the awesome 60's Mustang steering wheel; the expanse of blue that is contrasted with the chrome. The instrument panel whose assortment of stock gauges are in decent condition, however, the gas gauge does not read. Just below, you'll notice the factory installed under dash air conditioning system which needs repair. We all love the originality of these vehicles. The standard interior features of the 1965 Mustang included adjustable driver and passenger bucket seats, an aftermarket MUSTANG labeled AM/FM radio, and a floor-mounted shifter. Chrome bumpers and molding are in good condition. A newer Ford Motor is installed giving more horsepower. This buy also comes with the stock engine which is a Thriftpower I6 200ci 3.3L. The 200 cubic inch six cylinder was standard equipment and produced 120 horsepower. This Mustang is equipped with a three-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission. The Mustang will be sold on a clean Arizona title. Don't miss out on this awesome Mustang who needs a new home and the proper touch to make this ride fantastic through & through. Call us today at 520-631-6605.\n",

        "year": "1965",
        "description": "To fans of the Corvette, the exciting refinements of the mid-year design for 1965 offered real attraction back in the day, and modern collectors still find the third-year Sting Ray package very appealing. Four-wheel disc brakes were standard, and the heat-exhaust venting worked into the front fenders was now functional. Smoother lines on the hood and grille made the car more stylish. Cosmetically restored in 2017, the example being offered here is a beautiful vehicle equipped with an A.O. Smith body. With a detailed engine bay and underside, this convertible is being sold with its auxiliary hardtop included. The car showcases itself almost delicately in its correct eye-catching Goldwood Yellow exterior, augmented by a black soft-top and matched interior. However, any ideas of being domesticated disappear as the 327/365 HP V-8 engine comes to life. This is the solid-lifter version of Zora Arkus-Duntov\u2019s legendary small-block, which features among its attributes the GM block casting number (3782870), head casting number (3782461), intake casting number (3844461) and even the No. 2818A carburetor under the chrome air cleaner. A fresh water pump and battery are among its more recent refinements. The high-winding engine is backed by a close-ratio Muncie 4-speed transmission and a 4.11:1 Positraction rear end. Other unique points of interest are the knock-off wheels with white-stripe tires, side-mounted exhaust pipes, Teakwood steering wheel and optional AM/FM radio with power antenna. The interior also features the redesigned cues for \u201965, such as wide-padded bucket seats and molded door paneling with arm rests. Coupled with the first big-block models arriving at mid-year, many consider 1965 to be a pivotal season for America\u2019s Sports Car. In terms of color, only Tuxedo Black came on fewer editions in 1965 than Goldwood Yellow, and the driveline options on this example make it a standout in terms of true street performance.\n-Cosmetically restored 2017\n-Detailed engine bay and underside\n-Correct Goldwood Yellow exterior\n-Auxiliary hardtop -Black soft top\n-327/365 HP V-8 engine\n-Close ratio 4-speed transmission\n-4.11 Positraction rear end\n-Teakwood steering wheel\n-Knock-off wheels\n-AM/FM radio with power antenna\n-A.O.

The interior and exterior are both in most excellent condition, and\u00a0the car is garage kept and never driven on a rainy day. The body has ZERO rust, as this is an Arizona car. The top is, as new, and the rear glass is truly glass. The power top works just as it should, as do the power windows. There is a parade boot for the car, though admittedly I've never used it. The Impala includes a state of the art sound system, and is set up for Sirius XM. The sound system is installed such that the radio appears as original. Underneath the car is also as new, with all parts replaced less than 5,000 miles ago. It\u00a0offers aluminum wheels and wide tires for good traction. The engine is a 454, badged as a 396 to match the Impala's factory badges. The engine has headers. The Impala comes with an automatic transmission, with torque convertor for improved gas mileage. The car also has factory air conditioning that has been updated and uses current coolant. The radiators have been updated with new aluminum units and electric fans for cooling. The car drives straight and true, and quickly and easily does the 75 or 80\u00a0 miles per hour today's vehicles often run on the interstate. The rear end has new gears within the last 2000 miles that leave it with plenty of get up and go, but that provide a good highway ride and serve to improve the gas mileage. If you want to smoke the tires, she still does that easily. The car is upgraded with 4 wheel\u00a0disc brakes and has electronic fuel injection. If the car is to continue to be licensed in South Carolina, it has a mint condition 69 license plate that is already registered to the car. If you are looking for a daily driver, a show car, or a cross country cruiser, this one car fits all those bills quite nicely, plus it has all the room that cars of this vintage offer. Serious offers considered, but no trades and no dealer calls please. The investment in this vehicle exceeds the asking price, but it was a true labor of love to make it this nice!\u00a0\u00a0\n",

        "description": "\u00a0\nThe introduction of the Chevrolet Advance Design commercial trucks in 1947 set in motion a postwar shift which saw the 1/2-ton pickup truck start to evolve from a work and utility vehicle to a popular choice for everyday motoring. The year 1950 brought wider bench seating with deeper cushioning, a fused circuit-breaker electrical system and an improved version of the Chevrolet Thriftmaster inline 6-cylinder engine with larger exhaust valves and Rochester Power-Jet carburetor. This restored and rebuilt Chevrolet 3100 series 5 window is an outstanding example of the half-ton light-duty commercial pickup that helped reshape the way America drove trucks. The faithfully restored 216 CI Thriftmaster six was rated for 92 HP at 3,400 RPM with a single 1-barrel Rochester carburetor and is backed by a 3-speed manual transmission with a steering-column-mounted shifter. The engine features the optional oil-bath air cleaner that could trap and hold up to 2 pounds of dirt. Inside the ventilated custom 5-window cab is a brown leatherette-upholstered bench seat for three-across comfort and factory-issued style. A heater helps keep the cab comfortable on chilly cruises. Telescopic shock absorbers replaced earlier lever-action units in 1950 for an improved ride. The restored cab and pickup were painted into a two-tone cream-over-green color scheme with red Chevrolet lettering and pinstriped accents. New wood for the box floor and side rails was varnished to a deep finish. The signature Advance Design 4-bar horizontal grille with integral running lights is chrome plated to shine with the front bumper and guards, fog and headlight light surrounds, outside mirrors and rear bumper. The restored icon of American history rides on body-color-painted steel wheels with new Chevrolet-logo hubcaps and trim rings equipped with new Firestone whitewall tires. A matching spare stands ready on a custom-fabricated side mount.\n-5-window cab\n-216 CI overhead valve Thrift Master engine\n-3-speed transmission\n-Straight body panels\n-Refinished in original style Light Green with Metallic Gray fenders and roof\n-Believed to be 28,000 miles\n-Varnished wood box floor and rails\n-New Firestone wide Whitewall tires\n-Hubcaps and trim rings\n-Chrome grille\n-Deluxe oil bath air cleaner\n-Heater\n-Front bumper guards\n-Fog lights\n-Outside mirrors\n-Custom side mount spare tire\n",

This gorgeous Mustang has received a top 8 nomination at the Salon de l\u2019Auto Sport Quebec 2023 and is a standout at it is built to be driven hard and enjoyed on the road as well as in car shows.\nThe history of the Ford Mustang dates to April 17, 1964, and it was named after the P51 Mustang Fighter Plane from World War II. A legendary plane built to fight for freedom and a car specially made to enjoy this freedom. The history of the iconic Ford Mustang doesn\u2019t stop there, the experts at Fougal Creations have created a new modernised version of the legendary Mach 1 Mustang.\nThis stunning Mustang Mach 1 started life as a true 1969 manual red with black hood Mach 1. The vehicle received a full restauration including a brand new dynacorn chassis reinforced and upgraded by Fougal Creations for a modern feeling of rigidity.\nOnly then the car entered in a 3500-hour restauration and modernisation project. The custom widebody was specially crafted to fit the 10-inch wider track offered by the modern suspension. Every body panels have been completely redesigned by the team at Fougal Creations. This stunning widebody was designed to enhance the exquisite original lines of the 1969 Mustang while incorporating a set of modern aerodynamics features. A custom set of lightweight 19 wheels wrapped in Michelin super sport tires improve the beautiful legendary lines of the Mach 1 which gives the car a lower stance and a very aggressive look.\nThis Mach 1 is running a fresh 5L coyote engine breathing thru a high rpm Boss 302 intake bolted to a 5 speed Tremec transmission. This 440hp Coyote engine delivers the power to a modern 8.8 limited slip rear differential. The sound design of the custom crafted 304 stainless steel side exit exhaust system has an exotic low muscle car rumble throughout its 7500rpm rev range.\nThis feeling is continued inside where a lot of time were invested into the design, material choice as well as all the small details, like the billet aluminum GT40 toggle switches in the custom center console. The details of the redesigned interior match the sharp exterior styling of this Mach 1. With modern Dakota digital gauges, to the carbon fiber door cards and X brace, to the two sport seats arrangement with a parcel shelf including storage and the space grey interior billet aluminum pieces. A cold blowing AC system and electric windows have been fitted for a more comfortable driving experience.\nThis Mach 1 is finished in the Ford GT MKIV red with black satin accents and unique Fougal Designed MACH 1 decals to match the incredible quality of the bodywork. From trim less windows and front end, to the light buckets vents, every details have a dual purpose in functionality and design.\nThis Mach 1 was created to be thrilling to drive as much as it is to be looked at. Be the first to enjoy this car has it is fresh out from the factory located in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.\n",

There is no rust in the body. There are photos included of the wheel wells showing this.\u00a0 The wood is original except for some small repairs, and is in good condition.\u00a0 The fabric top was replaced within the last 15 years, and is in good condition.\u00a0 A set of metal drip edges for the top were acquired by the previous owner after the top work was done.\u00a0 He felt that the edging was well done when the top was replaced & did not justify tearing it up to install the steel ones.\u00a0 They are included in the sale.\nMechanical:\nAt some point before the previous Owner\u2019s purchase a Ford 8BA flathead V-8 was installed.\u00a0 He installed a new radiator, shroud, & Drake high efficiency water pumps, and it runs cool even on hot Savannah days.\u00a0 He had the car rewired including a plug for the boat trailer.\u00a0 The boat trailer currently does not have lights or wiring. A vintage turn signal kit was installed when the wiring was done, & it works great.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All lights & the horn work.\u00a0 The radio & gauges were rebuilt when the wiring was done & they work fine.\u00a0 Previous owner replaced the gas tank, generator, voltage regulator, carburetor, and stock lever action shocks.\u00a0 Since purchasing the car I have installed a Pertronix ignition system w/ Pertronix plug wires and coil, new spark plugs, a new alternator charging set up, all new Bendix/Self Adjusting brakes on all 4 wheels, and a new 6 volt battery.\nInterior:\nThe wagon has all 3 seats.\u00a0 The leather seating surfaces are in excellent condition with no visible wear, rips, etc.\u00a0 I installed all new rubber floor mats from front to rear with insulation.\u00a0 I also installed new interior & exterior mirrors, sun visors, and rear window hardware.\u00a0 The previous owner installed new dash plastic, & rebuilt the gauges & radio.\u00a0\nChassis & undercarriage\nAs stated above the brake system was replaced with Bendix/Self Adjusting drum brakes.\u00a0 The mufflers were replaced with new glass pack units received when the car was purchased.\u00a0 The dual exhaust system is tight and not objectionably loud.\u00a0 There is an electric fuel pump near the tank that has been replaced under my ownership, & it works fine. Other than mild surface rust & grime the chassis is in fine condition.\u00a0 There are no noted leaks from the brake system. The tires are \u00a0relatively new Coker radials that are in good condition.\nDriveability\nI keep a 6 volt Battery Tender on the car, and it starts easily, comes to an easy idle with some use of the choke, warms quickly, and drives out with no problems.\u00a0 Let\u2019s face it \u2013 this is an 82 year old vehicle that is built more like a piece of furniture than a modern car!\u00a0 Steering does not shimmy but can be somewhat vague.\u00a0 Brakes, even w/ the Bendix units, are not 4 wheel discs.\u00a0 Leave room in traffic!\u00a0\n1953 Fleetcraft Runabout & 15hp Evinrude Outboard\nBoat: from what I can find 1953 may be the first year that Fleetcraft made a fiberglass hulled boat.\u00a0 There is no data plate or serial # on the boat.\u00a0 The previous Owner bought the boat at an auction in PA, which makes sense since Fleetcraft boats were originally made in SE PA.\u00a0 He bought it because the hull color is such a good match w/ the wagon, plus the wood deck & interior.\u00a0 The hull, wood deck, & interior are all in great shape, and do not require any current work.\u00a0\nEvinrude Fast Twin 15hp outboard can be identified as a 1953-1954 model from the Serial #15012-01914. Since I had no plans to put the boat in the water I put oil in the cylinders, pulled it through a few times, & have not attempted to start it.\u00a0 There is a 6 gallon portable fuel tank that goes with the sale.\nTrailer: I replaced the tires, tubes, and wheel bearings.\u00a0 Installed a trailer dolly to aid in storage.\u00a0\nFun Fact: The last two years, 2021 & 2022 I have been invited to bring the woody & boat to the Hilton Head Island Concours d\u2019Elegance for their 2 day \u201cOn the Water\u201d display of antique water craft.\u00a0 They got a lot of attention!\n",

        "description": "\u201957 Chevy 2dr. Belair Post, Powered by a 350 ci LS with a BBK- SSI Single Stage Induction Manifold along with a Kwik custom front runner Serpentine belt system to handle the Vintage A/C and the P/S. Included in the power train is a 4L60E\u00a0 auto trans w/overdrive, completely rebuilt with all billet and forged internals in 2019. An Aluminum radiator w/electric fan takes care of the cooling. A custom made 9\u201d Limited slip 371 geared differential w/Chevy tube ends is included. Hydro-boost\u00a04 Wheel power disc brakes installed in May 2023, 12\u201d Front and 11\u201d Rear. 20 gal. custom stainless gas tank, by Valley. Chevy front bucket seats. Chevy center console, Electric windshield wipers w/delay, Driver and Passenger power windows, Keyless vehicle entry, Pioneer stereo radio w/disc player w/remote, Classic electronic instruments, 16\u201d American Racing Wheels, Custom free hand pin stripping that includes some 24 caret gold flake.\nThe original idea for this vehicle was to do a traditional style frame off restoration. That project was under way when 911 happened, which is why it has the design that it does. This vehicle\u00a0 was build to be driven, daily if you so desire, that is what it is for, to drive, and have fun, not to just be parked and looked at. When I drive the car I always get the thumbs up sign from other drivers and pedestrians. The car is a magnet. And it's fun to show it off even though it's more fun to drive.\nThe picture section depicts the two prior stages the vehicle was in prior to its road to completion. \u00a0\nThe Sierra Gold pictures show the condition when the car was acquired and restoration started \u00a0\nThe prime photo's show in stage body work and then the finished product.\nIncluded with the car is all of the invoices of work performed and receipts of parts purchased\u00a0 that I kept while on this mission.\u00a0 I have not added up the total of all the paper work that now fills a 3\u201d binder. I also have a complete FMV appraisal done 10/2023, that will come with the car.\u00a0\n",

Silver, in color with a gray vinyl top. Miles on the odometer show less than 18,000 (could have rolled over) and is fairly believable due to its current condition.\u00a0The paint is a 6/10 with minor blemishes and spider webbing but shows extremely well. Everything is in working order with the exception of the A/C and power antenna, I still have the original AM/FM head unit that came originally installed in this Cadillac, I installed a Bluetooth, and USB capable aftermarket stereo unit.\u00a0There was\u00a0an aftermarket phone that was installed (period correct) as an option from the dealership that is available if the new owner would like to have it (receiver is still mounted in the trunk). Comes with two sets of wheels and tires, the originals and the custom cross laced wire wheels (will negotiate price if only originals). Car cover included, the Cadillac has been garage kept under the cover.\u00a0\u00a0Asking price is $16k or best offer. inquiries, please call or text 385.418.2244\u00a0\n",

Under the hood, this Defender 110 features the 2.5 liter, turbo-diesel Inline-4 200TDi engine which produces enough torque to pull stumps on your farm and enough power to cruise effortlessly on the highway- all while providing remarkable fuel economy for a vehicle of this size. The engine is run through a five-speed manual gearbox with a two-speed transfer case and locking center differential for ultimate off road control. In addition to everything that comes on a standard Defender 110, this car has been modified by UK Defender specialists Arkonik with a host of welcome upgrades.\nOne of the signature features of Arknonik are their body kit and wheel packages. On this example, a stunning set of gloss black painted fender extensions are paired with a purposeful looking front bumper mounted brush bar and black painted diamond plating on the fender tops and along the bottom of the body. Black painted side steps and a Front Runner roof rack with rear ladder add practicality to the rig and a fantastic look. The standard 16\" wheels have been swapped out for an 18\" set of Khan Design wheels painted in black and shod in knobby BFG K02 off road wheels with a matching rear mounted spare. All of the lighting has been swapped out to LEDs and auxiliary units have been added to the roof rack and brush bar. The interior has been thoroughly upgraded with high quality black and tan leather interior and the front seats are heated. A set of black all weather floor mats cover the black carpet and a large center console offers extra storage and cup holders for the front passengers. The Arkonik build on this Defender was completed in September of 2016 and shows just over 14,000 miles since the completion of the project.\nArkonik Options\n",

Now, we all know that this truck came from the factory with a mission to drink all the fossil fuel and create about 230 Horsepower. So a little more than my weed eater. Chevrolet had this engine so detuned it was not funny. Well this truck has changed all that.\nThe owner of this truck tell us it was dreamed up and assembled in California by Duane Mayer of American Hot Rods, this was Boyd Coddington's shop. The 454 now puts out 550Horsepower with the help of a lot of go fast goodies like CNC3 heads, a comp cam lifts the valves and roller rockers, Edlebrock Victor Jr. intake and Holley style ( I believe quick fuel ) Carburetor, MSD H.E.I. distributor and a set of Sanderson tri y headers. This potent power plant is backed with a 700R4 Art Carr automatic transmission and Art Morrison 4 link rear suspension system to plant the power to the road Boyd Coddington's rims, 20inch in the rear and 18 up front. this truck has it all and it looks great too, slick black paint leather interior and a stance that, well, you have seen it and it is sweeet.\u00a0\nthe list of options goes on for awhile and include A/C, power windows and locks , leather interior, AM/FM CD player, but the music coming from the exhaust is the sweet sound of Horsepower. Are you ready for this?\n",

For balance of payment, bank wire transfer (preferred), cashier's check, or cash (in-person at seller's bank) is accepted. Vehicle will not be released until funds have settled/cleared.\nINSPECTION\nIMPORTANT: If the buyer chooses to buy sight unseen the buyer accepts the vehicle as-is and understands concerns will not be addressed post sale.

Bright chrome bumpers front and back, and all the chrome trim shines like new.\nUnder the hood resides the factory original 440 CI, HP, Super Commando V-8, with 4 bbl carburetor, which is attached to a 727 automatic transmission, which delivers power to the sure grip rear end with 3:23 gears.

All guages, speedometer, black power convertible top, and the original AM radio all work as they should.\n\u00a0\nNote: As an older restoration the car is not \"perfect\" as there are a couple of paint chips/cracks on the car. This car comes with the original fender tag, build sheet, as well as documentation from Chrysler and a 48 page Wise report, confirming this cars pedigree as an original, unmolested, classic.\u00a0\n",

        "description": "This beautiful 1974 International Harvester Series 200 is a \u00be-ton 4\u00d74 pickup that was sold new by Stewart International Inc of Salina, Kansas in December 1973. The previous owner acquired the truck in 2011, and a refurbishment that was completed in 2016 which included repainting the vehicle in a baby blue paint, refreshing the blue vinyl interior, and rebuilding the 345ci V8 and the four-speed manual transmission. The truck has no signs of rust and is a very clean rig inside and out. The truck has been undercoated as well as the bed of the truck. Other features include a dual-range transfer case, a chrome front bumper and trim, side body moldings, a rear step bumper, dual exhaust outlets, a push-button radio, and a heater.\u00a0The clutch was replaced in July 2022. This International pickup rides on a 132\u2033 wheelbase and has \u201cEight 200 All Wheel Drive\u201d badging on the front fenders. White-painted 16\u2033 steel wheels wear gray International hubcaps and are mounted with Power King Extra Traction tires. The truck is equipped with manually locking front hubs, and braking is handled by front discs and rear drums. The interior was refreshed under previous ownership, and the bench seat has been reupholstered in blue vinyl. Features include a cabin heater, lap belts, a black dash-top cover, vent windows, and a push-button AM radio. A three-spoke steering wheel frames a horizontal 120-mph speedometer, an ammeter, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The truck is powered by a 345ci V8 that was rebuilt during the refurbishment and is equipped with an electric fuel pump. The truck also had a Holley Fuel Injection installed last year that makes this rig run flawlessly. Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. This is a remarkable truck that gets compliments everyone it goes and is questionably one of the nicest Series 200 truck around today.\n",

        "description": "The Collector Edition Corvette\u00a0\nThis is a 1982 Collector Edition Corvette, the last of the third-generation Corvettes.\u00a0\u00a0The Collector Edition Corvette has special Champagne paint and upholstery, special cloisonn\u00e9 crossed-flag emblems on the hood, steering wheel and rear deck, a custom exterior graphics package with shadow-style graphics on the hood and sides, varying from Champagne to dark brown, along with a special set of 15-inch turbine-vane aluminum wheels.\u00a0\u00a0These are similar to the custom wheels on the 1963 split window coupe.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe custom interior includes champagne leather seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, matching carpeted floor mats, (CC1) smoke colored T-top removable roof panels, matching carpeted luggage area with black concealment shade.\u00a0\u00a0The rear window hatch was engineered with hinged glass to open on the Collector Edition Corvette, rather than a fixed window.\u00a0\u00a0Although due to a design flaw, most hinges fail after regular use.\u00a0\u00a0\nCollector Edition Corvettes also has standard equipment that was optional on other \u201882 corvettes such as electric windows, (AG9) six-way power driver\u2019s seat, (AU3) power door locks, (K35) cruise control, automatic electric antenna, (DG7) power mirrors, (C49) rear window defogger, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe 5.7-liter, 350 cubic inch, L83 V8 uses Cross-fire fuel injection which features two cross-mounted 48mm throttle-body injection units. Each throttle-body feeds one bank of cylinders on the v8 engine. This gives it 200 horsepower at 4,200 rpm and 285 lb.-ft of torque. During full throttle a solenoid operated door in the hood opened to allow air directly into the air cleaner. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. This car can move.\n1982 corvettes came with a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and a lockup torque-converter clutch - breakthrough technology at the time.\nThe collector edition includes standard features such as power steering and brakes, a telescoping and tilting steering wheel, pop up halogen headlamps, full instrumentation such as fuel, oil pressure and temp gages, tachometer, and voltage.\u00a0\u00a0Four-wheel independent suspension.\u00a0\u00a0Limited slip 2.87 differential.\nAn authentic Collector Edition Corvette will have a \u201c0\u201d as the sixth character in its VIN as this car does.\u00a0\u00a0Production was limited to 6,759 cars.\u00a0\u00a0This makes this car a rarity.\nAbout this Collector Edition Corvette\u00a0\nI Bought this Vette here in Maryland in late 1984 from a GM mechanic who loved it but couldn\u2019t afford it.\u00a0\u00a0It had about 20,000 miles on the odometer. Today it\u2019s 61,000 miles.\nFor a few years I commuted in it, before making it my weekend ride. It\u2019s always been garaged, even at the office.\nMy employer paid for all maintenance and repairs, so nothing needed was missed.\nTo my knowledge, the car has not been in an accident and the engine is original.\nRestoration\nOver the past 12 months, I\u2019ve invested over $10,000 in restoration. All documented.\u00a0\u00a0Including:\nAdditional Features\u00a0\nAlso included is a custom cotton dust cover and a framed poster of the 1982 Collector Edition Corvette.\u00a0\u00a0The dust cover is especially helpful for protecting the car in your garage. I have the original keys, as well as several copies.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, the original T-top leather storage covers, original owners manual and the Chevrolet Corvette service manual are included.\u00a0\u00a0See photos.\nNotice the champagne leather T-top bracket bag in the back - this is for the optional: (V54) Roof Panel Carrier.\u00a0\u00a0It contains mounting brackets for the T-tops when they\u2019re off the car.\u00a0\u00a0I have included photos of the mounting frames.\u00a0\u00a0They\u2019re like new.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve never seen these offered for sale in like new condition.\nNot a Perfect Car\nThere is a scratch on the passenger door, which I\u2019ve shown in the photos.\u00a0\u00a0I had a recent quote of $350 to repaint the door.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve also highlighted a few other flaws, no matter how trivial, in the photos.\nAside from the Air Conditioning, all power features and gauges on this car work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The air conditioning compressor runs, but needs Freon.\u00a0\u00a0The rear windows on Collector Edition Corvettes nearly all have problems opening due to the design flaw in the hinges.\u00a0\u00a0The release handle on this car does not allow the rear window to open.\nWant to learn more?\nI\u2019d be glad to put a prospective buyer in touch with both the local Corvette mechanics who\u2019ve recently worked on the car.\u00a0\u00a0They\u2019re more than happy to speak with you.\u00a0\u00a0You are also welcome to hire a mechanic for an independent opinion on the car.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, I will answer any questions you might have to the best of my knowledge.\nAsking Price\u00a0\nThe asking price is not arbitrary nor based on an inflated opinion of the car\u2019s condition.\u00a0\u00a0After much study, I set the asking price based on the recent sale of a Collector Edition Corvette, in very similar condition and owner history.\u00a0\u00a0That car sold for $29,400 at auction sixteen months ago. Auctions are a strong indicator of true market value.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve observed at least eight other completed auctions of similar vehicles in that price range in the past two years.\u00a0\u00a0Allowing for the air conditioning and the scratch on the door, I\u2019ve set my price slightly lower.\u00a0\u00a0I believe it\u2019s a very fair market price for this car.\u00a0\nWhy you should seriously consider this car\nBuying this car is like stepping back in time to 1982. It\u2019s in showroom condition.\u00a0\nI love this car, but I\u2019m selling it to make room in my garage for some other projects.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed it, but now it\u2019s time to pass it on to bring joy and someone else.\u00a0\nWhen I sell a car, my name goes on the bill of sale.\u00a0\u00a0There should be no surprises for the buyer.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve made every effort to be candid about the true condition of the car.\u00a0\nEvery repair expense since I\u2019ve owned it is fully documented and indexed in a binder.\u00a0\u00a0See photos.\u00a0\u00a0These records are included with the car so you can protect your investment.\nWhen you buy a car from a dealer, you don\u2019t know the history of ownership and care.\u00a0\u00a0This dramatically increases your risk.\u00a0\u00a0With this car, you have a wealth of information available to you.\u00a0\u00a0Including a 40-year ownership history.\u00a0\u00a0Plus the recent investment of over $10,000 in restoration.\u00a0\u00a0All fully documented.\nA quality classic corvette is an investment.\u00a0\u00a0They always go up in value.\u00a0\u00a0If you compromise your standards, and buy a low priced, low quality, classic car, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure if you ever choose to sell it.\u00a0\u00a0But if you buy a high quantity specimen, like this one, and take good care of it, you\u2019ll do very well if you decide to sell it.\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s far more important than bargain hunting or haggling for a great deal.\u00a0\u00a0Think strategically about the long game for your investment.\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t let this one get away.\nSummary\nThis is a high end, recently restored collector vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0If you want a C3 Collector Edition Corvette in original condition, that you won\u2019t have to spend time and money on to drive and enjoy after you invest in it, with a known and documented history, this car won\u2019t disappoint you.\n",

Hellwig front and rear sway bars. New rear drum brakes, new font Pirate front disc front brake conversion. New 15 inch Cragar SS wheels and BF Goodrich Radial TA's with less than 500 miles on them. Car blasted and underbody all treated with rust prevention. Will need a new drivers floor section. Minor bubbles as shown in photos. Trunk also treated, it does have some spots. Has been kept garaged, by the way the car presents I would say it has been garaged most of its life. It drives really well, runs great. Get's a lot of compliments. It's not a show car by any means, it's not fast. It's very original and a nice car to cruise in. Lot of time and $$ spent on it. Can easily just drive it and enjoy it or take it further if you wanted. I really enjoy driving it when I can. I travel a lot out of the country for work and find I don't have the time to use it. Please don't waste your time or mine, if you see the car in person you will know it's a very good example. I can't answer my phone all the time so best to text and I will call you back when I can. Clean Kentucky title in hand. Thanks for looking.\u00a0\n",

        "description": "Imagine pulling up to the drive-in in what may be the only numbers matching, 1967 Purple \u201cGoat\u201d. This award winning 67 GTO Hardtop Coupe was ordered from the factory with special metallic paint \u201cPlum Mist\u201d and factory air. While this was a GM color, Pontiac stopped offering plumb mist on the GTO in 1966. Born in Pontiac, Michigan on October 31st, this special order GTO was delivered to Smith Motor Company in Laurens, South Carolina. Years later the car was found abandoned in a Texas auto body shop, when it later underwent a complete frame off (1/16) rotisserie restoration in 2016. The car has its numbers matching Pontiac 400 4bbl with 335hp, \u00a0three-speed\u00a0Turbo-Hydramatic\u00a0TH-400, which was equipped with a\u00a0Hurst Performance\u00a0dual-gate shifter, called a \"his/hers\" shifter, that permitted either automatic shifting in \"drive\" or manual selection through the gears. Everything works as it should and it is documented that the car has been driven less than 2600 miles since restoration. It has always been stored in a climate-controlled garage.\nThe car comes with restoration documentation as well as Pontiac Historical Society\u2019s documentation of the special paint code and window sticker. It received the \u201cRestored Auto\u201d award at the 2021 Good Guys car show. All sheet metal is original other than the hood which was purchased after the original was damaged by the sand blasting process. The exhaust and headers were replaced during restoration and provides a great rumble from the stock 400.\nDesigned by John DeLorean, the Pontiac GTO is considered of the most desirable cars of the muscle car era. The 1967 is often considered the most desirable, featuring sleek design updates to the hood, grill and taillights. I am sad to see my baby go, but it is time to turn over the keys and let someone else enjoy this classic icon of American car history.\n\u00a0\n",

        "description": "Attention, car aficionados and Lamborghini zealots!\n**Overview:** \u00a0\nIntroducing an exclusive masterpiece with roots from 1984, crafted by Teledyne Continental Motors. Originally conceived as a prototype for the U.S. Military, this is the *only running model* of the three ever produced. A blend of military prowess and high-end luxury, it's more than a vehicle\u2014it's an experience.\n\u00a0\n**Historical Significance: **\nTied intriguingly to the Lamborghini Cheetah design, this LFV was central to the automotive face-off of the late 1980s, involving industry giants such as Chrysler, Cadillac Gage, and AM General.\n\u00a0\n**Provenance:**\n- Formerly showcased at the Ropkey Armor Museum, Indianapolis.\n- Procured from L3 Corp's plant, once known as Teledyne Continental Motors by Ropkey Armor Museum.\n- Includes the original marketing brochure provided by former Teledyne Continental Motors executive.\n\u00a0\n**Restoration & Features:**\n- Meticulously restored by OffShore OffRoad Custom's, Nantucket.\n- Made Street-legal, complete with Massachusetts Vehicle Identification Number.\n- Original BMW 2.4L 6 Cylinder Turbo Diesel Engine (fully rebuilt).\n- AWD automatic transmission.\n- Note: Gearing modification in transmission\u00a0is required for optimal driving. Currently, the RPM's are running too high for highway driving. A skilled transmission shop can assist with this modification.\n\u00a0\n**Asking:**\nPriced at $250,000 US dollars (OBO). \u00a0Open to trade(s), especially those of equal allure, which is actually preferred.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n**Current Location:**\nResiding in Palm Beach Gardens, FL.\n\u00a0\n**Extras:**\n- Pictures may not do justice, but one gaze in person and you'll be captivated and see how truly awesome this vehicle is.\n- Features original gun turret (for bragging rights, of course), not that you will ever need it.\n- Original parts and two extra fenders included in the sale.\n\u00a0\nVISIT www.1984TCM.com for more pictures, videos & information.\n\u00a0\nSeize this opportunity to be the talk of the town.

        "description": "1977 CORVETTE L-82\u00a0\u00a0 LISTING ID \u00a0\u00a0CC-1744856\nORIGINAL OWNER\nThe auto for sale is a (Matching Numbers) late production (# 43,450 of 49,213) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0L-82 Corvette delivered to a GM dealer in Detroit who immediately assigned it to the body shop where the entire car was\u00a0blocked, sanded, and covered with 6 coats of black lacquer paint. When finished, it was gifted to his nephew, a newly minted Medical Doctor. In the interim the Doctor had accepted a position in France, so he took possession, drove to Minneapolis then sold it to me in early November 1977. Since then it has been meticulously maintained for a very demanding Mechanical Engineer. Effectively I am the original owner although technically the car has been mine for 46 years less the few weeks it was in transit.\nIn Minneapolis the car was stored in a heated garage from October to May every year until 1986 when it was relocated\u00a0 to California and then to Arizona, where it has been garaged ever since. \nThe 1977 Corvette is a beautiful automobile, but this model year also had some significant disappointments. The 1977 Corvette is a 3500-pound sport car designed to operate with 350+ horsepower. By 1977 the L-82 engine output had been reduced by almost 150 HP due to \u201cemission controls\u201d. in my opinion, this model with 210 HP is underpowered and, even with the California Emission Certification option installed, it still failed to meet California or Canadian emission standards. \nThe shortcoming was addressed by Twin City Racing in Minneapolis who Installed an Edelbrok performance intake manifold and in 1984 after a 2-year year search installed a factory set of 2.17 Chevy heads. Estimated improvement 100-115 HP, several years later a custom exhaust system was fabricated and installed. The factory\u00a0 double \u201cy\u201d\u2013 single cat converter system was replaced with larger diameter straight pipes utilizing exhaust routing layouts designed into the Corvette frame. Another catalytic converter and twin high bypass mufflers completed the design. The results were amazing! Emissions for hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, idle and loaded, were roughly 90% lower than Arizona mandates. \u00a0A copy of the last emission test is attached.\n\u00a0\nAs this Corvette sits today, it has roughly 350 horsepower, was licensed in California for 14 years and had no\u00a0problem\u00a0passing California emission protocols. If the buyer prefers a \u201cSurvivor\u201d car most original factory parts are like new, including AM/FM stereo radio, clock, radiator tanks, set of 2.02 heads, intake manifold and other spare parts. It was last repainted in 1997.\nIn 2004 Mike Scott, a Corvette judge and owner of Corvette Corrections in Anaheim California appraised the car for \u201cnot less than $20,000\u201d ($32,200) in 2023 dollars. In the appraisal he also said \u201cthis is one of the nicest 1977 Corvettes I have inspected. It is also one of the rarest by color combination. Black exterior and smoke gray leather interior. This car has been kept in very good condition inside and out. This vehicle is also highly optioned.\u201d \nA copy of the appraisal is attached. Maintenance log is available.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

It is complete with the 409 engine, 4-speed transmission, and the Super Sport package. This survivor is one of 142 ever built. This car comes with both the Muncie and Borg and Warner 4 Speed transmission.\u00a0\nThis car in magazines:\nMore pictures: http://www.mjpropix.com/Cars/Impala-Super-Sport/\u00a0\nChevrolet brought real power to the people during 1961, and did so with style. The midyear introduction of the Super Sport option package showcased another new arrival, the 409-CUIN V8.\nThe SS kit was offered on any Impala. It included Super Sport trim inside and out, chassis reinforcements, stronger springs and shocks, power brakes with sintered metallic linings, spinner type wheel covers, and of Chevy\u2019s earliest uses of narrow band whitewall tires. The dashboard gained a Corvette type grab bar, and the steering column got a 7000 RPM Tachometer.\nOnly Chevy\u2019s toughest V8\u2019s were offered with the SS package. It was available with 348-CUIN with four-barrel or tri power. The other choice was the 409. Essentially a larger displacement 348, its upgrades include forged aluminum pistons, a wilder camshaft and 11.25:1 compression. A single four-barrel mated to the aluminum manifold. It made 360 bhp. It also made history.\nChevy built 491,000 Impala for \u201961. Only 453 had the SS package and of those, just 142 got the 409. But word spread quickly. Here was a mainstream Chevy V8 with 409 lb-ft of torque and the ability to turn mid 15 second quarter-miles with the standard 3.36:1 rear axle and mandatory four-speed manual transmission.\nSpecifications\nWheelbase, inches: 119.0\nWeight, lbs.: 3,700\nNumber built: 142\nBase price (1961): $2,900\nStandard Engine\nType: ohv V-8\nDisplacement, cid: 409\nFuel system: 1 x 4bbl.\nCompression ratio: 11.25:1\nHorsepower @ rpm: 360 @ 5800\nTorque @ rpm: 409 @ 3600\nRepresentative Performance\n0-60 mph, sec: 7.8\n1/4 mile, sec. @ mph: 15.8 @ 94.1\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\u00a0\n",

Four models were available for 1961-63, including the Hardtop, formal Landau Hardtop, Convertible, and from 1962, the Sports Roadster. Along with exterior updates, including a new vertical-bar grille and revisions to the body sides and taillights, the 1963 Thunderbird included additional sound-deadening material and a quieter, longer-life exhaust system, plus upgrades to the electrical system and accessories for improved reliability, including a remote operated convertible top! Accordingly, today's classic Thunderbird collectors particularly sought the final-year Bullet Thunderbirds for 1963. Powered by a Z-code 390 CI V-8 engine with a 4-barrel carburetor delivering 300 factory-rated horsepower, this 1963 Ford Thunderbird Convertible benefits handsomely from a nearly complete restoration, with only a few items left to make this 100% restored, invested $46,367 to date.\u00a0 Make a reasonable offer!\n",

Did it work? As an engineering triumph, you bet. Though Hemi-headed engines had been used by racing and high-end brands in the pre-war era, it took Chrysler to bring them to mainstream America in the post-war era. Among other advantages: The shape of the combustion chamber allowed a central spark plug location for more efficient fuel ignition, and valve sizes grew because they didn't rub shoulders with one another, as they did in conventional engines. A better burn and bigger valves meant more power. Chrysler's Hemi weighed in at the same 331-cu in displacement as the mighty Cadillac V-8, and the Mopar put out 20 more horsepower. And Dodge dropped theirs into every body style it offered: coupe, sedan, wagon, convertible, whatever.\nDisplacement grew rapidly, as did Dodge's cars, through the 1950s: an overbore in 1955 brought displacement to 270 cubes and 150 hp.\u00a0 The Century's hemispherical V-8 lasted into the mid-1980s. Since that time, the term Mopar has basically become synonymous in automotive circles with any Chrysler-built vehicle, which would include Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, Plymouth, Imperial and DeSoto.\nCarburetor:\nTransmission:\nShifter:\u00a0\nFront Suspension:\nFour Wheel Disc Brakes\nShocks:\nWheels & Tires: \n\u00a0\n",

The condition of the body reflects the mileage and doesn't show any sign of wear. There is not a stonechip in the paint, not even in the wheel wells. The\u00a0''Springtime Yellow''\u00a0paint which is the original color, is immaculate. Nice finish, no scratches or stonechips, and definitely no rust. Gaps between the panels are perfect\u00a0The undercariage is also perfect, it was completely sandblasted before being repainted in the original ''Red Oxyde'' primer, and oversprayed with the exterior color, exactly how it would have been from factory. It originaly came with the ''Lower Back Panel Grille'' Exterior Decor Group, which includes the following: Pop-open Gas Cap, Chrome Wheel Wells modlings, Fog Lights, Louvered Hood with Turn Signals.\n\u00a0\nThis one is a ''C-Code'' and was equipped with a 289ci with the a\u00a02bbl Autolite 2100 300CFM carburator. The original engine is still in the car, was rebuilt during the restoration. It has about 91 miles since rebuild. We just did a complete tune-up and drove the car to make sure everything was functionning properly due to being stored for a long period of time. The original C4 Transmission was replaced for a rebuilt 4-Speed Toploader. Rear end is still the original 8'' with 2:79 gears.\n\u00a0\nIt also came with the optional Power Steering, front Power Disc Brakes, Tinted Glass, A/C and AM Radio. All of these are still on the car except for the original A/C System.\n\u00a0\nIt never ran on rainy days.\u00a0 This car has all original metal body panels from what we observed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe interior was restored.

It\u00a0has won countless first-place trophies from Best of Show, Best Engine, Peoples Choice, and has been featured\u00a0in Street Roder,\u00a0Hot Rod, and JEGS\u00a0magazines. The engine is\u00a0a well thought-out 350 Small Block\u00a0Chevy 4-Bolt Main\u00a0with consultation\u00a0from B&M and multiple\u00a0mechanics. The motor was built from the ground-up designed for\u00a0this specific blower configuration--it was not a retro-fit. Because of this, this motor is trouble-free and runs like new. Similar builds face overheating and calibration troubles. This motor stays at or below 180 degrees idling on the\u00a0hottest asphalt, driving in parades, or cruising on the interstate. The whiskey keg\u00a0trailer is custom-built to be towed as a luggage carrier and\u00a0meets the pivot-clearance of the wheelie-bars.

Dual-action\u00a0B&M StarShifter, powder-coated frame to protect from road rash, chrome-mirrored fire wall, radio with speakers, turn/brake signals, ahoooga horn, classic Ford instrument package (water temp, oil pressure, MPH, fuel, battery voltage), battery kill-switch. Recent maintenance: carburetors have been recently cleaned,\u00a0new battery, oil change, new fluids, new plugs, overall inspection from top-down.\u00a0\nTrailer\u00a0Highlights:\nThe authentic wooden whiskey keg trailer is a huge bonus that in and of itself is of value. Every time you open the trailer, the smell of whiskey hits your nose.\u00a0The \"PLATTE VALLEY BOURBON\" lettering was carefully crafted using\u00a0real gold flake and chrome lantern signal/brake\u00a0lights.\u00a0\nAdditional\u00a0Details:\u00a0\nThis one-of-a-kind\u00a0T-bucket\u00a0is highway worthy and show ready. The motor is nicely broken-in and has the classic racing CAM whine\u00a0that everyone loves to hear.\u00a0This\u00a0T-buckethas been in weddings, parades, commercials, and magazines.

        "description": "No other like this one in the World. This head turner is not only a collector but will make other riders jaws drop in envy!! NO JOKE. Everyone loves this bike when they see it. If I didn't have a wedding to pay for I'd keep it forever.\u00a0\nIn response to the sales success of smaller Japanese bikes in the 1960\u2019s, Harley-Davidson formed a plan to offer a new small-displacement machine to compete as its own small-engined Hummer model left a lot to be desired. Around this same time Aermacchi was interested in focusing more resources on its aeronautical division and allowed Harley to grab a 50 percent stake in Aermacchi\u2019s moto-division for just $250K. Aermacchi fit the bill to a T as far as what H-D had in mind as the Italian marque produced a solid little 250 that possessed a lot of potential for further development.\nThe 250\u2019s that were born out of this arrangement quickly proved themselves in competition, taking various podium spots in high-profile and prestigious events like the lightweight class of late 60\u2019s and early 70\u2019s TT\u2019s. Around this same time, the quarter-liter Italimerican racer was taken and bored out an extra 100 cc\u2019s, resulting in the 350 which was produced from \u201969-\u201974. Unfortunately, the more impressive characteristics of the race-bred 350\u2019s \u2013 such as its short-stroke cylinder dimensions and five-speed transmission \u2013 failed to trickle down to the production model racers, leaving the 250\u2019s and 350\u2019s to finish at the bottom of the pack in magazine class shootouts of the era. As a consolation prize, the Harlimacchi did get the best gas mileage of all the machines in its class at 47-58mpg.\nAt the heart of the Sprint 350 was an air-cooled 344cc OHV single that produced a claimed 25 hp at 7,000 rpm and had a reported top speed of 92.49 mph (presumably with a jockey-sized pilot and a solid tailwind). The bike had a \u201chalf-wet\u201d (half full fuel tank) weight of 323 lbs, and sold new in 1969 for $795, an amount that translates to a little under $5.5K in today\u2019s money. The Sprint wasn\u2019t a particularly hot seller in the States, though it did do better after being given a new name. When it first arrived on American shores the Sprint was initially dubbed \u201cThe Wisconsin\u201d. And while sales might have been satisfactory at dealerships in the Green Bay area, it didn\u2019t attract many buyers from outside the bike\u2019s namesake state, and thus the moniker was changed to the Sprint which could be appreciated on a more universal level.\nDespite them both being production models, far fewer 350\u2019s were produced than 250\u2019s, making examples noticeably more rare and therefore valuable. I won\u2019t get into the debate on whether or not people should be resto-modding rare classics (especially when there\u2019s a lot more mod than resto), but I will say this 350 has been thoughtfully \u2013 and tastefully in my opinion \u2013 upgraded. While its appearance is subjective, it\u2019s almost impossible to argue with the mechanical and performance-related upgrades that have gone onto this 1970 350.\nStarting with the engine, this SS350 was given a new Wiseco race piston, new carb and K&N air-filter, new valves and guides, new gaskets and seals, and new clutch disks. The ignition and electrical systems have been refreshed via a new Power Dynamo 12-Volt generator and voltage regulator, new 12 volt ignition coil, points, condenser, and spark plug all made by Pertronix. According to the ad, there are also a handful of unmentioned upgrades and parts.\nOther non-mechanical upgrades include new cables throughout, new chain, new fork seals and O-rings, a NOS \u201cH\u201d model fuel tank, new Pingel fuel shutoff-valve, new gas-cap, new rear-suspension, new cafe-style seat unit and saddle, new hardware and fasteners throughout, and a new 12-volt headlight and taillight. This little orange runner is also sitting on new Akront/Italian-style flanged alloy rims wrapped in new vintage Firestone Deluxe Champion rubber.\nEvery surface on this 350 is pretty immaculate with pristine paint and all metal surfaces having been adequately polished. The orange and black paint digs are unmistakably Harley-Davidson racing, and there appear to be a lot of individual NOS parts such as the chrome pipes and even the vintage H-D footpegs look brand spankin\u2019 new. Because only 25 miles have been put on this machine since its resto-mod job, as it currently stands it\u2019s more or less a museum-quality example. I personally like it, but was this a job well done? Or is this just sacrilegious to do to a seldom-seen classic?\n",

        "description": "\nThis 1996 Jaguar XJS 2+2 convertible has been driven 50K miles since new and draws power from a 4.0-liter inline-six paired with a ZF four-speed automatic transmission. Its cabin offers automatic climate control, woodgrain trim, and power-adjustable bucket seating. Finished in Carnival Red with a tan power-retractable top over a tan leather interior, this XJS is now offered with a convertible boot, a CARFAX report, and a California title in the seller's name.\u00a0\nThis grand-touring convertible is coated in Carnival Red and accented by a tan power-retractable top with a glass rear window. Exterior features include a chin spoiler, chrome trim and mirror caps, a trunk-mounted third brake lamp, and polished dual exhaust outlets.\nChrome 16-inch five-spoke wheels are wrapped in Remington Emerald LX tires.\nThe 2+2 tan leather interior is fitted with power-adjustable leather bucket seats up front and a two-seat bench in the rear, matched to the door panels, dash, console, carpeting, and floor mats. Amenities include woodgrain trim, power windows, air conditioning, an analog clock, cruise control, an AM/FM/cassette audio system, and a carpeted trunk with a spare tire.\nInstrumentation consists of a 160-mph speedometer, a 7K-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for the voltage, fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The six-digit mechanical odometer reads 50K miles, which is in line with the mileage shown on the CARFAX report.\nThe fuel-injected 4.0-liter inline-six was rated at 245 horsepower and 289 lb-ft of torque when new. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a console-shifted ZF four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential.\nThe CARFAX report shows that a Junk title was issued in the state of Indiana in\u00a0June 2021. The vehicle passed a California emissions inspection in 2021 and comes with\u00a0an unbranded California title. The sale includes a convertible boot.\n\u00a0\n",

        "year": "1971",
        "description": "Each Generation of Ford Thunderbirds from 1955 through 2005 must have a nickname, it seems. For the Fifth Production Cycle offered between 1967 and 1971, T-bird enthusiasts have assigned the name Glamor Bird. The label is certainly appropriate, as this was the largest and most luxurious Thunderbird offered to date. In a further departure from the traditional Thunderbird image as a Personal Sport-Luxury Automobile, the Convertible body style was discontinued. In its place, a four-door model was added to the lineup, officially known as the Landau with a wheelbase of 117.2 inches. This longer T-bird sedan chassis was shared with the Lincoln Continental Mark III. Since they were both born in the same factory in Wixom-Michigan.\nTo add some more distinctive features, the rear doors were hinged at the rear and opened from the front, the arrangement famously known in the years past as \"Suicide Doors\". In most other aspects the four door T-bird was virtually identical to its Coupe sibling, with a luxury cabin and every available convenience gadget of the era. Priced in the $4800.- to $5500.- range, the Glamor Birds were far and away the most expensive cars in the Ford lineup, priced at a few thousand more than a comparable Galaxie or LTD.\u00a0\nFor the 1970-1971 model years, all the Glamor Birds including the Landau Sedan received new front-end styling and tail light section as well. The prominent protruding nose a.k.a. \"Bunkie Beak\" and tail light lenses - resembling spread wings - was a favorite of then Ford President Semon E. \"Bunkie\" Knudsen. The '70-'71 model years were the best built Thunderbirds to date. Printed circuitry, introduced in 1968, continued to make the instruments reliable and accurate. Thunderbird's dignified ride was designed by computer. Their interiors were pressure tested at the Factory to check for air leaks. Since this body style had been around for four years, they left the Assembly Plant pretty much perfect. The Thunderbirds for 1970-'71 were the most elegant looking and very dependable due to a strong and smooth running 429 Thunderjet Engine with four-barrel Carb. paired to a C-6 Automatic Transmission, complete with a Dual Exhaust.\u00a0\nPerhaps at some point in the future, the question posed will be, \"Whatever happened to four door Thunderbirds?\" Already rare to begin with, when these cars are finally given the recognition they deserve, prices will go through the roof. For four-door T-bird Collectors today, their wisdom and insight will no doubt prove to be a prudent investment for them!\nThe beautiful four-door Landau made its final appearance for 1971, with a production number of 36000 total Thunderbirds produced. Of those, only 6500 were made as four-door sedans. This particular example has the bench seat, where only 2300 were created!\u00a0\nThis desirable piece of Automotive Design and History is highly coveted and sought after by experienced Collectors and Investors alike as a Legacy to the Car Designers of the past! It is the rarest of all T-bird model years. This stunning specimen in particular, wears an exterior that is presented in a striking Burgundy Fire Poly with color matching disc hubcaps and captivating Onyx Black Metallic Roof, that accents the contrasting Landau Bars very well and spells Pure Class! This color scheme is paired to an inviting Cream Interior with plush Red Carpeting.\n\u00a0The car, though mostly original, has only been mildly restored to keep its authenticity. The undercarriage still has lots of \"Ziebart\" Rust Protection\u00a0left. It comes with a new starter, brake booster, new battery, power window motors, new tires, complete new exhaust system (front to back) and all fluids changed and is ready to be enjoyed! Also included are two spare sets of hubcaps (dog dish and turbine style), rear window, windshield, grill, headlight bezels, cornering lights, chrome oil pan and a front bumper guard which was a rare option! Delivery in an enclosed Transporter, within B.C. and Alberta included in price! Loosing storage space for the upcoming Winter Season, therefore open to reasonable offers!\n",

This Z-28\u00a0was fully restored around 10 years ago. It was put in a collection of over 50 Camaro and never driven, until we purchased it.\u00a0 This vehicule is Matching Numbers all around & matching options. We have decoded all the mechanical parts on the vehicle.\nOriginal options:\n\u00a0\nIt came factory in its actual ''Garnet Red''\u00a0dress\u00a0with\u00a0black stripes. The body & paint are\u00a0in immaculate condition. The paint has a mirror like finish, fit of the panels are all very nice. All the original Z28 and Rally Sport badges were reinstalled\u00a0after the full repaint.\u00a0The undercarriage is in absolutely spotless. All the glass is original and in good condition. The aluminum trims are original/restored, in very good condition without dents. The chrome bumpers are original rechromed. The only sheetmetal that was replaced is the driver's side door skin.\nThe Z28 came factory with a high revving\u00a0302ci engine with solid lifters and dual quad holley carburators also known as ''Cross Ram''. It was rated at 290hp but owners found out it really produced around 375hp on the dyno. This 302\u00a0was fully rebuilt to original specs less than one year\u00a0with a more agressive cam for higher horsepower and nice lumpy idle sound. It actually has around 375hp.\u00a0The transmission is the original\u00a0Muncie M22. The rear end is a 3.73 Positraction, this is the original gear ratio, also rebuilt less than a year ago.\u00a0\nThe suspension, direction, bushings, ball joints and bearings were all renewed during the resto. The power steering system has new lines, rebuilt OE control valve and power steering pump. It also came factory with front disc brakes and rear drums.\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nEngine\nDrivetrain\nBody/Exterior\nInterior\nBrakes\nSuspension / Handling\nWheels / Tires\nElectrical System\n\u00a0\nSerious Inquiries Only, No Trades, Thank You!\n",

        "description": "Currently this 1971 Oldsmobile 442 W30 2 door hardtop proudly displays it's original color Matador red with black accent striping on sides and hood. Fiberglass (W25) Outside Air Induction hood with lock down hood latches and fiberglass rear wing. Original date coded SSIII wheels painted to Matador red body color. Complete new black bucket seat interior including headliner, Rally Gauge Pack, power steering and front disc brakes. The original motor is long gone but it currently has the Factory Warranty 455 cubic inch replacement engine (rebuilt). There is no VIN stamped on block pad. The pad is still cast and has never been machined. Original date coded aluminum intake manifold and also original to the car is the M22 4 speed Rock Crusher transmission (rebuilt) with original Hurst shifter and center console. The car also features the original \u201cTO\u201d coded rear end with 3:73 gears and an added W27 rear end cover along with an aluminized exhaust system.\u00a0\u00a0Red inner fenders, new windshield, new bumpers and an odd, not often seen option, is the B85 window reveal trim molding. Extremely clean inside, outside and underneath. In my opinion this is\u00a0a high number 2 car. I have documented the restoration of this car on a thumb drive with about 200 photos. Furthermore, I have a 2-3 inch folder that contains receipts of parts, labor and titles from previous owners from years gone by. My research has indicated the production numbers for 1971 Oldsmobile 442 W30 is 810 hardtops and 247 4 speed cars. The 442 styling and color combination make this W30 a constant head turner and gets the thumbs up where ever she goes.\nI purchased the car from a co-worker approximately 11 years ago. He was not the first owner. Possibly the second or third owner. The best that I can recollect from his story is that over 20 years ago or so, he dated his wife in this car. Then a variety of issues came about, mainly leaks but the car was still running good. Shortly after getting married and buying a house the car went into hibernation in his garage and had been sitting in his garage for about 15 years. The odd but true story is that he and his wife bought a modest house with a 1 car garage. So up until the time I bought the car his and his wife's daily cars sat outside while the W30 was garaged. When I met this co-worker I already had a 71 442 convertible. He asked me to come by his house to show his wife what a restored 442 looked like and take a look at his 442. This next part I remember very well. When he opened the garage door it just hit me that I had not asked him (if by some outside chance) it was a W30 and he said yes it was and it was also a 4 speed car. As I entered the garage I saw the \u201cW30\u201d badges on the side of the fender. The next day in work he asked me if I would be interested in buying his 442 W30. I wasn't looking for a project car but I couldn't turn down a W30. So we struck up a deal with one stipulation, that I would restore the car and not part it out. I agreed, purchased the car and started on an approx. 1 year complete frame off rotisserie restoration.\nI don't know every detail about the history of this W30 and neither did my co-worker friend that I bought the car from. But through my years of (on and off) research I have compiled what I believe is the history of this car. This car was built in May of 1971. It appears that during the warranty period the motor was damaged. It also appears the motor was replaced with a 1972 W30 Factory Replacement Block and possibly Heads. Being that the car was originally built in May of 1971 that left only 2 months of 1971 manufacturing before the factory would start tooling up for the 1972 models. So that is why I believe within those 2 months or while the car was still under warranty, the motor was damaged and replaced with the 1972 motor.\nFinally, along with the car goes 4 extra date coded wheels, misc. stainless steel trim, a die cast model and a car cover.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

        "year": "1964",
        "description": "After purchase in 2005, mechanically this car has been almost entirely rebuilt. Originally was a floor plan unit ordered by Studebaker Memphis and left the South Bend factory on September 17, 1963. Car was delivered to first owner for near list price one year later. Has dealer installed air conditioning, which is almost exactly the same installation as from factory. Factory options included the climatizer (heater), disk brakes, and the 3-speed Power Shift transmission. The original odometer read in the 80,000 range, but inspection of the condition of things indicated a lot more than that, but maybe not a roll-through to 180,000. The entire speedometer quit about ten years ago, and was replaced by a \"brand new\" out-of the box NOS unit. It now reads @3,200 miles since then. The car is driven only in the summer, and only around town.\nThe car comes with the records of all done to it after purchase. A lot. Actually, almost everything. The front end completely rebuilt. The engine was torn completely out and entirely rebuilt from boiling the block to new pistons, hard valve seals, and just about everything else. The multi-page initial repair bill comes with the car. It was essentially a new 289 and Powershift transmission attached to a rebuilt front end as well as attention to the 3.31 rear end.\nPertronics electronic ignition has been installed.\nThe rebuilder - Mountain High Performance - was known as the regional Studebaker expert, as the owner started out working at Denver's largest Studebaker dealer. There are a lot of things specific to Studebakers that traditional mechanics can miss.\nAccessory components also replaced later on. Replaced AC compressor and clutch in @ 2007. Did blow cold, but have left it alone since then, mainly because when you need AC, weather is hot. That means the constriction of air due to the front condenser makes the car run hot, too. So, here driving up and down the Colorado mountains in the summer, it has not been used. A new alternator installed in 2012, as well as a new power steering ram and kit in 2017.\nHas Studebaker AM/FM radio - rare for 1963-64 - which can likely be brought back to life. These cars only had one speaker - in the back - so surround sound isn't in the cards.\nSummary: Now, about 6,000 miles on a completely and professionally rebuilt 289, starting with boiling the block and moving up from there. Hardened valve seats installed with new bearings, high compression pistons, and installation of 4-barrel manifold and new Edelbrock carburetor, raising the engine to essentially 225HP JetThrust configuration. Front end reworked. Drives very nice. Studebakers tend to be prone to vapor lock with today's gasoline. An auxiliary electric fuel pump is installed to assure flow and can be turned on when necessary.\nIn the 17 years since re-build, traditional Studebaker leaks have come back, but none apparently are anything serious. A couple of drips here there, probably.\nThe car has been owned by people interested in collecting. It appears that the exhaust system (dual) was somewhat newer when it arrived here. Front and rear bumpers were either NOS or rechromed and, while stock, were obviously not the parts on the car when it first left South Bend. Orher than a minor chip on the front cowl, the chrome is really excellent. Other brightwork is ok and there are a couple of pieces extra.\nThe real value of this 64 Hawk is its mechanicals. I wanted a 64 Hawk I could drive, not necessarily win shows. Cosmetically, it has been pretty much left alone. Please understand that appearance-wise this car is a 20-footer. Over the years some liberties have been taken with attachment of some brightwork, and the re-paints are several kilometers from perfect. Have not found any meaningful rust.\nThis Hawk is great for everyday driving and going to the local classic car shows. Because the mechanics have been addressed, it would be perfect for someone wanting to use it as a solid base for addressing the cosmetic flaws. The headliner, wind lace, and upholstery are okay, but are worn.. The point here is that they are all attached to a Studebaker into which a lot of investment has been made in making it mechanically sound.\nThe interior is pretty much original. Bucket seats are comfortable. Carpet was replaced, probably. The dash has the tachometer, which was an option the car did not originally leave the factory with.. A sending unit from an Avanti was located and it works fine. The clock was the original electric-wind unit from the factory. It was rebuilt with a quartz movement by Auto Instruments and keeps time perfectly. Other gauges work great, and there are a couple of back-up gauges in the trunk. Gas gauge sender has been replaced, but it still reads whatever it feels like. The important gauges - oil, temp and amps - work.\nThe 3-speed floor shift PowerShift automatic transmission was completely re-built. Still has 2nd-gear start, with selected 1st gear start. Very smooth runner. Current TigerPaw tires have @ 1,500 miles on them and ride great.\nA lot of paperwork comes with this. The original dealer sticker, and the build document from the factory, also. The sales document from when it was first sold at a Mississippi dealer indicates that the buyer seemed to have paid full sticker for the car. And financed it too. Most of the invoices from the work done on the car come with it.\n\u00a0\n",

It has always been garaged and rarely driven. At 84,455 miles and I inheriting it, I discovered (due to lack of being driven) it need a new engine. I had a new 4.1 Jasper engine installed by GM Specialist Inc. on Dixie Highway in Waterford, Mich. on 3/21/2000. The odometer now show 18,500 miles on the new motor. After driving it down to my second home in Bonita Springs, Florida (gar, aged) I had a new exhaust system installed, new headliner, tinted windows, die-hard battery, upper and lower ball joints, idler arm, front suspension drive axle, bushings and air-conditioning converted to the new system-although on the drive back to Michigan (I sold my home in Florida) it stopped working. ? This is a great car, they don't make them like this anymore. Power everything, seats. steering, antenna windows they all work great. You won't be disappointed in this ride. The only other thing I will mention is there are some plastic parts next to the bumper that need to be replaced. According to the LaSalle and Cadillac Club this is a common replaceable part. Don't hesitate to contact me to ask any questions. I would love to keep this gem, but I have only so much time to drive the other vehicles I own.\n",

NEWLY 2019-2020 REBUILT Aluminum Block V-8 Engine (ABOUT $12K) with less than 1000miles on the rebuild (500 of those were purposely put on for post-rebuild adjustments) - done with Mercedes factory parts by a German owned/operated Mercedes Specialist shop and have all receipts. NEWLY STRIPPED AND PAINTED (JULY 2020) at cost of over $10k, NEWLY CHROMED BUMPERS )($2.5k),NEW MICHELIN XWX 205/70VR14 TIRES ($1.6k) summer 2020 with less than 200miles on them - same as Ferraris had in the 70's & 80's as couldn't bear to put on anything but the best), NEW REAR WINDSHIELD (we're told was last one in the world, shipped in from Dubai) All Modern Amenities including air conditioning (needs a/c hose and washer fluid pump which we keep trying to get but warehouses/parts network in Germany not presently functioning well for these older parts), power windows and power steering. Factory Sunroof. Spare Tire, Comprehensive Service Records.\nI've had the car since 1992 and have driven it about 4-5,000 miles since. Had it up to 150mph through the desert on the way back from California after I bought it there so the top factory speed of 143 is incorrect. Engine was rebuilt as it was burning oil and now it's fine - all the receipts are in hand and it was done by a German owned and operated small import repair shop in Chicago as referenced above. The German owner (they specialize in Mercedes) would probably be happy to answer questions about the rebuild and the car upon special request but I don't want to burden him with calls at this point. Likewise the car was stored for a long time and I wanted to get it back to 100% shape looks wise so I had Joe Filek at Captain America Designs in Hampshire, Illinois (people ship him their cars from all over the country and he is backed up about 2-3 years) do all the stripping and body work at a cost in excess of $10k and had him re-install the re-chromed bumpers.\nUpdate 8/8/2022- although $2k Climate Control Servo installed the system needs some kind of repair on that.\u00a0\nThis Mercedes-Benz manufactured Homologation Special Edition was specially built in production form to qualify for FIA racing standards, meaning in order to competitively race Mercedes-Benz had to create at least 1000 production vehicles to accompany official rally cars it wanted to race competitively.\nThe 450SLC 5.0/500SLC coupes were produced by Mercedes-Benz from 1978 to 1981 and are among the rarest post-war models. They were manufactured by Mercedes Benz to homologate (make competition race worthy) the 5 liter for road rally purposes. Some cars were competitively campaigned with factory support, but the rest of the production was sold to the European market to meet homologation guidelines.\nThe combination of the lighter weight and higher horsepower made for a quick and competitive car which raced successfully with the introduction of the 5 liter\u00a0engine in the World Rally Championship Series including First Place finishes in 1979 and 1980 at the Ivory Coast Rally. Other notable participation in competition included the Rally of Argentina, Rally of New Zealand, Acropolis Rally and Portugal Rally. The cars were given massive factory support under the leadership of Eric Waxenberger. The fact that the Managing Board of MBAG officially withdrew from world rallying in 1980 makes the 5.0 the last factory-sponsored wholly Mercedes model. The rally racing clock for Mercedes-Benz ended for good with the success of this homologated SLC special.\nThe Last photo in the gallery is of500SLC Rally cars - Four 450 SLC 5.0 being cleaned at a rally in 1979\nAlong with the performance enhancements and plaudits which are detailed below, this car's comfort and daily drivability combined with every modern amenity led renowned championship drivers of the time period to use them as personal get-arounds.1979 World Champion Driver of Ferrari Team Jody Scheckter chose this as his personal car. Jean Pierre Ganier and Patrick Depailler of the Tyrrell Formula 1 team also chose the 500 as their daily drivers.\n2769 of the 500SLC's were made over 2 years in 1980-81 and fewer than 100 cars were imported into the United States. In 1999 Mercedes-Benz SLC specialist Bob Hatch of Hatch and Sons estimated that at most there might be 50 of these cars in the country good enough to interest a collector, but in the years since his statement, given the drivability of the these cars, there are certainly significantly less than that at present. The example be offered here is certainly in the very top echelon of those Mr. Hatch was speaking of due to its meticulous care over the years and frankly I'd be surprised if there's one in better condition after the engine rebuild and bodywork/painting re-chroming, re-'tiring'- and all the miscellaneous new parts - anywhere.\nThis example differs from the stock 450SLC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in several important and distinctive ways. The hood and trunk lids are made from aluminum for significant weight savings. The car weighs 3,333lbs, 220lbs less than the standard SLC. To emphasize the lengths to which MB went to upgrade the car for homologation, it even has an alloy air cleaner to add to the weight savings. The front and rear aerodynamic spoilers the factory added result in a 9 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 % reduction in wind resistance and a top speed which exceeds 142MPH. The 5.0 is the very first Mercedes-Benz aluminum block V-8 production motor and is lighter than the standard iron block . It produces in excess of a whopping 300 HP and 350lbs of torque and true blacktop powerhouse in its day. The 5.0 engine features factory reworked heads with larger valves, pressure fed valve adjusters, cross-bolted main bearing caps (4bolt mains in hot rod parlance) and many other special tweaks. The 500SLC also features the upgraded 4-speed automatic.\nThere's a window until late October/early November where this car is for sale/viewing/driving as it won't see a drop of rain or snow and certainly not salt while it's under my care.\n\u00a0\n",

A clock is located in the center of the dashboard above the radio. With 500 miles added during current ownership, the odometer reads 78,367 miles but the true mileage on this vehicle is unknown.\nPower is provided by a Ford flathead V8 engine and backed by a three-speed manual transmission. Engine accessories include finned heads with chrome acorn nuts, an aftermarket intake with dual carburetors, chrome\u00a0air cleaners, a remote oil filter, and a chrome breather cap.\nThis Ford sedan was factory-equipped with an independent front suspension and a solid rear drive axle.

The amount of attention this car gets is\u00a0unbelievable.\u00a0 If you want something that you rarely see and that no everyone has, this may be the right car for you! See below.\u00a0\nGTM Gen II was acquired in 2016 and the build was completed late in 2018. It was assembled and completed by a professional shop.\nThe car is based on a tubular frame chassis (this is the Gen II that came out in 2012. So any issues with the Gen I where\u00a0perfected\u00a0and modified for the Gen II's), and the composite body is finished in yellow over a black interior (had thoughts of wrapping the car in a different color. I am not a fan of yellow). Power is provided by a mid-mounted GM Crate 6.2-liter LS3 V8 paired with a new Mendeola SDR5 five-speed manual transaxle for maximum horsepower (not a Porsche transaxle), and additional equipment includes a custom roof scoop, carbon fiber rocker panels, 18\u2033 wheels, C5 Corvette-sourced braking and suspension components, a Kooks exhaust system, air conditioning, a Pioneer multimedia receiver, and more as detailed below. This Factory Five GTM is now offered with build records and a clean Arkansas title listing the car as a 1964 Ford GT coupe. This is not a donor car. Everything is BRAND new on the car. Either bought from GM or directly from the manufacture.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bodywork is composed of aluminum and composite panels over a high-strength steel space frame chassis with an integrated six-point roll cage and contoured roof bars. This Car is finished in yellow with a black vinyl stripe and is fitted with optional carbon fiber rocker panels as well as a functional roof scoop. Additional equipment includes aluminum VRaptor Speedworks louvers, fog lights, and a rear carbon diffuser.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Staggered 18\u2033 Forgestar wheels measure 9\u2033 wide up front and 12\u2033 in the rear and are wrapped in Nitto tires sized 245/40 and 335/30, respectively. The General Motors-sourced suspension features custom adjustable coil overs with Koni dampers, and braking is handled by C6 Corvette calipers over vented and cross-drilled rotors (front and back). 6 piston calipers I have also installed high\u00a0performance\u00a0dustless\u00a0break pads.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cabin is finished in black with yellow trim on the center console.

The digital odometer shows just under 1,900 miles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mid-mounted 6.2-liter LS3 V8 crate engine is paired with a Mendeola SDR5 five-speed manual transaxle. A custom wiring harness was supplied by SMC Performance of Auburn Hills, Michigan and additional electrical wiring was provided by Painless Performance Products of Fort Worth, Texas. A Kooks stainless steel headers and exhaust system exits from either side of the license plate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The battery, master cylinders (Wilwood set up including break pedals), (Vintage air extreme) air conditioning components, and a Dewitts radiator with twin electric fans are located under the ducted composite hood. An eight-minute narrated video provided below details the equipment and includes in-car driving footage. Alot of attention and detail was put into this cooling system with oversized radiator and fans.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI purchased the vehicle for my Girlfriend and after 3-4 times of driving it she felt cluster phobic in the car. She has had some pretty exotic cars and said this car drove and handled better than any other car she had. We both agree on that. We also both agreed the car \"floated on air\".\n\u00a0\n\u00a0I had over 36 cars and sold a bunch and not really interested in trades but if you have something you can text me at 501-844-0000.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

Bob settled in Lompoc, CA. and began drag racing\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTHE OLD GOAT\u201d. \u00a0\u00a0Bob (he\u2019s passed now) said that 12,000 to 14,000 of the miles on the odometer are from being \u00a0\u201cflat towed\u201d to the various drag strips around Southern California. There is tons of race history included with the car along with a large inventory of parts. \u00a0More on that later. The car was raced in the mid to late 60\u2019s. Included are lots of time slips from local drag strips in the 1960\u2019s \u2026.Santa Maria Drag Strip, Riverside Raceway, Lyons Drag Strip and The Pomona Winternationals. Lots of other drag racing memorabilia, brochures from the 1968 & 1970 Winternationals in Pomona, CA\u2026with his name and car listed in them. There is a hand written letter signed by Ed Pink, responding to Bob\u2019s inquiry about some engine work on the GTO.\u00a0 Original owner\u2019s manual and warranty book with the protect o plate.\u00a0The original M20 transmission is included.\u00a0 It currently has a M22 and the required scatter shield. \u00a0Posi-traction rear end with 4:11 gears. \u00a0Original interior. No one has ever sat in the back seat except 2 kids, once, by the previous owner. Bob red-lighted at the start of the 1970 Winternationals and that was it for \u201cTHE OLD GOAT\u201d. He was so frustrated, he quit\u00a0drag racing and parked the car in his hanger where it sat for 21 years and he refused to sell it. He finally called the 2nd owner, and he bought it and owned it for 28 years. He was a body and paint guy in Lompoc and repainted the car to the original color. The paint job is show quality. \u00a0Original spare, jack and jacking instructions on the \u201ctrunk sticker\u201d is still there. Everything works! Included with the car\u00a0are\u00a0the original M & H drag slicks (still hold air and no checking on the sidewalls).\u00a0 Also included are tons of 35MM slides and 8mm movies, original factory repair manual,\u00a0 Book signed\u00a0by GTO Guy Pete McCarthy..

There were a few things that needed to be maintained on the car but the restoration held up nice. As the new owner I felt it my job to maintain the car for the next owner so ive gone through the car and repaired all that i could find that had to be done. The car not only looks great it also runs great. The 312 motor was in perfect shape and needed no attention at all to start enjoying. Unfortunately my wife does not enjoy riding in such a small vehicle so I find im not driving it much. But if your one of those that loves that look of the old tbirds or\u00a0just wants to pick up that special lady for an evening she'll never forget this is the car for you\n",

Needs some work on mechanical, electrical and bodywork. Engine sounds great but has some issues with being a cold starter. Transmission works, but also has issue of leaking and needing topped off here and there. Needs suspension work. Recent work on back brakes. They are drum brakes. Steering seems loose and squirrely. We put power steering in it a few years ago, so it's probably related to that. I do not consider it safe to drive at the moment. The few times we've taken her out for a spin lately, the radiator seems to get hot, but comes with a replacement radiator that we bought but didn't get put on. Not entirely sure that it's even needed, but it will go with the truck anyhow.\nAs mentioned, a bonafide mechanic special! We have had some work done on the body over the years and there is a lot of bondo on it. Still needs work done on it if you're picky about things being perfect. Interior top of cab in particular needs work. See photos. The hood doesn't want to shut\u00a0 down flat like it should, it's raised up some as can be seen in photos, probably needs to be adjusted. This is a newish issue so we haven't really looked into it.\u00a0\nThe windshield is cracked, I think it's got a bb gun or rock impact crack.\nComes with newish truck cover that works great for when you have it parked outside!\u00a0\nThis truck is not safe to drive on the roads currently, so buyer will have to arrange transport. I will not let anyone drive it away unless they live down the block.\n",

A masterpiece of engineering, a beauty to drive and admire, it was way ahead of its time.This car makes the perfect addition to any collection. A great car to drive, in excellent condition and an investment in the future.\nThe semi-automatic transmission, \u2018Sportomatic\u2019, became optional from the late 1960's. This particular car, the 3.0-litre engine 911SC Targa model, was introduced in 1977 and built until 1983. Porsche ceased manufacture of the \u2018Sportomatic\u2019 in 1982 having produced relatively few cars over a 5 year period, making this car today a rare car indeed. A right hand drive vehicle, it is probably the only one of its kind in the USA.\nI purchased this 1979 air cooled Porsche in London, England in 1982. I brought the car to the USA in 2010 and having made the journey from England the car was completely checked and serviced, including a full Engine and Gearbox rebuild.\nIn his introduction to the 1990 Original Classic Car Calendar, in which this car is featured, Stirling Moss reflected on a time when motoring was fun and sums up the pleasure of owning this type of vehicle.\nA unique car from the days when cars were built with care and devotion by craftsmen.\n",

The original owner passed in 2020 and left it to his daughters. It is a factory red car with white interior. A restoration was started but never completed the engine runs good and the transmission shifts good, the rear end is in good shape as well. The car has power brakes and power steering. The paint is in good shape but it is not a show car by any means most of the interior is with the car the seats and carpet are\u00a0in good shape the door panels are in good shape as is the headliner although a new one is included. It has probably been driven less than 30 miles in the last 25 years. The trim tag is missing but the VIN shows it as a 68 charger R/T with a 440 375 hp engine. All the body panels are original except the quarter panels and they were replaced with panels from Year One. The floor pans and trunk are in good shape there is a couple of small spots that looked to have been patched many years ago. I am a friend of the family and am posting this for them I can send as many pictures as you want of this car. I will be glad to get it up in the air and take pictures of the undercarriage as well. Again this is not a show car it does need to be finished with some work it would be a solid driver but if your looking for a Mecum car or perfection this is not for you. They are negotiable on the price but within reason.\u00a0 Thank you\u00a0\n",

I have driven it long distances (60 miles round-trip) and even on the highway with no issues. It\u2019s only an 18 HP engine so it\u2019s not quick, but it\u2019ll get up to 60 mph with some time and a downhill grade helps. This little car gets attention everywhere you go and is so much fun to drive. It has a Clean Colorado Title and No accidents. Exact mileage is unknown but the odometer currently reads 2240.\nThe paint is shiny and looks good but up close in a couple areas it does have some signs of aging or scratches (see photos). There is one spot under the front hood, where the battery is at, that has signs of a small rusted out area (see photos). The left rear chrome nudge bar just broke the other day when I lifted, with my hands, the car up from it (stupid on my part). You can usually find on a few Fiat websites a nice used set (left and right) for $100 shipped or just the left piece new for about $80. Parts are pretty inexpensive to purchase for this car, you just have to wait for shipping from Italy/Europe. No other signs of rusted areas are visible or known to the owner. The rear sometimes leaks a couple drops of fluid after a drive. The oil level is always good on the oil stick and it's only been about 500 miles since the oil was changed. This is the only mechanical issue I didn't dive into and fix. Other than that, the car runs and drives great.\n- 4 Speed Manual\n- Rear Wheel Drive\n- Sunroof\n- About 40 mpg\n- New Wheels and Tires (about 200 miles)\n- I had the following work done by a Classic Fiat mechanic when I received the car: rebuild carburetor and jetted for Denver CO altitude, new gaskets, adjust valves, adjust timing, new points, new condenser, new spark plug cables set, new spark plugs, new ignition coil, new starter, replaced tranny boots, transmission fluid flush, oil change\n\u00a0\nApproximate Vehicle size:\n- Length: 10 ft\n- Width: 4.3 ft\n- Ground Clearance: 5 in\n",

        "description": "\u00a0\u00a0 I originally purchased this vehicle in march of 1997. In around 2006 I started a rebuild which lasted a couple years then really did not bother with it too much other that drive it around the neighborhood a couple times a week. Now that I work out of state I am not home but a couple months of the year so do not do much with it anymore. Asides from things like setting ring gear, rebuild of the engines and transmissions, I did all the work myself. If you are serious about bidding I will be happy to answer any questions you have and send you pictures on request. If you are VERY serious you can arrange to come buy and see it in person.\n\u00a0I will be out of the country on vacation from 11/1 until 12/8.\n\u00a0\u00a0 Buyer will have to pick up or arrange for transportation. Title will be signed and keys handed over after funds are clear. If you want to pay cash that is fine. No, I will not accept a personal check o money order.\nFront Axle:\nDana 60 completely\u00a0rebuilt with 5:13 gears and Powertrax Locking differential.\nDana 70, 35 spline outer stubs\nWarn manual locking hubs.\nHas a skyjacker duel steering damper but the bushings need replacing one damper was removed due to bad bushings. These are the only polyurethane bushings that did this on the whole truck.\nRear Axle\n14 Bolt GM 5:13 gears and Detroit\u00a0locker.\n3/4 ton front gm calipers and rotors with laser cut brackets\nThere is no parking break, I was planning to install one in the drive line but never got around to it.\n\u00a0\nBecause of the one tone axles I had to install a 1 Ton Master cylinder as the pedal went to the floor. The booster is original and there is no issue, the truck stops REALLY good. I also replaced the rubber caliper hoses with braided steel\n\u00a0\nSuspension:\nSuper-lift 8\" front and rear springs\n1-2\" doped\u00a0front Heavy Duty shackles\n2\" blocks in rear (to level truck after lift)\nDropped pit man\u00a0arm and raised steering arm\n3\" body lift\nI cleaned the bottom of the rear axle for ground clearance and build a crossover bracket to relocate the shock mounting points maintaining the same geometry.\nThe front bumper is a little of everything bolted together, the upper portion is removable\nThe Chinese hood is of a thinner gauge steel and was a disappointment though I did reinforce it after it bent on the first closing.\nThe right front fender was also a disappointment and does not appear to line up.\nI welded in a new passenger rocker panel the came out REALLY nice though I was not happy with the thickness of the China steal.\nI got rid of a lot of the rust and welded in patch panels for the right bed side above the wheel but was over doing body work at that point.\n\u00a0\nInterior:\nPower leather seats were installed from a later model (at the time) Silverado; the tilt on the passenger seat does not work.\nBecause of the heavy boxes I would have rather not built, I had to put in a more narrow back seat from a Wrangler.\nI have heavily insulated the truck to keep the noise down and the cold air inside.\nIn around 1999 I replaced all the weather striping except for the corner and topper mount windows and all still seems okay.\n\n\u00a0\nAuto Meter Gauges:\nWater temp, Oil Temp, Oil pressure (Mechanical, steel line), Volts, Tachometer, Vacuum\nI installed a steel oil pressure line because the high pressure oil pump popped three electric senders in a row, this is what prompted the install of gauges.\nBecause I only use to drive it once a week or so I have used two dehumidifiers inside it to keep things from growing\nFrame was pulled into spec by Four Star Frame and alignment in Hallandale Florida\nAn updated cross member was installed under the engine to facilitate crossover steering with 2wd steering box\nTwo types of frame reinforcement brackets were installed to support the steering box, this was a weak point in the original design.\nCustom built 1 ton front and rear driveshafts.\n\u00a0\nHooker, once ceramic coated headers (installed in 1997), 2 1/2 pipes cut and re cut to accommodate rear springs, Flow master 3 chamber mufflers. Could really use new exhaust\n\u00a0\nDrive-train:\nSM465 transmission with NP205 transfer case\u00a0and new 10 spine center sleeve, rebuilt before\u00a0installation\nTwin-stick transfer-case shifter, can not be cross-shifted.\n\u00a0\nFour row, all metal radiator installed in 1998\nBecause of the body lift I modified fan shroud with fiberglass making a \"plenum\" so the fan is covered with the shroud and pulls more air over the radiator.\nTwo 10 inch fans installed around 1997 on the condenser.\n\n\u00a0\nEngine:\n350 4 bolt main professionally rebuilt by Accurate\u00a0Machine\u00a0in Ft Lauderdale\u00a0Florida\nHigh capacity oil pan (8 quarts I think)\nDouble roller timing chain\nFlat top pistons\nbored\u00a030 over\nCylinder\u00a0heads resurfaced\u00a0\nStamped steal roller rocker\nEdelbroch Performed Cam and intake\nMSD HEI distributor, coil, and wires\n\u00a0\nQuadrajet carb\nAll hoses (coolant and fuel) replace during rebuild\nFuel sender assemble replaced with new factory unit\nOE fuel pump, replaced again in 2017\nAlways kept tank full.\\\nThe battery was relocated to the rear of the truck and I installed a master shutoff.\nThere are constant hot wires that lead under the dash along with an extra fuse box over the accelerator pedal.\nThe battery cable going to the starter is 00 gauge (too thick, not practical).\nI built a supplemental relay box under the hood with the idea of installing lights, a winch, or whatever in the future.\n\u00a0\nKnown Issues:\nFront windshield cracked.\nLeaking rear axle seals\nAC Compressor front seal leaks,\u00a0 It is an A6 so you may want to have something lighter installed or just have the seal replaced.\nThe bushings in the steering damper disintegrated but oddly enough none of the others have.\nCan set off other people's car alarms when driving through parking lots\n\n\u00a0\n",

The last thing I did was have the original wheels re-powder coated and new Cooper tires installed . I have recently completed a lot of work and it is running great except for some rust issues over the doors I was addressing but have not completed. You will need to complete the body work and some odds and ends here and there. The only real issue I have ever had was this car likes to eat IAC motors for some reason. It may be an problem with the wiring harness but have never got so far to figure it out. Another nuisance is the A/C only works on Max Cold as the blend door motor was stuck on heat so I unplugged it and \u201cpersuaded\u201d it to remain on cold. This can be fixed if you decide to dissect the dash board as the engineers started with the actuator and then built the car around it. Overall I have always strived to keep it OE with the only exception being the test pipes temporary installed to diagnose an exhaust back pressure issue.\n\u00a0\nAs I do work out of state, I will arrange to meet the buyer at my home for the transaction. I will be on vacation between 11/1 to 12/8\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOriginally purchased in November of 2001 with 40,000 miles, I was the second owner.\nOil changes performed every 3000 miles, synthetic oil used.\nTransmission fluid changed every 20,000 miles.\nVehicle was painted 2 times since purchase and is due to be painted again.\nVehicle stored under car cover with dehumidifier inside while I am out of town.\nThe majority of recent work has been listed below along with some items as far back as 2019\nAir suspension has been maintained over the years.

        "description": "1968 Bronco high end restoration, uncut, frame off\u00a0rotisserie, no expenses spared, professionally done with no rust or cover ups.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is my 5th Bronco restoration that I have done in the last 7\u00a0years and by far this is the best one.\u00a0 It was to be my personal Bronco that I planned on driving for a long time\u00a0so a lot of special details and money went into it.\u00a0 This was a 2-year project.\u00a0 Unfortunately I had to have multiple surgeries and the last one this year was a\u00a0shoulder replacement\u00a0so it doesn't allow me to enjoy the vehicle as I had planned.\u00a0 It has less than\u00a0500 miles since it was built.\nI have been building cars for 50 years and it is my passion.\u00a0 My team consisted of 2 other guys with extreme automotive experience who worked with me on all my Bronco builds.\u00a0 We thought about putting a Coyote motor in but after talking to friends who have purchased classics with Coyote motors and realized the problems that come with the modification that most people do not talk about in a vehicle this size.\u00a0 Some of our acquaintances have rolled the vehicle due to excessive power and short wheel base and height as well as some twists in the frame so this made me decide to put in the 289, which is reliable, with the upgrades giving it approximately the same horsepower as a 302.\u00a0 With the 5 speed it is super fun and very responsive, all the power that an older classic Bronco needs to enjoy this truck to the maximum\u00a0 (these motors were very reliable).\u00a0 The crate motor I put in was a long block with a RV cam and had only 6,000 miles on it.\u00a0 It came to me painted red and I repainted it in the Ford blue and replaced all the outer components as listed below.\u00a0 Out of all the Broncos I had this one drives, steers and handles as well as my new Ford pickup.\u00a0 I wanted it to have a good clean look, no side markers, no side trim and extra insulated for it to be very quiet when driving, not a rattlebox.\u00a0 The smaller tire size that it is photographed in is so that the wheels stay inside the fender wells which is one of the reasons why it steers and handles well.\u00a0 There is plenty of fender clearance for these wheels as well as the extra set of larger wheels that come with it which will protrude\u00a01 1/2 inches outside the fenders (see details below).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You will not find another one that looks like this, clean, simple, retro inside, custom engine bay and totally restored bumper to bumper.\u00a0\nHas always been in a heated garage.\u00a0I have all the photos and receipts on the build from start to finish.\u00a0 I have the original side glass for the top and 2 brand new chrome side mirrors for the doors if desired.\nIf you are seriously interested please contact me with any questions and\u00a0I will send you videos of it running and driving.\nShipping transport should be enclosed and from Missoula, MT.\n\u00a0\nThe following parts are all new unless stated rebuilt:\u00a0\nBody:\nfront fenders, hood, grill, door skins, rear tail light housing (welded in no seams for a cleaner look), tailgate, inner fenders, complete glass, window hardware upgraded kit no wing windows no noise, 3 coats of 3M rubber undercoating including fenders, custom rock guards inside fenders, fuel tanks, fill necks, stainless steel gas lines, skid plate, bumpers front and rear, stainless steel step bar and rock guards, Bimini\u00a0half top, custom side windows tinted with flush mount slide vent, chrome license plate holder, chrome exterior door handles, tailgate (all new internal workings with cable rods) and inside handles, weatherstripping, keys and locks door jams, floor pans, approximately $2,000 stainless steel bolts, hydraulic hood and rear window lifts, new red Hi Jack spare tire jack.\nTub was replaced with a newer refurbished tub.\nPaint:\n2 coats of primer sealer, 4 coats of color - wet sanded after each coat, 3 coats of clear, cut and buffed.\u00a0 All work was done in my shop.\u00a0 High end paints were purchased including hardener, reducer, seam sealers and skim coats, all top brands.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDrivetrain/Suspension:\n\u00a0AX1500 five speed transmission with Hurst shifters and new custom CMS driveshafts, TBP 2 \u00bd lift suspension front and back, dual shocks all four wheels, Wilwood hydraulic clutch, high performance clutch pressure plate and flywheel, Dana 40 stainless steel 1 inch axles, TBP disc brake kit with new hubs, steering box, power steering pump, brake lines with braided lines to the wheels, emergency brake assembly and cable, sway bar and adjustable linkage, Rebuilt Dana 20 transfer case, Ford 9-inch rear end and Dana front gears 3.51 ratio\nInterior:\nIdit tilt steering column, custom black interior, dash cover, center console, shifter boot, headliner, sun visors, complete carpet kit with 1/4-inch rubber backing, Line-X cab floor, Vintage Air A/C and Heater system, custom steering wheel, custom rear view mirror, foot petals and covers, shift knobs.\nMotor/Transmission/Exhaust:\n289 high performance crate motor with a few changes I did\u00a0(Speedmaster\u00a0electronic ignition system, Edelbrock intake manifold, Holley 650 carburetor), Billet pulleys, high capacity electric fan, all hoses rubber and metal, Billet air cleaner and valve covers, 3 core aluminum radiator, water pump, gas pump, ceramic coated long headers, James Duff exhaust system, chrome overflow tank, power steering pump,\nTires & Wheels:\nBF Goodrich All Terrain KO2 (LT255/70R16), Raceline chrome custom wheels and spare.\u00a0 Comes with an extra set of new BFGoodrich All Terrain KO2 33X10x15 with old school vintage Mickey Thompson aluminum polished rims for off road adventures and fits vehicle.\u00a0\nElectrical:\nPainless wiring system, LED lights front and rear, Intellitronix digital gauges, 800 Amp Ford battery, marine windshield wiper motors, high amp output alternator 1 wire, ignition, all dash switches, stereo (Bluetooth/Airplay) and speakers, chrome bad boy train horn.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

        "description": "Some folks are lucky enough to be able to own multiple Corvettes. But for most there is only enough garage and budget space for one. So, which do you choose? Do you go for a brand-new showroom fresh model for nearly 200K? Or do you keep it old school and go for a classic Corvette?\u00a0 There are some compelling reasons why getting a classic Corvette is the way to go, and why\u00a01963 is a special year.\nThis C2 classic has a completely new black vinyl upholstery and carpet package. It is powered by a 327ci V8 paired with HEI distributor, new exhaust and optional four-speed Posi-traction manual transmission. Optional equipment includes\u00a0a new white convertible soft top and also a freshly painted pearl white hardtop, 15\u2033 rally wheels, power assist\u00a0brakes, a telescopic steering column,\u00a0a push-button AM/FM radio, LED headlights and new auto glass.\nOriginal rally wheels are mounted with new 215-60R15 Kelly \u201cCharger\u201d tires. The C2 was the first Corvette to offer fully independent suspension, with upper and lower control arms at the front and a three-link setup with a transverse leaf spring at the rear.\nThe three-spoke steering wheel is mounted on a telescopic column and frames a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, amperage, oil pressure, and water temperature. The five-digit odometer shows approximately 47k original miles, over 1000 of which were added under current ownership. The refurbished 327ci V8 engine is equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and finned aluminum valve covers. The restoration\u00a0includes a new electronic windshield wiper system being\u00a0installed by\u00a0our favorite Corvette shop Rollings Automotive. A new parking brake that is on backorder will also be included.\n",

        "description": "1966 MGB GT purchased April 2022 from E&R Classics in the Netherlands. It arrived to me in August after shipping delays. The document package included all maintenance records and Heritage Certificate from original owner. I was assured by the E&R representative that it was a good solid car and all systems were working fine and it was ready to drive. But as it goes with on-line purchases, there are always issues to be resolved. The first drive proved that all systems were working fine, all gages working, good oil pressure, good brakes and no unusual sounds. However, there\u00a0were issues to get the car to where I feel confident to take it on the road. The project entailed being a serious MOSS MOTORS customer. I replaced the wiring harness with a new fabric cover system. Also replaced battery cables, new dash switches, solenoid, voltage regulator and a battery cutoff switch. Converted to negative ground and replaced tach with proper negative ground type. Externally I replaced grill (the previous owner\u00a0had painted the vertical bars). The shiny grill made the bumpers look dull, so I replaced front and rear bumpers and overriders. Added auxiliary hood release. Replaced exhaust with stainless steel system. Replaced weatherstripping on doors and hatch along with window channels, vent window seals, rider and driver window glass (had scratches on originals) and rebuilt regulators. Replaced both windshield wheel box assemblies along with new wiper arms and blades. Sand blasted, primed and painted all five wire wheels. Replaced front rotors and pads. In the interior, I added sound deadening on floors and replaced all carpeting. The seats were rebuilt with new diaphragms, new foam and black leather with red piping. Same for rear seat. For the engine compartment, I added aluminum radiator, replaced fan and hub, replaced all hoses, clamps and grommets for\u00a0water, oil and fuel. Replaced heater control valve and all control cables. All removeable pieces were sandblasted, primed and painted with all new hardware.\u00a0\nIt was a busy year getting this MGB GT ready. I am retired and enjoy working an cars and getting them to a point where I feel confident and proud to drive them. In my early years I had a blue 67, a primrose 71 and a damask 74. I ordered it early after seeing the pictures of the new rubber bumper model, so\u00a0I was able to get chrome bumpers. All were GT models as I like the style. That followed with muscle cars, street rods and classics. My problem now is I had recent back surgery which limits my ability to do these projects so I must sell. I am located in Central Virginia and the car is always kept\u00a0in a conditioned garage. I have documentation of all work that I have done as well as manuals and various leftover parts that I purchased while doing the work. While this is not a Concourse grade car, it is a quality dependable car for taking to local shows and fun drives.\n",

Work includes refinishing the exterior in metallic copper and installation of a 5.0 liter V8 and an automatic transmission said to be sourced from Mustang GT and features a BBK SSI Manifold and cold-air intake system, tubular headers linked to a dual exhaust system, Ford Racing-logo valve covers, and an aluminum radiator. Power is routed to the rear wheels via an automatic transmission and ten-bolt rear end housing a limited-slip differential. Fuel tank was fitted after the rear axle, and additional photos showing the suspension, chassis, and bed are presented in photo gallery.\u00a0\u00a0This truck is also modified with four-wheel disc brake conversion, a limited-slip differential, wood planking installed on the step side bed, aftermarket taillights, a dual exhaust system, updates to the interior, and a Vintage Air air-conditioning system. The step side bed features stained wood slats with polished cargo runners and a polished fuel cap is mounted in the floor. Body-color steel wheels are fitted with chrome hubcaps and wear BFGoodrich Silvertown tires. The truck is equipped with disc brakes at all four corners. Trim and hardware were removed while the body was refinished in its current metallic copper finish. Equipment includes body-color running boards, aftermarket taillights, a custom flip-down tailgate, dual mirrors and rectangular exhaust finishers. The finish and trim are shown up close in photo gallery. Bench seat and door panels are trimmed in two-toned upholstery and Daytona-weave carpet lines the floors. Matching upholstery covers the headliner, doors and trim panels, and further additions include a woodgrain steering wheel mounted to an adjustable column, a Kenwood stereo and speakers, powered windows and aftermarket pedals. The cab is equipped with modern air-condition system\u00a0sourced from Vintage Air. True mileage is unknown\u00a0but digital odometer indicates nearly 6,500 miles driven.

        "description": "POWERTRAIN\nWith the V-8 engine from the base Corvette, but the suspension setup, brakes and styling cues of the higher-performance Z06, the Grand Sport is effectively another trim level of the Corvette.\u00a0 The optional dual-mode exhaust system, which added $1,195 to the price of our test car, bumps the V-8\u2019s output to 436 hp.\u00a0 The Grand Sport\u2019s brakes are particularly well executed. They are shared with the high-performance Corvette Z06 and feature 14-inch front and 13.4-inch rear cross-drilled rotors gripped by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers.\u00a0 The Grand Sport uses a suspension setup similar to the Z06\u2019s, as well as wider alloy wheels and tires \u2014 9.5 inches in front and 12 inches in back.\nUnder the hood is the original LS3 V8, rated at 436 horsepower at 5,900 rpm and 424 lb-ft of torque at 4,600 rpm when new. Maintaining the smooth power band of the 6.2-liter engine is easy thanks to the efficient paddle-shifted six-speed automatic transmission. Reviews from its launch state that the car could reach 60 mph in 4 seconds, with a top speed of 190 mph.\nEXTERIOR\nThis Grand Sport is covered in brilliant Torch Red. The paint is flawless with a clay bar smooth finish. The Grand Sport option is noted on chrome inserts above the vents just behind the front wheels.\u00a0 A tasteful body colored rear spoiler was professionally installed in addition to several interior and exterior carbon fiber-look accents ($5000).\u00a0 The engine compartment is stock and pristine. The car includes the optional glass top. All the glass is in excellent shape with a professional tint applied and the doors seal tightly with no wind noise or leaks.\nINTERIOR\nThe Light Cashmere leather interior is in \u201clike new\u201d condition and thanks to the 2LT Preferred Equipment Group option features a few more bells and whistles than a standard model. These options include heated sport memory seats with power bolsters and lumbar support and a premium nine-speaker Bose radio that accepts CDs and offers Bluetooth connectivity. All the gauges, heads-up display, dual-zone climate control, and control switches and accessories function properly.\nCHASSIS\nThe Grand Sport option features a wider track (with wide-body styling), revised shocks, stiffer springs, and firmer stabilizer bars to provide even better handling than base model Corvettes. Original chrome wheels holding Nitto Invo tires.\u00a0 Optional dual-mode performance exhaust ($1195) adds an extra 6 hp.\u00a0 The Grand Sport\u2019s brakes are particularly well executed. They\u2019re shared with the high-performance Corvette Z06 and feature 14-inch front and 13.4-inch rear cross-drilled rotors gripped by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers.\u00a0 The Grand Sport uses a suspension setup similar to the Z06\u2019s, as well as wider alloy wheels and tires \u2014 9.5 inches in front and 12 inches in back\nDOCUMENTATION\nThe seller states that this vehicle will be sold on a clean Texas title in his name. This 2010 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport Coupe was purchased when only 3 months old with 6000 miles and has remained in current owner\u2019s possession ever since. Since then, the car has only been used for pleasure driving. The sale will include all factory manuals and custom cover. The owner admits to not driving the car as often as he should and would prefer to see this Grand Sport \u2018Vette being enjoyed on the road instead of sitting in his garage.\n",

Therefore, I know what to look for in a solid classic car. I had a vision of what this car could be and believe the Z28 accents add value to the look of the car. I targeted a black on orange contrast. You be the judge! The following has been done in the last 8 months by me and my selected automotive partners:\n\nThis is a 45k mile car. Original interior, sheet metal all solid outside and inside (all metal car), Underbody excellent, Frame excellent, original wheel wells, doors, fenders, rocker panels, rear frame rails, no rust anywhere, strong 350 cu in/ transmission. All gauges, lights, turn signals functioning as they should (including clock!). A true 45K mile car. Note: MPH on Speedo, this is a US car in origin (If a Canadian car it would be in Kilometers). This car somehow at sometime made its way up to Canada from the USA. Most likely a southern US car because of no rust on the body. Please see all photos and video with the ad. Let\u2019s remind ourselves that GM\u2019s quality in 1976 was not like it is today. This is a 47 year old car, thus the car comes with its quirks and quality from the factory.\u00a0\n\nFraser MacDuffee\n",

        "description": "1959 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible - Fully Restored Show Car - Air Ride - WOW!\nThis breathtaking 1959 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible is in amazing condition inside and out. It is truly a one-of-a-kind show stopper. This was the personal car of a very good friend of mine right here in Scottsdale, AZ. He wanted the nicest, most unique, jaw-dropping Cadillac on the road, and money was no object. It needed to be a '59 Caddy convertible, so I found him the nicest fully restored 1959 Cadillac I could find. He then took it to one of the best custom shops in town and had it equipped with the top-of-the-line computerized air ride system, custom-ordered 22\u201d polished billet Colorado Custom wheels that were created to match the style of the original Cadillac hubcaps, wrapped with custom 22-inch whitewall tires. They finished it off with a completely hidden, insane sound system. The tasteful modifications were done to keep the car's original look but give it a modern twist. The result is a stunning boulevard cruiser that no exotic can match!\nThis was a solid, rust-free car from the start that was completely restored from front to back. Finished in beautiful Seminole Red with all show-quality chrome and trim. Even the entire front and rear billet grilles were completely taken apart and restored. The sides are straight as an arrow with excellent fit and finish. The interior was completely redone in correct red and white and looks amazing against the matching red paint finish. All the chrome inside the car is beautiful, with a perfect dash and fully restored steering wheel and a perfect horn ring. Inside the trunk, it was finished wonderfully in matching red as well. It has a new white soft top with a matching top boot. It just doesn't get any better than this. When he built this car the way he wanted it, he did it with preservation in mind and kept all the original parts to put the car right back to stock if you ever decide to do so.\nThis is just an awesome cruiser that is so much fun to drive. Drop the top, throw your favorite tunes on from your phone, pick up your friends, and have the time of your life cruising this baby on the weekends. I've owned all the exotics, luxury cars you can imagine, and they do not compare to the fun you have in a vintage bagged Caddy like this!\nHighlights:\n\u00a0\nFeatures:\n\u00a0\nCurrent Condition:\n\u00a0\nContact Us:\nDon't miss this opportunity to own a truly stunning and one-of-a-kind 1959 Cadillac convertible.

Finished in a beautiful shade of yellow, with the iconic Road Runner animations and horn, this Satellite has been revamped and renovated into a Road Runner with a 383 V8 with Coyote Duster air system. Other upgrades under the hood include an Edelbrock Eliminator intake manifold, Mopar Performance valve covers, electronic ignition system, MSD wiring and much more. Paired to the engine is a rebuilt 727 automatic transmission which feels smooth while shifting. Outside, the yellow paint shines brightly after a fresh polishing in the Lupo Auto Salon, the Magnum wheels look great with white lettered Mastercraft tires, and the black accents add a nice satin touch. Inside, the all black with wood trim interior shows very nicely. The leather seats appear to be in very good condition and feel comfortable. In the dash sits a Kenwood head unit, paired to Diamond Audio Technology speakers and a Kicker Amplifier in the rear of the car. If you are interested in a Mopar to truly enjoy, this Satellite turned Road Runner appears to be an excellent choice.\n\u00a0\nFeatures Include:\n383 V8 Engine\nElectronic Ignition\nMSD Wiring\nEdelbrock Eliminator Intake Manifold\nMopar Performance Wrinkle Valve Covers\nRebuilt 727 Transmission\nRebuilt CR7 Torque Converter\nRoad Runner Horn\nMagnum Wheels\nKenwood Head Unit\nDiamond Audio Technology Speakers\nKicker Amplifier\nAnd Much More\n\u00a0\nTrim Tag Decode:\nA01 - Light Package\nA15 - Spring Special without Vinyl Top\nL31 - Hood / Fender Mounted Turn Signals\nM21 - Roof Drip Rail Mouldings\nM31 - Belt Moldings\nRM23 - 2 Door Hardtop Satellite\nE44 - 318ci V8\nD31 - 3 Speed Automatic\nH2G - Green Trim\nF8 - Ivy Green Metallic\n\u00a0\nVIN:\u00a0 RH23F9G212151\n\n\n",

The truck was repainted green and fitted with a rebuilt 2.25-liter diesel engine as part of a refurbishment completed in Spain in 2018. It is said to have been subsequently imported to the US and was purchased by the prior owner in 2019. Equipment includes a four-speed transmission, a dual-range transfer case, 16\u2033 steel wheels, disc brakes, a tan removable soft top, and seating for six.\nThe truck was refinished in green during the refurbishment and features a tan removable soft top with roll-up sides as well as a split windshield, sliding side windows, dual fender-mounted mirrors, and a galvanized front bumper, door hinges, and hood hinges.\nBody-color 16\u2033 steel wheels wear 205/80 Insa Turbo Special Track-2 tires, and a spare steel wheel with a matching tire is stored against the bulkhead in the rear cargo area. Braking is handled by discs at all four corners.\nThe cab features bucket seats upholstered in black vinyl along with color-coordinated door panels and all-weather floor mats. Equipment includes cowl vents, a center console, two cup holders, and push-button operation for the glow plugs and ignition. A metal bulkhead separates the cab from the cargo area.\nThe banjo-style steering wheel fronts a body-color dashboard housing a Veglia-Bressel 120-km/h speedometer and a Smiths combination gauge for coolant temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 84k kilometers (~52k miles), and true mileage is unknown.\nThe cargo area features four fold-away jump seats, two storage compartments, and an all-weather floor liner.\nThe 2.25-liter diesel inline-four was reportedly rebuilt in 2018. Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Repairs and patches are visible on the frame.\nRecent maintenance in September 2023, included the following: removed and replaced real axle seals, and transmission seals.\n",

        "description": "ONE OF THE BEST PRICED 12C's on the MARKET TODAY!\u00a0 This MINT 2013 McLaren\u00a0Spider MP4-12C hard-top convertible establishes McLaren as a legitimate player in the elite world of track-ready supercars. This 12C Spider has Vorsteiner (LOOK IT UP!) carbon fiber accents throughout the car - rear spoiler/wing, side skirts, vents, CLEAR PROTECTIVE WRAP, incredible stereo w/ nav, and more. A mid-mounted V8 engine that now makes over 615\u00a0horsepower is at the heart of the McLaren\u2019s enviable performance figures, while a supple 2-seat interior and a surprisingly refined ride help make this quarter-million-dollar car more livable than others in its rarified air. Low miles, immaculately taken care of, never has been on a track, and serviced at an authorized McLaren dealer since purchased new.\u00a0 Read the following to understand why this listing is a screaming buy, beautiful car, and the reason I've owned it for five years vs. getting something else!\u00a0\u00a0\nDriving The Used 2013 McLaren MP4-12C\nEven with all its power and performance abilities, the MP4-12C can be a tame beast when you want it to be. It\u2019s a supercar that won\u2019t fuss about trips to the market. In \"normal\" mode, the chassis quells rough roads with ease. Switch to \"sport\" or \"track\" settings, though, and the McLaren becomes another car. Suddenly, its compliant ride and smooth shifts from the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission are replaced by a ferocity that leaves no doubt about the racecars that inspired the 12C. Turbo lag from the compact V8 engine is nearly nonexistent. The McLaren 12C spider\u00a0has a 0-60 mph time of 3.10\u00a0seconds. The MP4 corners with devastating precision and makes even novice drivers look good thanks to a system that applies brakes when needed to help keep you \u2013 and the car \u2013 in one piece.\nInterior Comfort\nGetting into the McLaren via the upward-opening doors are a nice touch since it allows you to sit on the doorsill before settling into the low designed drivers seat. Once inside, though, the car is quite comfortable. The two seats are appropriately bolstered, and to McLaren\u2019s credit there is even cargo space on a bench behind the seats in addition to the cavity up front near the bumper (remember, this is a mid-engine car). Directly in front of the driver is the large oval instrumentation that will let you know when you\u2019re traveling at jail speeds. This Spider model\u00a0feature a rear glass panel that can be lowered to let in more engine noise in the cabin along with fresh air when the top is up.\nExterior Styling\nThe McLaren has more curves than a supermodel and skin as scintillating as one. Massive air intakes define the MP4\u2019s sides, while even the vertical-opening doors are a work of design magic. Up front, long and trapezoidal headlights are reminiscent of Ferraris, and the rear boasts high-mounted exhausts that howl from above, not below, the bumper. The McLaren\u2019s mid-mounted V8 heart, meanwhile, is displayed under a panel of glass for all to see. Spider models have a 2-piece retractable hardtop and dual-purpose tonneau that protects the retracted roof or, with the roof up, covers a small cargo space.\nMy Favorite Features\nLUXURY RIDE QUALITY\nFOLDING HARD TOP\nStandard Features\nThe \nFactory Options\nThe McLaren can be taken to even higher heights with carbon-ceramic brakes (nearly $14,000 alone), power-adjustable seats, parking sensors, custom interior trims including Alcantara, an upgraded audio system with satellite navigation, and exterior bits that include carbon-fiber engine panels. An upgraded exhaust system that\u2019s lighter and louder than the standard one can be had for even more aural pleasure. A \"Stealth Pack\" doesn\u2019t make the car invisible, but rather finishes the rear airbrake and exhaust pipe in a polished metallic finish, with the aim of giving the 12C a more aggressive rear.\nEngine & Transmission\nThe heart of every McLaren MP4-12C is a twin-turbo V8 engine that has now been tuned to make \nCar is located in Auburn AL (30 min. from Columbus GA).\u00a0 Has been garaged and has only been in rain twice!\u00a0 \u00a0\nVIN# SBM11BSS4DW002008 WITH CLEAN TITLE IN HAND!\u00a0 No trades, no test drives without proof of funds (current bank letter of credit, 3rd party financials, or current bank statement.\u00a0 \u00a0Thanks!\n",

        "description": "Introducing the timeless classic, a 1972 Mercedes 280 SE. This car is more than just a vehicle, it's a piece of history, a testament to the golden age of automotive design. It's not just a car, it's a lifestyle, a statement, a symbol of elegance and sophistication.\nThis beautiful machine has been lovingly cared for by three owners, all of whom have kept it safely tucked away in a garage, preserving its charm and character. It has a new exhaust system including new chrome pipes.\u00a0Its sleek silver exterior, a $5,000.00 recent paint job addition, gleams like a moonbeam, turning heads wherever it goes.\nUnder the hood, the engine purrs like a well-fed cat, with a compression of 150 psi in five of the six cylinders and 145 psi in the remaining one. The tires, though not brand new, still have plenty of life left in them, with 5/32 tread on the front from 2000 and 8/32 on the rear from 2005.\nThe brake pads and rotors are in good condition, ensuring a smooth and safe ride. However, like any classic car, it has its quirks. There are small oil leaks, some radiator corrosion, and the idler arm bushing shows some wear.\nThe interior is a sight to behold, with excellent leather seats that cradle you in comfort. The back of the driver seat is coming loose, but it's a minor issue that should be easy to fix. The front passenger carpet shows fraying. The odometer is inoperable, showing 2050 miles, but we believe it has likely rolled over to 102,050 miles.\nThe car runs beautifully, but does experience some stalling when coming to a stop, which we suspect may be a fuel pump issue. Despite these minor issues, this car is a gem, a true classic that will bring joy to any car enthusiast.\nThis car comes with a treasure trove of original documents, including the maintenance manual from the first owner, the original Mercedes-Benz dealer's book from October 15, 1971, the maintenance booklet, the owner's manual, and the Mercedes-Benz 1970 catalog.\nThis car is being sold on behalf of a dear friend who unfortunately passed away in a motorcycle accident. His widow has made the difficult decision to part with this beautiful machine. This is a unique opportunity to own a piece of automotive history, and to continue the legacy of care and love that this car has always known.\nThis 1972 Mercedes 280 SE is more than just a car. It's a statement, a lifestyle, a piece of history and would be considered in between excellent and good condition. It's waiting for the right person to write the next chapter of its story. Could that person be you?\n",

Toyota built a prototype in 1951, and released the BJ series in 1953 primarily for police and military use and the 1954 civilian version gained the \u201cLand Cruiser\u201d which has stayed with Toyota to date. These go anywhere trucks had the ability to traverse rough terrain with ease and had reliability that was second to none.\u00a0\nThe FJ40 was produced for over two decades, from 1960 to 1983, with various updates and changes made over the years. It has gained a loyal following among off-road enthusiasts and collectors, who appreciate its rugged, no-nonsense design and its ability to handle the toughest driving conditions.\nThis 1968 Toyota FJ40 is a beautifully restored truck complete with a bare metal refinish is gorgeous red! You\u2019ll find more of that gorgeous red paint on the interior as well as a set of functional gauges, recovered seats, refinished interior trim, a restored steering wheel and new rubber trim throughout. The canvas top with ambulance doors is new and looks sharp with the red paint.\u00a0\nThe engine is the tried and true 6-cylinder and is original to the truck. The transmission is a 3-speed and shifts smoothly through the gears. She has fresh fluids throughout and we just performed a tune up.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is a great truck to drive around town and about as reliable as they get! Also, incredible for farm and light offroad use. If you are looking for a nicely built FJ40, this truck turns heads and is a blast to drive.\u00a0\n",

With its updated styling, upscale interior, and six speed manual transmission, it is a top choice for fans of wind-in-your-hair motoring.\nEngine\nThe engine is the iconic 2.0L four cylinder that now, with the Turbo option, cranks an extremely healthy 200 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque. However, the fuel economy is even more impressive, surpassing those of the base model with 21 City and 30 Hwy MPG. The easily shifting six-speed manual transmission rates as one of the best of its type.\nDriving\nThe 2013 Volkswagen Beetle Convertible is an enjoyable car to drive, particularly with the Turbo engine under the hood. It handles very solidly, especially with the sport-tuned suspension that underpins the Turbo model.\nSafety \nStandard safety features include antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control and combination head/thorax front side airbags. Also, standard are roll bars behind the rear seats that pop up in a fraction of a second in a crash.\nInterior\nThe bucket seats are comfortable with excellent bolstering and ample legroom.\nA noteworthy characteristic of this model is that the soft top now folds lower atop the rear deck, that improves rear visibility considerably. The convertible top folds down in less than 10 seconds.\nThe trunk has 7.1 cubic feet of space, that can be expanded by flipping down one or both halves of the 50/50-split rear seatbacks.\n",

        "description": "This 1994 Nissan 300ZX two-seat coupe has been driven 58,218 miles since new and is powered by a VG30DE 3.0-liter V6 paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. It was originally delivered to Wright Nissan in Wexford, Pennsylvania and has remained unmodified throughout its life. Equipment includes removable glass T-tops, four-wheel anti-lock power disc brakes, speed-sensitive power steering, and quad exhaust outlets. Finished in Super White over a charcoal gray cloth interior, this Z32 300ZX is now offered with extra keys, owner's manuals, a window sticker, T-top storage bags, a clean CARFAX report, and a clear title in the seller's name.\nThe Super White (code 326) exterior features integrated fog lamps, removable glass T-tops, a power antenna, quad exhaust outlets, and a rear windshield\u00a0 wiper.\nAluminum five-spoke 16-inch wheels are wrapped in 225/50 GT Radial Champiro UHP tires that were installed earlier this year. The right rear wheel shows signs of curb damage.\nThe two-seat cockpit has dual charcoal cloth bucket seats with patterned inserts, matched to the door panels, upholstered dash, center console, carpeting, and Z-branded floor mats. Features include speed-sensitive power steering, a power driver seat, automatic climate control, power mirrors, power door locks, a Bose AM/FM/CD/cassette radio, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, and a keyless entry system.\nInstrumentation includes a 160-mph speedometer, a 9,000-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for the fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The six-digit mechanical odometer reads 58,218 miles, which lines up with the most recent figure of 56,925 miles recorded on the CARFAX report in February 2023.\nThe VG30DE 3.0-liter, 24-valve V6 was rated at 222 horsepower and 198 lb-ft of torque when new. An oil change was performed in May 2023. Power is fed to the rear wheels via a console-shifted four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential.\nA four-wheel alignment and a brake inspection were performed earlier this year. Stopping power comes from vented anti-lock disc brakes. The suspension uses a four-wheel independent multi-link setup.\nThe CARFAX report begins in 1994 and shows accident-free ownership in Pennsylvania through 2023 followed by relocation to North Carolina. A Pennsylvania emissions inspection was performed in March 2023. The sale includes extra keys, owner\u2019s manuals, T-top storage bags, and a window sticker showing an original retail price of $36,509.\n",

THANK YOU.**\n\u00a0\nBarrett Jackson Description\n\u00a0\nThis magnificent 1970 Mercury Cyclone GT is one of only 73 built with the 429 Super Cobra Jet V8 Drag Pak. The Super Cobra Jet 429-4V V8 was the street version of the Boss 429 racing engine as stated in the original factory Mercury dealership brochure that\u2019s included. It is fully documented with the original Ford (Lois Eminger) Invoice and Elite Marti Report both of which are included. This example was the product of a high level rotisserie restoration with great attention to detail. This vehicle\u2019s order type was an \u201cA Plan Vehicle\u201d which meant it was ordered by an employee of Ford or the selling dealership which in this case was Sesi Lincoln Mercury located in Ypsilanti, MI. It was ordered on September 23, 1969 as a 1970 Mercury Cyclone GT 2-door hardtop with a Competition Yellow exterior and Black Comfortweave Vinyl Hi-Back Bucket Seats interior. It was also ordered with the following options: complete tinted glass, Goodyear G78x14 belted white sidewall tires, courtesy lights, tachometer instrumentation group, electric clock, AM radio, dual rear seat speakers, rear window defogger, power front disc brakes, 429 Super Cobra Jet V8 Drag Pak, four-speed close ratio manual transmission and 3.91 Traction-Lok rear axle. It was built on November 18th, 1969 and sold on November 20th, 1969. From the information gathered this car only had 15,000 original miles prior to the nut and bolt rotisserie restoration which was completed in 2020. The previous and current title states actual mileage. The exterior of this car is in absolutely gorgeous condition throughout. The body is laser straight with great panel fitment. The car was re-finished in its original color of Competition Yellow paint. The high quality paint was recently detailed to a brilliant show quality shine. The Ram Air induction hood, dual racing mirrors, concealed headlights, black lower body-side painted and Cyclone GT 429 emblems scream muscle car. The front windshield was replaced new and all the remaining factory original stamped glass is in beautiful condition. It sits on new 15\u201d Magnum 500 wheels and B.F. Goodrich Radial TA staggered tires that were added in 2023. A set of the original 14\u201dwheels with factory hub caps and B.F. Goodrich Silvertown G78-14 whitewall tires are included. The black comfortweave vinyl interior is mostly original and truly remarkable. The Hi-back bucket seats are still firm and the seat belts still retain all the original date coded tags. The rim-blow sport steering wheel is in front of the 140-mph speedometer. The 8000-rpm tachometer, oil pressure, engine temperature and ammeter gauges are recessed individually into the dash. The painted trunk compartment has a factory style trunk mat, matching spare tire and jack tools. The engine compartment is highly detailed with many correct parts throughout. The car is powered by the original matching numbers 429 Super Cobra Jet V8 engine that was factory rated at 375HP. The decision was made during the rebuild to use higher performance parts for better reliability and increased horsepower. The engine was bored .80 over and stroked to a 533ci. Some of the internals parts include a #4340 forged steel crank, Comp Cam solid roller cam with custom grind, H Beam rods, Auto Tec forged pistons and Comp Cam Pro Magnum roller rockers. It has the factory intake and Holley carburetor #D00F-9210-N. The engine dyno tested with 527 horsepower and 599 Ft-Lbs. of torque. The engine breathes through the factory manifolds and correct style reproduction dual exhaust system. The engine is coupled to original matching numbers 4-speed transmission with factory Hurst shifter. The power is transferred to the \u201cDrag Pak\u201d 3.91 Traction-Lok rear axle. The undercarriage is also highly detailed throughout with many correct parts. The floors were re-painted in the correct red oxide color. This car was recently serviced and detailed which is documented with an invoice that\u2019s included. From the MS CLASSIC CARS Collection.\n",

        "description": "A Ferrari that you can truly drive and enjoy, this 348 was owned and cared for by a true car fanatic. The car has undergone many services and upkeep during their ownership including, most recently, a timing belt service in October of 2023. Outside, the car is finished in the believed correctly coded Nero (Black) paint color, and shows nicely after a fresh polishing. The traditional 5 spoke wheels for the model are present, and all show in beautiful shape. These wheels are wrapped in Continental Extreme Contact Sport tires that show good tread depth and look ready for more miles. Up front, the pop up headlights move as they should, and the sensors for the radar detector system are tucked into the bumper nicely. Moving inside, the tan leather interior shows nicely with strong feeling bolsters on the seats, good condition carpet, and great looking black leather. All gauges appear to work as they should, windows roll up and down easily, and the five speed transmission feels smooth. Tucked inside the hidden compartment on the dash is the upgraded Sony head unit, with upgraded a/d/s speakers located behind the seats. In the front trunk area is an a/d/s analog and digital amplifier system as well for even better sound. Included with the car is a Ferrari spares / tool kit as well as shop manuals for the car. For a Ferrari that you can take home and drive, this 348ts is an excellent choice.\n\u00a0\nVIN:\u00a0 ZFFFG36A1L0087081\nMileage Shown at Listing:\u00a0 39,986\n\u00a0\nPlease contact us with any questions, for more information, or for a shipping quote.\n",

THANK YOU.\nhttps://bringatrailer.com/listing/1987-porsche-911-turbo-coupe-34/\nThis amazing and fully documented 1987 Porsche 911 Turbo with 31,000 original miles is a great example of a highly collectable European Sports Car. This car is a documented two owner vehicle with a clean Car Fax report. The 930 Turbo 3.3L was produced from 1978-1989 totaling 18,770 units worldwide. For the 1978 model year, Porsche revised the 930 with a larger 3.3-liter turbocharged engine with intercooler rated at 282hp. To fit the intercooler a newly designed \u201ctea-tray\u201d tail spoiler replaced the earlier whale tail spoiler. Porsche dropped the \u201cCarrera\u201d nomenclature for the North American markets and the car was simply called the Porsche 911 Turbo worldwide. The larger engine helped reduce some of the turbo lag inherent in the earlier models. As the original factory window sticker documents this example was ordered and shipped to Ogner Motorcars, Inc. located in Woodland Hills, CA. It was ordered with a Silver Metallic exterior and Black leather interior. It was also ordered with an electric sunroof and limited slip differential. As the original \u201cMotor Vehicle Purchase Order\u201d, original \u201cOdometer Statement\u201d and original \u201cDue Bill\u201d document it was purchased on July 7th, 1987 by Robert Faust who lived in Sherman Oaks, CA. A receipt of payment made in full was issued on July 20th, 1987. Robert was an excellent caretaker and always maintained the car properly which is documented with 16 service invoices from 1987-2007. Robert moved to New Mexico in July of 2006 which is indicated on the original New Mexico title. On March 2, 2007 Robert decided to sell the car with 26,081 original miles to Willhoit Enterprises which was a used automotive dealership located in Springfield, MO. This is also documented on the original New Mexico title. On March 20th, 2007 the car was sold to Michael Foley who lives in Bristol, RI which is documented with the original \u201cRetail Buyers Order\u201d. On April 22, 2007 Michael sent the car to Musante Motorsprorts located in South Windsor, CT for a complete service. Musante Motorsports is well-known and respected in the Porsche community. Musante Motorsports suggested an engine out service which is extensive. Some of the service also included some upgraded parts. As the service invoices document Michael invested a total of $30,291.75 in parts and labor which he didn\u2019t mind because he was going to keep the car along time. He had the car dyno tested and as the dyno sheet documents it put down 375hp at the rear tires! Michael was also an excellent caretaker and always maintained the car properly. During the next 16 years Michael only used the car on special occasions averaging roughly 300 miles per year. It was stored in his garage on a car lift and was covered with a battery tender. During his time of ownership he found the original owner Robert Faust\u2019s wallet under the seat. The wallet contained his license, 1 Admirals Club card, 3 credit cards, 2 California registrations and 3 insurance cards. Michael tried reaching out to Rober to return the wallet and learned Robert had passed. Michael kept the wallet and everything in it which is included. Michael is now retired and in his 70\u2019s. He and his wife are moving down south closer to family so he decided to sell the car. Michael contacted MS CLASSIC CARS about purchasing the vehicle before listing it for sale. MS CLASSIC CARS jumped on the opportunity and purchased the car in September of 2023.\n",

It was purchased on June 20th, 2000 by its last owner who lives in Barrington, RI. This gentleman treated the car to the best of care during his 23 years of ownership. It was primary used as an occasional driver and show car. The exterior appearance is simply stunning with its stylish design and beautiful color combination. The body is very straight with excellent gap lines throughout. It was re-finished its original factory correct color of Horizon Blue with Ermine White coves. The ocean deep paint was recently detailed to a brilliant shine. It was outfitted with a brand new white soft top that was stamped with April 1960 date. The front windshield and door glass is new with stamps. Everything on the exterior was restored or replaced such as the glass trim, driver\u2019s side mirror, fender trim and headlight bezels, front grill, front split bumpers, license plate frame, door handles, cove trim, antenna, rear tail light bezels and lenses, rear spilt bumpers and emblems throughout. It\u2019s equipped with quadruple T-3 headlights. The car sits perfectly on 15\u201d blue painted steel wheels with Spinner hub caps.

        "description": "The second generation Ford GT was conceptualized as both a testament to innovation and a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the original GT40's historic 1-2-3 victory at Le Mans in 1966. Ford intended not just to produce a supercar that paid homage to its predecessor but to eclipse it with cutting-edge technology and performance. The development began in secret, under the code name \"Project Phoenix,\" spearheaded by a small group of Ford engineers and designers committed to recapturing the glory of the GT's heritage. Their efforts came to light in 2015 when Ford stunned the automotive world with the unveiling of the all-new GT at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. With a design that was aerodynamically sculpted for maximum efficiency and a nod to the original GT40, the new GT was a striking blend of history and futuristic vision.\n\nProduction of the second generation Ford GT started in December 2016, with a plan for a limited run, making it an exclusive supercar emphasizing performance and collectibility. It was outfitted with a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 engine, which was a departure from the traditional V8. Yet, it delivered a formidable 647 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque, further increased to 660 horsepower starting in the 2020 model year. This powerhouse was encased in a carbon fiber monocoque chassis, draped in a sleek, aerodynamically optimized body that paid homage to its ancestors while breaking ground with its efficiency and downforce generation. Ford utilized the most advanced materials and engineering techniques of the time, ensuring that the second-generation GT set a new benchmark for American supercars in terms of performance, technology, and design. With its active aerodynamics, pushrod suspension, and a top speed of over 200 miles per hour, the GT was not just a tribute to the past; it was a bold stride into the future of automotive excellence.\n\nThe 2021 Ford GT offered here presents in immaculate, like-new condition, showing a mere 29 miles on the odometer. Nearly $50,000 worth of desirable options further enhance this example's appeal, including the Dark Energy interior upgrade package, a comprehensive cabin overhaul that adds boundless carbon fiber and alluring black finishes. The leather-wrapped F1-inspired steering wheel, Sparco carbon fiber racing seats trimmed with black Alcantara, matte carbon instrument bezels, and anodized black aluminum shift paddles complete the dark, jet-fighter interior. Outside, the car is finished in Frozen White with optional Lightning Blue stripes, a livery that evokes Ford's racing history in an immediately recognizable fashion. Matching blue-painted Brembo brake calipers are mounted over ventilated and cross-drilled carbon ceramic rotors, appearing as jewels under the 20\" satin silver wheels. On the road or the track, the speed-activated splitter and deployable rear wing keep downforce high, while the push-button front lift system makes day-to-day navigation simple. Offered here with special permission from Ford, this example represents a rare opportunity to own a virtually brand-new GT.\n\u00a0\nOptional Equipment\nModifications\nOwnership History & Provenance\nItems included in the Sale\n",

        "description": "The first generation Ford GT was born to celebrate Ford's centennial and simultaneously resurrect its legendary performance racing history. Conceived in 2002, the development of this iconic sports car was spearheaded by Ford's then-Vice President of Design, J Mays. The design took inspiration from the historic Ford GT40, the legendary race car that achieved an impressive four consecutive wins at Le Mans from 1966 to 1969, defying Ferrari's dominance. The team aimed not just to echo the GT40's aesthetic appeal but to craft a modern supercar that could stir the souls of car enthusiasts and honor the original's legacy. By mid-2003, a concept version had been unveiled, stunning the public with its faithful yet fresh reinterpretation of the GT40's timeless design.\n\nManufacture of the first generation Ford GT commenced in 2004, with the first deliveries taking place the same year. The car was engineered to be a high-performance machine and a road-legal sports car, a dual character that required an exquisite balance of power, handling, and aerodynamics. It featured a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 engine, which produced an impressive 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Crafted with an aluminum body and equipped with a sophisticated suspension system, the GT was a showcase of Ford's advanced technology and commitment to driving excellence. Its production, however, was limited; over two years, only around 4,000 units were built, making it an instant classic. The GT's blend of performance and exclusivity solidified its place in the pantheon of great American sports cars.\n\nThe 2006 Ford GT offered here shows just over 3,700 miles on the clock and has remained with one owner since new; its exceptional condition is a testament to the owner's meticulous care. It is finished in Centennial White with optional blue racing stripes over an Ebony leather interior, perhaps the most iconic and well-known GT combination. Outside, the optional lightweight forged aluminum wheels are complemented by gray-painted brake calipers mounted over the massive ventilated and cross-drilled rotors. Inside the sleek, rocket ship interior, bolstered sport seats trimmed in Ebony leather ensure the occupants stay firmly put even at breakneck speeds while the optional McIntosh sound system provides entertainment. Rarely does a first-generation example of this caliber present itself, and this example checks every box for the discerning collector.\n\u00a0\nOptional Equipment:\nService Records\nOwnership History & Provenance\nItems included in the Sale\n",

        "year": "1962",
        "description": "From the beginning in 1940 the Lincoln Continental was always a high quality and very good looking sporty car originally designed by Edsel Ford\u2019s own personal use. It was so good looking that all of his friends wanted one which pushed him to move it into production. Fast-forwarding to 1958,\u00a0Lincoln made a bold move in switching to unitary construction for the 1958 models, but the result was somewhat underwhelming. The largest Lincolns to date and the hugest unibody cars ever, they came across as massive and interesting, competitive at first but pretty dated by 1960. The new, clean design for 1961 started out as a Thunderbird concept and so it was\u00a0created around a Thunderbird cowl. But it was Robert McNamara, Ford general manager and future company president, who suggested it become a four-door Lincoln Continental. This caused quite a stir, since an evolutionary Lincoln, based on the 1958-60 design, was already in process. But Engel's design prevailed, and went into production in November 1960.\nThe Industrial Design Institute awarded it a coveted Bronze Medal which is very difficult to achieve for an automobile. 15 inches shorter than its predecessor, the new Continental was designed for ease of passenger entry: the lack of a wrap-around windshield and use of\u00a0 \"suicide\" rear doors aided in this. And truly modern for the time was a four-door convertible body style.\nOffered here\n",

        "year": "1966",
        "description": "The Austin Healey is one of the most iconic British Sports cars ever built and one of the most beautiful at that. Beginning production in 1953 with the iconic 100-4, Austin Healeys 4 cylinder model which proved to be extremely popular for both road\u00a0and racing purposes. After a while Donald Healey just couldn't\u00a0squeeze any more power out of his trusty Austin 4 cylinder so he upgraded to a straight six cylinder overhead valve Austin unit with twin SU H6 carburetors producing 130 horsepower, a huge upgrade from the previous 4 cylinder engine. The 100-6 proved to be extremely popular becoming the basis for the iconic 3000 to follow. The 3000 proved to be even more popular and much more refined than its predecessors. The overhead valve six was upgraded yet again now 3 liters versus the 2.6 liter engine in the 100-6. he most refined version and arguably the best came in 1965 with the BJ8 MKIII. These had 150 horsepower over the previous 136 horsepower in the MKII with a bore size of 2 inches and a higher lift camshaft. These also had a wood grained dash board, a 4 speed transmission with overdrive and roll up windows. These were the best road going Healeys.\nOffered here is one of these great BJ8 MKIII\u2019s that is a very solid original car that is well sorted and is rust free. Finished in red with black coves, this late 3000 is really sharp. Everything works as it should including the overdrive. It has recently been treated to a mechanical service with a new clutch, throwout bearing and rear main seal. It runs and drives incredibly well and is fitted with aa stainless steel exhaust that gives an incredible tone. If you are looking for a great, well sorted BJ8 MKIII than this car should certainly be considered.\n",

The car is painted in the factory color code S (Medium Gold Metallic), and the interior has been changed from the original Nugget-colored interior to a cloth animal print. This Continental comes with power seats, locks, windows, and the trademark suicide rear-hinged doors. The car's odometer shows 39,260 miles, but the total mileage is unknown. This Lincoln is currently located in Chicago, Illinois.\nThe third-party photos of the car show a straight body with clean lines. The car does show some rust on the lower left rear quarter panel and front bumper, and surface rust is present underneath the vehicle. There is also a paint defect on the right fender, and the photos show a cracked fan shroud. A third-party inspection of the car was performed and found that the interior is in good condition despite a tear in the headliner. The inspection also notes that the tire tread depth should also be monitored. All power features in the interior are said to be functioning properly. A video of the engine running smoothly is included in the report. Overall the car is a good candidate for some exterior reconditioning or for the next owner to enjoy as it is. Included in the sale are two sets of keys.\u00a0\nThis Lincoln Continental is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Chicago, IL.\nFinancing options are available through our recommended lenders. Please find options here.\n\u00a0\nAbout the model\nThe fourth generation Lincoln Continental was introduced for the 1961 model year. The fourth-generation Continental is one of Lincoln's most well-known cars, featuring prominently in pop culture. Lincoln consolidated their model lineup in 1961, making the Continental their only model. The fourth-generation Continentals were available as sedans, coupes, or four-door convertibles and were fitted with a range of V8 engines. Production of the fourth-generation Continental lasted until 1969 when it was replaced by the Fifth Generation Lincoln Continental.\nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n",

You can rest assured that this collectible icon will inspire your love of collectible classics for many years to come!\n\u00a0\nThe Ford Galaxie is a full-sized car that was built in the United States by Ford for model years 1959 through to 1974. The name was used for the top models in Ford's full-size range from 1958 until 1961, in a marketing attempt to appeal to the excitement surrounding the Space Race. In 1958, a concept car was introduced called \"la Galaxie\" which incorporated the headlights into pods in line with the grille and a reduced front profile. The 1963 model was essentially unchanged save for some freshening and added trim; windshields were reshaped, and a four-door hardtop 500/XL was added. A lower, fastback roofline was added mid-year to improve looks and make the big cars more competitive on the NASCAR tracks with less drag and reduced aerodynamic lift at high speed. Very few of these automobile icons are still on the road. Fewer still are the number of road-worthy units in such fantastic condition as this one! This 1963 Ford Galaxie Fastback comes with a plethora of options and features that are perfect for any true classic car enthusiast.\n\u00a0\nHighlights Include:\n\u00a0\nAll Original\n52,000 Miles\u00a0\nWith One Repaint\n\u00a04-Barrell Aluminum Intake\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd So Much More!!\n\u00a0\nThis 1963 Ford Galaxie Fastback has been very well maintained and adult driven.

This original example is painted red with chrome trim and matching red painted steel wheels that make this Monza one of the sportiest Corvairs available at the time. Inside, the front bucket seats and rear bench are covered in red vinyl with matching carpet, dashboard, and door trim. Dashboard-mounted controls are fronted by a two-spoke red leather-wrapped steering wheel. The 5-digit odometer shows 35,336 original miles. The vehicle is located in Wisconsin.\nThird-party photos and inspection show a well-kept, original Monza. The paint is in good condition overall and only close inspection reveals some wear and tear that would be expected given the age of the vehicle. There is a scratch noted on the right rear quarter panel. Inside, the carpet and vinyl seats are presented in excellent condition.\u00a0 Similarly, the white headliner shows well and is free of stains. The inspection and owner confirm that mechanically, the engine and transmission run smoothly as designed.

The\u00a0first generation of Corvair\u00a0was a series of compact, rear-engined cars available in sedan, coupe, convertible, and station wagon body styles. These cars were initially powered by an air-cooled, 2.3L flat-six engine, but over the course of production, displacement grew to 2.4L (1961-1963), before finally reaching 2.7L for the 1964 model year. In 1961, Chevrolet introduced a van and pickup based on the Corvair. These utilitarian vans and pickups are collectively known as the Corvair 95 (95-inch wheelbase), with the van known as the Chevrolet Greenbrier, and the pickup featuring in the Corvair Pickup market. Production of the first-generation Corvair continued until 1964 when it was replaced by the Second Generation Chevrolet Corvair.\n\u00a0\nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nOwnership History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n",

        "description": "The Fiat 500 was a revolutionary vehicle that made way for the compact car as we know it today. It was considered one of the first purpose-built city vehicles and provided an unbeatable economical package for those living in bustling metropolises. At 9'9\" long, there were few places one could not drive, or park, a Fiat 500. The diminutive sedan weighed just 1,100 lbs and was powered by a 479cc, 2-cylinder, air-cooled engine producing 13 horsepower (with later models increasing output to 17 horsepower). The 500 was an instant success and would see few updates throughout its nearly 20-year production run, over which time almost 4 million vehicles were sold. Today, the Fiat 500 is an instantly recognizable and well-loved piece of automotive history with cultural significance that cannot be overstated.\nThis 1968 Fiat 500F is finished in a stylish blue over a black vinyl interior that perfectly suits the car's classic, fashion-forward shape. It is equipped with a factory fabric sunroof and an original-style black Italian license plate. The 2-cylinder engine performs well and scoots the 500 through traffic with ease. The 5-digit odometer reads 13,812 miles, which is believed to be accurate. This Fiat 500 is a joy to drive and turns heads everywhere it goes. It is a fantastic weekend runabout and is ready to be enjoyed by its next owner.\n",

        "description": "1976 Altfater Sprint Car.\nPreviously from the Ray Evernham Collection\nRay Evernham purchased this car for its quintessential representation of the Sprint Car design ethos of the 1970s, with the era later introducing wings with side boards attached to the top of the roll cage. Believed to be the chassis creation of Charlie Altfater, little of this car\u2019s early history is known. What can be ascertained is that this car was campaigned in period by driver Glenn D. Feuerstein of Seven Hills, Ohio. The official records show that it raced only twice with a finishing place of 18th at the 1978 30th annual Payless Super Markets Little 500 and a 23rd place finish at the 1980 32nd annual Payless Super Markets Little 500.\nWhat drew Ray Evernham to this car was its iconic \u201cin-period\u201d shape and setup that included a Stu Hillborn fuel-injected V-8 engine with magneto ignition and Brodix free-flow racing cylinder heads. The stance is typical dirt track with its staggered and offset wheel and tire combination featuring large M&H tires in the rear and grooved Goodyear front tires mounted on Halibrand magnesium wheels with tri-prong knock-offs.\nDuring this era of racing, the short, oval, dirt tracks were the stepping stone for a professional ride at the large, oval, speedway tracks like the prestigious Indianapolis Raceway. All of the greatest drivers of the Indianapolis Brickyard\u2014including A.J. Foyt, Al Unser, Bobby Unser, Wally Dallenbach, Mario Andretti, Lloyd Rudy, Pancho Carter, Johnny Rutherford and more\u2014\u201ccut their teeth\u201d and \u201cmade their bones\u201d driving sprint cars in the short bullrings of Eldora, El Centro, Redding and Indianapolis Park. What made these sprint cars such lethal weapons was their immense horsepower relative to their light weight, all of which was contained within in a very short wheelbase. Driving an open-wheeled Sprint car sideways in close contact with one another separated the men from the boys in this form of racing.\nEngine last ran on Dyno in 2012 and was put in proper storage. Engine is fresh/ 0 hours ready to run.\nWorldwide shipping available, please email me for a Quote.\n",

Stock inline six-cylinder motor mated with a stock three speed transmission and stock four-wheel drive transfer case. The motor has been fully rebuilt, all new gaskets throughout, carburetor rebuilt to Toyota specs, all engine components were either reconditioned or replaced as needed. New Toyota disc brakes and stock suspension has been fully upgraded with Old Man Emu suspension. All new Toyota hardware was used for reassembly. Throughout the restoration new OEM parts were used when possible, when something was unavailable new, the original part off the vehicle was restored back to the original fit and finish. PPG paint was used to refinish the factory color and a PPG concept acrylic urethane to achieve the original paint sheen. The Factory Canvas Top was replicated to same specs and color as the original. The entire interior has been dismantled, cleaned, inspected, restored or replaced. Don\u2019t miss out on this opportunity to own a piece of Land Cruiser history! This is an exceptional vehicle with nothing overlooked in the factory restoration.\u00a0\n",

This Goodwood green coupe boasts an older restoration build, faithfully recreating the iconic 427/435HP configuration (tribute) with a Tri-Power setup and a 4-speed transmission. From its nicely cared for factory interior to its captivating exterior, this Corvette exudes timeless beauty and offers an exhilarating driving experience.\nThis documented 1967 Corvette comes in its original Goodwood green shade, accentuated by striking white stinger stripes - a combination that epitomizes the allure of mid-year Corvettes. During a previous restoration, the car was partially disassembled and rebuilt, transforming it into a remarkable 427/435 tribute. Notably, it features a date code correct 427/435 HP engine, ensuring authenticity and performance.\nStep inside, and you'll be greeted by a beautifully restored green interior. The upholstery exudes luxury and comfort, complemented by brand new carpets and restored gauges, which appear crisp and vibrant behind crystal-clear lenses. Impressively, even the clock is in perfect working order. The monochromatic ambiance is enhanced by a real wood-rimmed steering wheel, while the chrome 4-speed shifter adds a touch of coolness. And yes, the AM/FM radio effortlessly tunes in to your favorite stations. Remarkably, the odometer shows only 69,586 believed-to-be original miles.\nPowering this remarkable Corvette is a freshly rebuilt 427/435 engine, featuring the signature Tri-Power setup concealed under the distinctive triangular air cleaner. With a robust cam inside, the engine emits an authoritative rumble and delivers exhilarating performance. The engine bay showcases proper detailing, though the paint exhibits signs of aging, giving the car a character that encourages occasional drives to let its 435 horses stretch their legs. Recent servicing of the 4-speed transmission and rear end, along with power brakes, ensures an effortless and enjoyable driving experience. Completing the package are the factory-style wheels, adding an extra touch of authenticity.\nTo underscore the car's pedigree and condition, it was personally inspected by renowned Corvette expert Roy Sinor in January of this year (report available upon request). With every aspect nicely sorted and attended to, this Corvette is ready to hit the road and be enjoyed to the fullest. Its mere presence commands respect, and its performance never fails to impress.\nWhile a factory-original, matching-numbers 427/435 Corvette commands a substantial premium in today's market, this custom crafted tribute car presents a unique opportunity. Priced at a fraction of its counterpart, it offers the chance to own a remarkable piece of automotive history without compromising on performance or driving pleasure.\nDon't miss your chance to own this exceptional 1967 Chevrolet Corvette 427/435 tribute car. Embrace the joy of driving and make a statement wherever you go.\n",

And the Bugeye (Frogeye in Britain) was very poplar because it had unique styling, exciting performance, and reliability (first three places in its class in the 1959 12-hour race at Sebring).\u00a0 It is, in short, \u00a0a true British sports car restored to an \u201cas new\u201d level.\nFor more information call us at 540-370-4474\n",

Built at the San Jose plant, and purchased originally by a lady in Corvallis, Oregon, at Wilson Ford. She obviously kept the Mustang in the garage the whole time she owned it, and compulsively maintained it until she sold it to it's next owner that picked up the baton and continued to obsessively maintain the car, and synthetically restore the Mustang as needed.\n",

        "description": "The key words to describe this Tiger are UNIQUE and ACCURATE.\n\u200d\nWhy UNIQUE:\n\u200d\nWhy ACCURATE:\n\u200d\nHistory of the Tiger:\nThe ownership and location history of #375 has been derived from conversation with the son of the second\nowner, and the third owner. Both provided oral information and documentation. I was also able to contact\nTony Borroz, the son of owner number two, who provided additional insight into his father\u2019s period of\nownership. The ownership time period of owner one and two may not be split exactly correctly, but is\nbelieved to be pretty close.\n\u200d\nThe Anecdotal Story goes like this: \n\u200d\n\u200d\ncar or modify it in any way. I was unable to document his name.\n\u200d\nThe second owner Joe Borroz, moved to Vancouver, Washington in 1950 where he worked 30 years for Alcoa\nAluminum as a tool and die maker. Joe was in his late 40\u2019s when he bought the car from owner number one.\nAccording to Joe\u2019s son Tony, Joe did not believe the car should be modified, but rather maintained as stock.\nJoe regarded himself as the \u201cCaretaker\u201d of the Tiger, rather than the \u201cOwner\u201d. In 1995 Joe moved to Sierra\nVista, Arizona, taking the car with him. Again, a very mature second owner that also was not a hot rodder or\nauto-crosser.\n\u200d\nThe car was always a Sunday car, never a daily driver, which kept the mileage down. To this day the car only\nhas 95,000 miles, which is very low for a 60 year old car. It rains a lot in Oregon and Washington, which also\nprobably helped keep the mileage low.\n\u200d\nFourteen years later in August 2009 Jeff Kane bought the car and relocated it to the Bay Area. The car was\nvery complete and unmolested, retaining all the normal Tiger pieces that typically have been lost and\nreplaced. That\u2019s why Jeff bought the car, as you rarely see unmolested Tigers. Because of its age and unusually\nlow mileage, Jeff commissioned Rootes Group Depot to totally restore and freshen the car. The suspension,\nbrakes, interior and under carriage were redone. The engine was not rebuilt but carb, generator, distributor\nand radiator were redone. It is very likely that a valve job was performed.\n\u200d\nJeff had another Personalized Tiger that he drove primarily, leaving #375 to sit more than is good for them.\nWhen Jeff passed away, I bought the car from Emily Vassos, his wife.\n\u00a0\nThe Freshen Up:\n\u200d\nSince the car was in the Bay Area, as is Rootes Group, I asked Bill Martin what it would take to make the car\nexceptionally concours correct. At the time, Bill and other STOA members were using this car to write the\nconcours correct judging manual. Bill and I spent an entire afternoon going over the car with a microscope.\nWe filled 5 pages of a spiral bound notebook with small and not so small corrections to freshen and make\ncorrections. Bill spent 6 months blowing thru the list. The totality of the result was stunning. It was as if the car\nwas completely re-restored. After taking possession of the car, I did another 2 pages of \u201cfixes\u201d.\n\u200d\nThe First Showings:\n\u200d\nThe car was not finished when we took it to Tigers United 40 in 2019 held in Sacramento. CA. Unbelievably,\nthe car took first place in Stock Concour, and also won the Howie Award for Best Stock Tiger, and then won\nthe Peoples Choice Award.\n\u200d\nDue to Covid, the next possible outing was Suni VII, held in Indepence, MO in September 2021.\nThe Tiger easily placed First in the Stock Tiger class in the Concour Judging.\nRecently, the Tiger was shown at Tigers United 41 in Santa Maria, CA in June 2022. The Tiger won Stock\nConcour and for the second time won the prestigious Howie Award for best stock Tiger.\n\u200d\nWhy LUCKY:\n\u200d\nSo, to Unique and Accurate we have to add LUCKY. LUCKY, that the first two long term owners were very\nmature. LUCKY they were not hot rodders or auto-crossers. Lucky that they lived and cared for the car far\naway from the California scene, that destroyed so many cars. LUCKY, the car spent its whole life in favorable\nclimates. LUCKY, that in the car\u2019s 60 year life, it has covered only 95,000 original miles.\n\u00a0\nThe car runs and drives like a new Tiger with very tight suspension and steering. This Tiger runs exceptionally\ncool at both high and low speeds, and even stop and go. There are no oil leaks of any kind. Absolutely\neverything works properly, as noted in the Functions test at the two events attended.\n\u00a0\nREFERENCES:\n\u200d\nAnyone interested in purchasing this car should very definitely discuss it with Bill Martin, who\nbuilt the car, and more importantly was and is, the Chief Arbiter of Correctness. The following Tiger Notables\nTom Hall and Patrick King are completely familiar and knowledgeable about this car and could be used as\nreferences. Of course, the car has been TAC\u2019d and authenticated.\n\u00a0\nPotential Spares:\n\u200d\nPotentially available spares not included in the purchase price are the following:\n",

        "brand": "Porsche",
        "model": "911T",
        "year": "1971",
        "description": "- Chassis # 9111110750\n\u00a0\nThe 911 was the model that officially put the Porsche name in front of the world. Both on the street and on the track, it was and continues to be one of the most popular luxury sports cars on the market. The air-cooled 911, produced from 1964 to 1998, went through a number of engines and styles before a full redesign came with the 996 series.\n\u00a0\nThe 1970 and 1971 Porsche 911s were fitted with a larger, 2.2 L engine rather than the previous generation\u2019s 2.0 L engine that could be mated to either a four-speed 911/00 manual transmission or a five-speed 911/01 manual transmission. The displacement increase brought horsepower figures to 123 hp in the 911T, 153 hp in the 911E, and 180 hp in the top-of-the-line 911S. The T joined its brethren in receiving ventilated disc brakes, making all 911s so equipped. This generation of 911 saw safer external door handles, rubber-mounted dashboard gauges, a steering lock, as well as a US-only warning buzzer to let the driver know the keys were left in the ignition.\n\u00a0\nFor the 1971 model year, only the 911E & S had fuel injection, while the entry-level 911T came standard with Zenith carburetors. This changed in 1972 when fuel injection became standard across all models due to US emissions regulations. All 1971 models did, however, come equipped with three-speed intermittent windshield wipers and crankcase oil squirters for improved piston cooling.\n\u00a0\nThis generation continued offering the \u201cTarga\u201d version, which gave the car a \u201csafer\u201d open-air experience to appease the U.S. NHTSA regulations. Rather than a fully open-top convertible, the Targa was equipped with a stainless steel-clad roll bar, a removable roof panel, and a removable plastic rear window.\n\u00a0\nThe collectability and value of Porsche 911s, in general, has been steadily increasing over the past decade or so. Even though the T was the starter 911 for this generation, the US-market cars can be more desirable than their international counterparts due to the slight increase in horsepower. The Targa versions are also the best of both worlds between a coupe and a convertible, offering both experiences without much compromise.\n\u00a0\nThis particular example, Chassis # 9111110750, is a 1971 model fitted with the five-speed 911/01 manual transmission. According to the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, it was ordered with optional front and rear stabilizers, comfort equipment, tinted glass, Targa top, and light metal wheels. It was finished in a fairly unique warm shade of yellow that not many cars at the time wore called Gold Metallic. The interior was finished in contrasting Black Leatherette, a color scheme it wears to this day. Not much is known about this 911T\u2019s history other than the fact that it is a numbers-matching example with a good, driver-quality restoration. The stock Zenith carburetors were also upgraded to Webers, giving the car an upgraded and more reliable driving experience.\n\u00a0\nWhen we received it on consignment in June of 2022, we had some servicing performed to get the car in proper running order. Autocar Bespoke, LLC in Philadelphia, PA, started things off with an exterior and brightwork detail before we entrusted Performance Automotive Inc. in Malvern, PA, in September of 2022 with a clutch service that included a clutch cable, clevis pin, and pivot pin. It returned to Performance Automotive Inc. in August of 2023 for a full transmission rebuild that included a clutch pedal shaft, synchro sleeve, synchro rings and teeth, gear teeth, differential bearings, and fresh fluids. They also addressed some fuel system issues that were rectified with a new fuel pressure regulator and a carburetor rebuild.\n\u00a0\nAs it sits, this 1971 Porsche 911T is a numbers-matching, driver-level restored example that is ready for a new adventure. The optional Targa top makes this a perfect choice for any weather while adding a style choice that revolutionized the industry when it was released. Those looking for a classic, entry-level 911 to add to their collection or to kickstart their Porsche lineup would be pleased with what this one has to offer. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the service records on file, the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, and the original spare wheel.\n\u00a0\nPlease visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

I sold it around 35 years ago to a friend and it was a 100% rust free car even before being restored.\nThe then owner wanted a clean look up front so the headlights were mounted behind the corner chrome louvers and a 1965 Riviera grill installed. It looks like a 1965 Riviera\u00a0except the chrome louvers don't open.\nA new piston broke in the rebuilt 401 Nailhead\u00a0after 500 miles and the engine was damaged\u00a0and the Buick went into long time storage. I recently bought a 425 Nailhead from a 1965 Riviera that has been totally, completely rebuilt. Bored with new pistons and rings, crank turned, new cam, lifters, timing gears and chain, oil pump, redone heads with hardened valve seats etc. It was a $5000 plus rebuild.\nThe body of the Riviera is fantastic, never any rust. Mechanically it has been redone and rebuilt, the chrome is a mixture of rechrome and excellent original chrome. The interior was totally redone and it is fantastic also.\nNew tires, in my pictures the car has incorrect wide white wall tires, they have since been\u00a0 replaced with skinnier white wall tires.\nNew exhaust, new alternator, new master cylinder and the complete brake system\u00a0has been rebuilt, rebuilt carburetor, new water pump, new fuel pump, recored original radiator and on and on. The restoration cost around $65.000 and that was around 15 years ago .\nI don't think there's another restored 1964 Riviera in this condition for sale at even close to my inexpensive price!\u00a0\nThe Riviera is in Phoenix, Arizona. I\u00a0ship worldwide since 1986.\n[email\u00a0protected]\n602/931-6000\n\u00a0\n",

        "model": "968",
        "year": "1993",
        "description": "- Chassis # WPOZZZ962PS815259\nWhen Porsche released the 968 in 1991, it was the last of a few things, including the last new front-engined Porsche until the Cayenne arrived in 2003 and the last of a series of water-cooled front-engine rear-wheel drive models that began in 1976 with the 924 and later the 944. While the 968 was supposed to be yet another revised model of the 944, dubbed the S3, Porsche decided it would be best to make it its own model thanks to the significant changes the engineers had made to the chassis.\nTo appease those with a love for speed, Porsche released a lightweight version of the 968 dubbed the \u201cClubsport\u201d from October 1992 to 1995. Many of the luxury features of the 968 were removed or made an option in pursuit of sheer performance. The car had less sound deadening, manual windows, manually adjustable lightweight Recaro racing seats a revised and lowered suspension system, wider 17-inch wheels, a thicker, three-spoke sports steering wheel with no airbag, non-heated washer jets, no engine bay vanity covers, no rear wiper, no rear seats, and a smaller battery. 1993 Clubsport models were only available in Grand Prix White, Black, Speed Yellow, Guards Red, or Maritime Blue with matching seat backs. Clubsport decals were standard in either black, red, or white, but they could also be deleted if wanted.\nThe 968 CS used the same 3.0 L M44 I4 engine from the regular 968 backed by either a 6-speed manual, which this one is equipped with, or 4-speed Tiptronic automatic. The Clubsport weighed 2,910 lb (1,320 kg), or around 220 lb (~100 kg) lighter than the regular 968, which gave it a 5.6 second 0-60 mph time and a top speed of 162 mph (260 km/h).\nClubsport models were only available in the UK, Europe, Japan, and Australia, and a total of 1232 were produced over three years.\nThis particular example, Chassis # WPOZZZ962PS815259, was first registered in August 1993 in the Netherlands. It was painted in Speed Yellow over a Black/Speed Yellow Leatherette & Cloth interior, the same color scheme it wears today. Options included Equipment for France, a higher amperage battery, the rare limited-slip differential, air conditioning, and the anti-theft package, according to the Porsche Production Specifications document. It was very well maintained throughout the years, with a plethora of service records attesting to this.\nSome significant service records to note are new adjustable Koni shocks from V.D. Gugten in Bodegraven, Netherlands, in March of 2013 and new timing belts from RS Motors Porsche Centre West-Vlaanderen in Ingelmunster, Belgium, on July 5th of 2018.\nAround 2018, the car was imported into New Hampshire, where it was enjoyed until we acquired it sometime in June of 2023. We entrusted Mark Cavanaugh in Beverly, NJ, with performing the few services this 968 CS needed to be as perfect as it could be. Items included new door handle gaskets, windshield wipers, lower plastics, thermostat & seals, wheelhouse liners, power steering reservoir & hose, along with a few hose clamps, minor touchups, and repairs.\nIf a track car is what you\u2019re after, you cannot go wrong with a Porsche 968 CS, especially one with the LSD option like this one. The difference in handling will absolutely be clear over one without the LSD, and the impact of the 220 lb loss over the regular 968 is hard to overstate. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the original owner\u2019s manual, tool kit, factory brochures, German paperwork, the service records on file, and an extra set of keys.\n\u00a0Please visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

It is equipped with an built LS2 making 530 horsepower, 6 speed manual transmission, 4 wheel wilwood disc brakes with drilled and slotted rotors, A/C, pioneer sound system, custom leather interior, staggered aluminum wheels, 12 bolt rear end, and a custom blue metallic paint job that draws a ton of attention. The car will drive high speeds like a brand new car and performs flawlessly. The car was rotisserie restored and would easily cost over $200,000 to replicate. I have an appraisal showing the current market value to be $165,000. This car needs nothing and is ready for a new home.

        "model": "Elise",
        "year": "2005",
        "description": "- Chassis # SCCPC11195HL31931\n\u00a0\nWhen Lotus debuted the Elise in 1996, the revolutionary fiberglass body shell and extruded aluminum chassis made it an ideal British sports car with rigid suspension, low cost, and weight. The Series 1 Elise was produced from 1996 to 2001, with the Series 2 coming along later that year to meet new European crash regulations.\u00a0\nThe Series 2 was produced until 2011 and featured a new Lotus-developed ECU and was the first car produced by the British marque to be designed on a computer. The Elise delivered stateside was powered by a Toyota 2ZZ-GE 1.8 L I4 tuned by Lotus to 190 hp and backed by a Toyota C64 6-speed manual transmission. Figures from the test showed a 0\u201360 mph time of approximately 4.9 seconds.\nThe small size, great handling, and relatively budget-friendly price of the Elise made it a popular choice for drivers who wanted both a track-friendly car that was equally as usable in the city. Despite its price, all three generations had exotic car-like looks that set it apart from other sports cars on the market at the time. According to a\u00a0post on the Lotus Talk forums, certificates provided by Lotus historian Andy Graham point to 3,323 examples of the Lotus Elise being produced in 2005, 202 of those being in Racing Green Metallic.\nThis particular example, Chassis # SCCPC11195HL31931, was brought into the port of Charleston, SC from the UK in February of 2005 in Racing Green Metallic over a *** interior. It was delivered to Manhattan Motor Cars in New York, NY in May of that year and was used as one of two demonstrator cars at the dealership. The manual windows point to this Elise being a very early car as subsequent cars had electric windows.\u00a0\nThe first owner purchased the car in November 2006 with 900 miles on the odometer. The car was upgraded to 2006-spec through dealer-fitted, factory-supplied parts, including the rear wing, the rear Lotus badge, LED tail lamps with European amber turn lenses, and the supercharger. In August of 2007, the selling dealer performed the first service record on file, a 7,500-mile service despite the odometer reading less than 2,000 miles, and serviced the blower motor as well.\nIn 2012, the owner had a number of factory upgrades installed in recognition of the newly announced Jim Clark Type 25 Elise. They had a Type 25 interior fitted by the Lotus dealer on Long Island, which included the Type 25 wooden gear knob, rear window cap, hard top, and yellow highlights on the rear wing painted by Chuck Reiser in 2005 Lotus yellow. The owner also had the correct black Type 25 wheels fitted that currently wear brand-new Yokohama Advan tires. The original Blaupunkt radio was also changed for a similar Blaupunkt model with Bluetooth capability. Any and all of the parts that were swapped out during this transformation were kept and are included in the sale of the car.\u00a0\nThe Elise continued to be serviced at Manhattan Motor Cars and the Lotus dealer on Long Island until 2015, when it began being kept in highly professional storage in upstate New York. As it sits, this is a well-maintained, one-owner Lotus Elise with less than 5,000 miles on the odometer and unique Type 25 factory upgrades to help it stand out from the rest at your local British-only car show. Those looking to partake in the car that gave Lotus its modern reputation for lightweight, driver-focused cars would fall in love with what this Elise offers, especially with the Type 25 supercharger under the hood.\nUpon purchase, the new owner will receive the original owner\u2019s literature, purchase documents, window sticker, and service records on file. The car also comes with its original rims bearing an unused set of correct Bridgestone tires, the original Blaupunkt radio, the original unpainted engine covers, soft-top, hard-top, original seats, all the original pieces that were replaced for the 2006 spec update, door cards, lotus branded car cover, original steering wheel, and more.\u00a0\n",

        "description": "In the post war years Studebaker really upped their game in both design and performance. Especially towards the end of the 1950\u2019s and into the early 1960s, Studebaker had design face lifts from Brooks Stevens and really began to get into the performance game. The Avanti was ahead of its time in design and the Studebaker 289 V8 was a great engine. They offered a variety of models and configurations, but the best and rarest was the addition of the R2 package in any of the models offered by Studebaker; Lark, Hawk and Avanti. The R2 package boosted horsepower with the addition of a huge Mcculloch belt driven supercharger placed on top of the Studebaker 289. The R2\u2019s are awesome and could also be had with the optional Hallibrand wheels. The R2 cars were competitive race cars in stock form right from the factory and are an extremely rare sighting today especially a very late\u00a0Super Hawk which was the most refined and most powerful R2 Hawk produced. Only a handful of original Super Hawks exist today.\u00a0\nOffered here is an incredibly well preserved 1964 Studebaker Gran Tourismo Hawk with the rare R2 package and just 44,000 original miles from new. It still retains most of its original black paint, original red upholstery and it runs and drives well. The supercharged 289 is in proper running order and the transmission automatic transmission shifts as it should. Its equipped with power steering and power brakes making it very easy to drive. To really bring this R2 Hawk over the top, it is equipped with its original set of Studebaker Halibrand wheels which is a very are option for the R2 cars. If you are looking for an R2 Hawk, this low mileage Hawk is an incredible time capsule and such a neat example. Contact us today for more information.\n",

        "model": "Z3",
        "year": "1978",
        "description": "- VIN # WBSCK9333XLC89705\n\u00a0\nThe reintroduced popularity of the roadster body style brought about by the Mazda Miata in North America necessitated a reaction from the European Makes to offer their own interpretation on the genre after helping establish a market in the mid-century.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBMW entered into the fray in 1995 with the Z3. In classic roadster fashion, a long hood and short rear deck composed the overall shape. However, the lines were far from the typical teutonic straightedges commonly seen in the period, and instead, designer Joji Nagashima employed the softer, rounder shapes from the roadsters of the past. Every single body panel possesses some form of curvature, an element that surely gave the manufacturing side of the business a bit of a headache. Fortunately, it all works quite well, and today, the Z3 looks like nothing BMW has put out before or since, and the boldness of the design has aged remarkably well.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEnthusiasts of the brand might have been saddened to see an inline-6 unavailable at launch under that long hood, but all could rest assured that BMW would deliver soon enough. Many could be satisfied with the lightness and responsiveness of the 4-cylinder models, but more power always tends to make things better. Just a year after the car\u2019s introduction, the traditional Inline-6 arrived along with deliciously punched out fenders allowing for a 2.5inch wider rear track. It was only a matter of time now before the M-division got its hands on the little roadster.\n\u00a0\nFalling in line with E36 M3, North American examples of the new Z3 M Roadster were fitted with the S52 engine upon release. While down on power from its more exotic, individual throttle-bodied cousin, this bored and stroked M52 motor is not without its merits in the context of the contemporary automotive scene. At the end of the day, a naturally aspirated inline-6 with a 7,000rpm redline makes for an enticing proposition to any gearhead.\n\u00a0\nThe Z3 M Roadster on offer here, chassis # WBSCK9333XLC89705, is a 1-owner example finished in Estoril Blue over a full black interior. Showing just 24,266 miles this is one of the most well cared for examples we have handled. Delivered new to Roadshow BMW in Tennessee, the car was immediately sent to its one and only owner in Decatur, Illinois. From here the owner began thoroughly enjoying the Z3 as he put roughly 6,000 miles on the car in its first two summers. Over the next 6 years usage became less frequent but still regular with proper maintenance carried out along the way. As it sits today this Z3 is entirely unmodified and ready for continued use after a baseline fluids swap as the last service was done in late 2020, or roughly 1,000 miles ago. This Z3 M Roadster presents a great opportunity to acquire a collector grade example of the platform. With a handwritten log documenting every service and the miles corresponding to them you know exactly how meticulously maintained the car really is.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIncluded in the sale are the tools, first aid kit, black leather tonneau cover, the Z3 Roadster branded tonneau carrier case, and available service records and logs.\n\u00a0\nPlease visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

        "description": "As you know, the original Datsun 240Z is one of the most sought-after collectible cars in the entry to mid-level market.\nThis particular example was purchased through an estate broker with very low miles on the odometer. This car can be driven as is or\u00a0become an excellent\u00a0candidate for full restoration to a show standard. It currently runs but is in need of tuning. The paint is an older inexpensive re-spray in what appears to be the original color. As shown in the photos, there is\u00a0a solid foundation to work with. The undercarriage is very clean for a 50-year-old car. There are signs of previous rust repair on certain body panels, which is to be expected. Frankly, if addressed by Roadster Salon, we would recommend stripping the entire car to bare metal and addressing any prior body work before moving forward. An enthusiast might notice the hood has louvers from a later model Z, and period correct alloy wheels.\u00a0\nThe interior condition is very encouraging and original. While never a certainty, it generally portends of a well-cared for example when a car's interior is clean with minimal wear and tear. This lovely car can be purchased one of two ways. Either as is without further mechanical or cosmetic enhancements, or with a detailed restoration contract. Considering the rarity and very high value of show quality Z cars, a more substantial investment may\u00a0be worth considering. Priced aggressively in its current condition.\nPlease call to discuss either option.\n",

        "description": "Up for sale is a Super Rare 1967 Land Rover 109 Forward Control. This Truck came from South Africa and was one of the rare ones that was well preserved. It was used has a extreme safari vehicle, and was retired and later restored. Comes with Clean Florida Title.\nThey were made until the early 70's and later on ceased production. Very few were actually manufactured, and most of them that did were never sold to the civilian market. Most of the Forward Control were sold as work trucks, and were generally worked hard. This hard work combined with relatively low production numbers, means that few Forward Controls survive. Many of the survivors are conversions (e.g.. camper vans and fire engines) that led a less strenuous life. This distinctive vehicle was based on the Series II 109\" chassis but had the cab positioned over the engine, resulting in a greatly increased load space. A new rear sub-frame was attached to the 109\" chassis to produce a flat load space. The result was a vehicle rated at carrying 30 cwt on the road, and 25 cwt cross-country.\nThe original engine was a 4-cylinder 2.25-litre diesel engine and now has a more reliable Chevrolet 250cid Straight-six engine. You can find parts easily for this engine and order them online as well. Has 4-speed transmission. Check out my video of the 109 FC driving. It sits really high and is just cool to drive! It has 2 radiators, one with one big fan and the other radiator with 2 fans. Car runs cool! It has really nice brown upholstery that was redone. Has a roof latch that lets you access the roof area. Also has a full storage area in the back. Has the rear guard bar with full spare. You can also but your bicycle in the back. It also has a water tank. Lots of really cool features. Apparently less then 2,500 were made!\u00a0\nI'm located in Miami about 30 minutes away from the airport. Feel free to come see the Truck in person. Any inquires email me. Sold As-is where is. $500 non-refundable deposit. For those interested you can call me at 305 five four two 5662. If I don't answer just leave me a voicemail. Like any cars there's always your normal regular wear and tear items. Buyer responsible for pick up or shipping car. Thanks for looking. Really rare opportunity. \u00a0\nIf you're looking to finance I would recommend JJ Best. They can finance your classic car or hot rod and are very pleasant to work with.\n",

        "description": "The FL\u00a0is a model designation used by\u00a0Harley-Davidson\u00a0since 1941. In 1965 the Electra-Glide was upgraded with an electric start but the big change was in 1966 when the Panhead gave way to the new \u201cShovelhead\u201d. It had an aluminum head with a different-shaped combustion chamber and rocker arms attached to the rocker cover instead of to the head itself. By 1969 the factory \u201cKing of the Highway\u201d package included a removable batwing fairing on the handlebars, hard saddlebags and a top case at the rear. 1970 was the year that AMF took control of Harley-Davidson and significant changes were made to the FLH which included relocating the ignition inside the gear case cover and the generator was replaced with an alternator inside the primary case. In 1972 a front disc brake was added. When it was brand new this particular example was optioned with the \u201cKing of the Highway\u201d package in addition to a Harley stereo pod with stereo and speakers. Other than the wear items this bike is all original. Not only that but it is a 2 owner bike that the current owner purchased in 1985 and has an incredibly low 20,404 miles. The second owner purchased it with just over 19,000 original miles and has barely ridden it since. It was recently serviced and runs incredibly well. Everything is working as it should and it is need of nothing but a new home. If you\u2019d like that to be your home we suggest reaching out right away!\n",

It is also lovely car as is,\nand could be enjoyed fully in its current condition. While not a\nhigh-end restoration, Roadster Salon upgraded the interior several\nyears ago and put it through our certification process. Paint was\ndone by the previous owner in a custom color.

He had it consigned at a local dealer who I purchased the car from. One of only 792 produced in \"Calypso Coral\" paint code. The paint is all original with the exception of the passenger front fender that had a repaint back in the 70's. Still shines beautifully but does have nicks, dents, chips, and scratches from its 60 years of existence. 41,000 miles believed to be original but not noted on title.\u00a0\nAll original Drivetrain that has only been serviced and resealed as needed. Recently I upgraded the front drum brakes to a Wilwood 6 piston Disc brake with power assist. I was able to utilize the original hubs. I upgraded the suspension with a \"wild Horses\" 2-1/2\" lift kit. Very nice progressive springs that ride ultra smooth. I installed Bilstein Shocks on all 4 corners and added US Mag 5 slots with 30x 9.5 15 BFG All Terrains. Great stance. Transmission is the original 3 on the tree manual. Differentials are factory 4.11 gear.\u00a0\nThe interior was originally white but needed replacement. Seats were redone in Black with houndstooth inserts. The floors were fully insulated and covered in custom fitted German Square weave carpet. I added a Retrosound stereo that has bluetooth with Mic for phone calls with Infiniti speakers. there are also two USB plug ins. An all new Vintage air AC and heat unit was installed that makes driving in the summer much nicer.\u00a0\nIts nearly impossible to find a Bronco in such original unmolested condition. Ive kept the original Brakes, springs, heater box etc just in case anyone wanted to bring her back to stock.\u00a0\nVehicle is Listed Locally and in other advertising outlets and we reserve the right to end this listing at any time.\n",

        "description": "The era of Digest-sized \"Custom Rodder\" will come to life for the owner of this unique 1957 Chevrolet built by Joe Cusumano. Car crafting had gone toward a more radical approach as the 1960s era began, and this creation ---- aptly named Legacy ----- captures that theme from every angle. Of course, programs of this nature began with a 'hot mill,\" as the writers would say, in the case a crrca-1962 327 CI Corvette V-8 engine with extensive detailing and equipped with a front-mounted 6-71 crankshaft-driven blower kit. Using period - appearing side-draft carburetors, gold and chrome plating with custom hand\u00a0engraving abound on this powerplant, while a Hurst shift arm directs the transmission behind it. From the exterior, one notes the roofline ---- which came from a 1957 Buick ----- is chopped 3 inched and then channeled 5 inches at the front, graduating to 2.5 inches at the rear. The rear fender wells are boxed and the fender ends themselves were extended 6 inches and raised 1.5 inches, with 1959 Cadillac tail lights installed. Even the trunk is shopped 8 inches. A 1961 Chrysler front fender assembly showcases extended angular headlamps, with the front fender wells flared with 3/4-inch chromoly tubing and boxed to conceal wiring. Metal fabrication was utilized throughout the build with no fiberglass. A 1962 Jaguar independent rear suspension (widened 8 inches), front suspension and Jaguar universal joints provide underpinnings and components are either gold or chrome plated. The engine rests in hand-built motor mounts, while brake and gas lines have been enclosed within the modified square-tube frame. The deep tones selected for the paint are dramatic, with a power blue custom interior inside. The most modern upgrade beyond that is a set of Colorado Custom wheels that put it to the pavement through BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires. Through a car club jacket is not part of the sale, you'll feel like you are part of a select group of owners with Jim Cusumano's Legacy.\u00a0\n",

        "description": "1956 Chevrolet \u201cSport Sedan\u201d 4-door Hard-top For Sale In Minot, North Dakota 58701\n\u00a0\n1956 Chevrolet \u201cSport Sedan\u201d (4 door Hard-top) and it\u2019s a 2-10, not a bel Air. History: I bought this car back in 2009 as a project. It was headed for a \u201cturn into a convertible\u201d project. It had no engine or transmission in it. The body was all there and most of the trim was complete. The first thing I did was pull the body off the chassis. I had the chassis blasted and painted chassis black. Then the body went off to get body worked and painted. I went with the color it was\u2014Harbor blue and India Ivory. The paint was a modern color Harbor blue.\nI will describe the car as I remember. I have done the work and have owned this car since 2009. Let\u2019s talk about the drivetrain. It has a GM 350 Crate motor with an Edelbrock carb. The transmission is a Metric 200. It has new U-Joints, and the rear end is stock. Today, the 6 th of May 2023, I removed all 4 wheels, inspected the brakes and cylinders, the drums, and the hoses, and they are all good. Pictures attached. I then cleaned the wheels and white walls, re-installed them, and torqued all lug nuts to 95-foot pounds. Note here: The rear tires and rims come off the car without disconnecting the shocks like some of the resto-rods need. The steering is very nice and easy. I had installed the \u2018poor man\u2019s power steering\u2019 bearing idler arm kit and it is nice. The original wheel makes the car steer very easily. The shocks were all new. The chassis was black and the under body of the car is blue. You can see that there is no rust on the floors.\n\u00a0\nThe body has ZERO rust. It was solid to start with and has always been in heated storage when not driven. Over the years that I have owned this car, it has had less than 4,000 miles on it. The speedo gear is off quite a bit, so the odometer reading is over what is shows which is 4,300 and some miles. It runs down the road very nicely.\n\u00a0\nThe stereo system in the car is nice and sounds great! I have a radio in the dash only for a filler. The under-dash unit works great and BOOM\u2019s as it should.\n\u00a0\nThe interior is done like it should be back in 1956. New seat covers, new carpet, bladder type padded dash, new visors, new headliner (my favorite part of the car), new door panels and the door sills were the last set NEW in the country! They are beautiful.\n\u00a0\nIt has a nice new firewall pad and the under dash is nice. It has new wiring.\n\u00a0\nIt was Safety inspected back a few years ago and passed with flying colors.\n\u00a0\nYou can drive and show this rare beauty to any car show with great results, and you will be the talk of the town!!! Fly in and drive it back to your home\u2026enjoy the ride!!\u00a0\n",

        "description": "HIGHLIGHTS:\nOPTIONS INCLUDE:\nThe magnificent 1979 Porsche 930 911 Turbo 3.3 Sunroof Coupe featured here is finished in stunning Black over a Black leather interior. This investment grade 930 Turbo is among one of the finest examples we have offered in years. This exquisite example was featured in Autoweek magazine on July 11, 2016 and has been meticulously maintained to the highest standards. We are proud to offer this incredible 930 Turbo to the most demanding collector, investor, or enthusiast who desires to own one of the very best!\nModel History:\nAs such, the Turbo name quickly became synonymous with high performance, albeit performance that demanded the talents of an experienced driver: This is a wickedly fast car that can easily punish those who do not approach it with skill and respect. Of course, this only added to its appeal and is still renowned for its driving dynamics today. Also, while the 930 served as the homologation basis for Porsche\u2019s fearsome 934 racers, it was no stripped-down track weapon. Turbos were luxuriously equipped, with a long list of standard equipment including air-conditioning, full leather, a rear wiper, headlamp washers, and a stereo. Further options, including a power sunroof, were offered as well.\nIn 1978, Porsche updated the model with a larger 3.3-liter engine with a stated US-market output of 253 horsepower, an air-to-air intercooler, revised suspension, and new brakes. With the US emissions restrictions tightening once again in 1980, 1979 became the last model year that the Porsche 930 was specified for the American market for some time to come.\n",

        "description": "The Nash Metropolitan, also sold under the Hudson, Rambler and Austin marques, was a very small sub-compact car sold between 1954 and 1962. It was designed in the United States by William J. Flajole for Nash-Kelvinator International. At first, the cars were to be sold as the NKI Custom. While the design was American, the cars were built in the United Kingdom\u2014the bodywork was built by Fisher & Ludlow while the mechanicals and final assembly were by the Austin Motor Company.\nIt was the first time an American-designed car had been entirely built in Europe. While most U.S. automobile makers were following a \u201cbigger-is-better\u201d philosophy, Nash Motor Company executives were scrutinizing the market to offer American buyers an economical transportation alternative. It was designed as a \u201ccommuter/shopping car\u201d with resemblance to the big Nash, but on a significantly smaller scale. Owners reported that the \u201cMetropolitan is a good thing in a small package\u201d.\nIt is powered by the Austin A50 1489-cc, 52-hp engine coupled with a three-speed manual transmission.\nRecent Service includes New brake hoses, oil/filter change, heater hoses, coolant flush, wheel cylinders, ignition coil, rebuilt/refurbished Carburetor , and newer radial tires\nIncluded with the sale Jack, Jack bag cover and a New soft top\nAll of the lights are functioning\n\u00a0\n",

        "description": "Intro\nThis is a 1973 BMW Euro-version 2002tii with sunroof, A/C, and 4-speed transmission.\u00a0It was sold new in Germany and then imported to Japan in 1978, where the owner stored it in a dealer showroom for many years so it has very low mileage. A restoration was done several years ago and included a rebuild of the engine, transmission, and injection pump. It has aftermarket air conditioning, 2002 Turbo sport seats, RS Watanabe wheels, upgraded shocks and springs, MOMO Prototipo steering wheel, and Marchal headlights. The vehicle is in California.\nExterior\nDuring the restoration the car was repainted in its original Golf yellow. The seller notes a rust bubble in front of and behind the left rear wheel well and a few on the lower R door. The spare tire bay bottom was replaced, and exhibits some surface rust. This 2002 has a factory sunroof and aftermarket RS Watanabe wheels which are a replica of the popular Minilite wheels.\u00a0It\u00a0features the round taillights of an early 2002 which gave it the nickname \u201croundie\u201d.\u00a0The bumpers were rechromed, and the suspension was lowered with firmer springs and shocks added for better handling. The seller notes the ride is firm but enjoyable and the car handles well. An ANSA performance exhaust and brighter Marchal headlights were also added. The tires are a newer Japanese brand.\nInterior\nThe black interior was reupholstered during the restoration in new aftermarket vinyl and the carpet was replaced. The front sport seats are from a 1974 BMW Turbo. This 2002tii has the stock Euro-version gauges with additional gauges for oil pressure and ammeter. It has an aftermarket MOMO Prototipe steering wheel and an AM/FM Japanese radio. The seller noted some small cracks in the dash and tear in the headliner.\nMechanicals\nThis 1973 BMW 2002tii has only 55,000 kilometers on the odometer (around 35,000 miles). The vehicle restoration was done several years ago and included a rebuild of the engine, transmission, and fuel injection pump. The seller notes that there are no noticeable leaks and vehicle was recently inspected and serviced.\nSummary\nThis BMW 2002tii has the desirable round taillights and popular upgrades consisting of sunroof, A/C, 2002 Turbo sport seats, additional gauges for oil pressure and ammeter, MOMO steering wheel,\u00a0firmer suspension, ANSA exhaust, alloy wheels, and upgraded headlights. It has benefited from a complete service and can be inspected and test driven anytime.\n",

        "description": "Making its\u2019 debut at the Turin (Italy) Motor Show in November 1966, the Maserati Ghibli coupe made waves within the automotive industry.\u00a0 When deliveries of production cars began in March 1967, the Ghibli had evolved from the two-seat prototype into a fastback 2+2 touring coupe that Sports Car International magazine would later rank in the Top 10 on its\u2019 list of top sports cars from the 1960\u2019s.\u00a0 A total of 1,170 Ghibli coupes were manufactured from 1967 until production ended with the 1973 model year.\nTastefully appointed in a medium blue livery with a tastefully contrasting tan leather bucket seat interior, the Ghibli is powered by a front-mounted 4.7L dual overhead cam V8 engine displacing 306 horsepower backed by a five-speed manual transmission.\u00a0 The dash holds full instrumentation, including a 180 MPH speedometer.\u00a0 The car also has air conditioning, something rare on 60\u2019s era sports cars.\u00a0 An under hood factory tag indicates this car to be the 74th Ghibli ever manufactured.\nThis vehicle has been a part of the present owner\u2019s automotive portfolio since May 2021 and has been driven occasionally during his ownership.\u00a0 The car has been housed in a humidity controlled environment since he became the custodian of this rare vehicle.\u00a0 The car\u2019s odometer reads 16,571 miles which we believe to be correct but in accordance with Missouri statutes concerning the sale of motor vehicles the Ghibli will be sold \u201cmileage exempt\u201d due to age.\u00a0 The owner has recently acquired the original prototype Maserati Ghibli Spyder and has decided to offer this vehicle for sale.\nEvergreen Digital Showroom offers this exceptional and rare Maserati for sale at a price of $350,000 USD.\u00a0 As with all of the vehicles we offer for sale, a pre-purchase inspection is welcomed and recommended.\u00a0 We will gladly arrange transportation of this vehicle at buyer\u2019s expense or will work with the shipping company of buyer\u2019s choice to facilitate delivery.\u00a0 For additional information or to make an offer on this car, call sales manager Steve Russell at 417-532-8000.\nNOTICE\nBecause of the number of vehicles we represent we cannot drive every vehicle for long distances.\u00a0 These vehicles have been part of static displays for long periods of time, in some cases for decades, and are subject to the flaws and imperfections consistent with that.\u00a0 While we do our best to disclose all issues we known about a vehicle in our advertising, these are old cars and something that has always worked in the past might not function properly today.\u00a0 Please check the requirements of your state regarding the licensing and registration of classic vehicles and make sure the vehicle you are looking at meets those if applicable.\u00a0 Unless otherwise noted, all vehicles represented by Evergreen Digital Showroom possess a clean (non-branded) title which will be provided the new buyer when purchase funds clear our financial institution.\u00a0 Virtually all our vehicles are sold as mileage exempt due to their age.\u00a0 We do not warranty any vehicle, nor any part of the vehicle including air conditioning systems, brake systems, electrical systems and gauges, fuel systems, accessories or powertrain components.\nThese are old vehicles and it is very common for them to require certain maintenance and upkeep for them to be operational.\u00a0 In many cases issues with leaks may develop when being driven after a long period of not being used.\u00a0 This is common, as classic cars at some point will leak fluids.\u00a0 For this reason, we do not encourage buyers to attempt driving their purchase home as we cannot guarantee functional reliability of these vehicles.\u00a0 We strongly encourage prospective buyers to be sure they are comfortable with these issues before purchasing a classic car.\nDescriptions of vehicles represented by Evergreen Digital Showroom are intended to be informational in nature and do not in any way constitute any sort of warranty, expressed or implied. \u00a0\u00a0Again, these vehicles are presented \u201cas-is, where-is\u201d without guarantee or warranty.\u00a0 Vehicles manufactured prior to 1981 will likely not be included in the databases of companies such as CarFax and AutoCheck that provide vehicle history information to consumers. \u00a0\u00a0If you have specific questions regarding a vehicle we urge you to contact us at 417-532-8000.\n",

        "description": "The 4-4-2 (also known as the 442) is a muscle car produced by Oldsmobile from 1964 \u2013 1987. Originally it was introduced as an optional package for the F-85 and Cutlass models. The 2nd generation was introduced in 1968 which is when the 442 became its own model. In 1969 the changes were subtle and included a division tooth between the grilles, the wing windows were deleted, trunk lid inlets were added for the tail lights and headrests were added to the front seats. This particular example is believed to be a 4 owner car with 38,268 original miles. It retains its original 396026 400ci V8 engine that was professionally rebuilt by Jimmie\u2019s Motor Rebuilding Co. out of Peru, IL in August of 2021. At the same time the original T400 transmission was also rebuilt and both now have less than 1,000 miles on them. It is fed via an Edelbrock 4 barrel carb and Performer intake. It is sparked by an electronic ignition and exhaust is handled by a set of performance headers and a new performance dual exhaust system which sounds just plain nasty when you get into it. At the same time the engine was rebuilt the suspension received new springs and pads and the brakes received a new master cylinder, wheel cylinders and lines. It also received new steel braided fuel lines, vacuum lines, transmission lines, coolant lines, a new water pump and a new radiator. It was repainted in its original color of Red about 20 years ago which has held up very well but is starting to show its age. All the weather stripping was replaced when the engine was done as well and everything lines up and closes as it should. The interior is all original with the exception of the B&M slap shifter and the aftermarket gauges. Everything works as it should except for the voltage meter and the gas gauge. When it was repainted it was also upgraded with the W-32 dual snorkel air intake which is 100% correct. Pictures of the engine casting and serial #\u2019s are posted below. The car is an absolute pleasure to drive and in need of nothing but having a couple of gauges repaired. Based on the current NADA values we would conservatively appraise this beauty at $49,600. We have priced it much lower than that to get her sold quick so if you like what you see don\u2019t wait until it is too late to contact us!\n",

Overall, the paint looks good and shows well but there are some bubbles in it around the sunroof area.\nOverall the interior looks good. There are some hairline cracks in the das as you can see in the pictures.\nMechanically the engine runs but the car is not drivable, it needs a clutch. The brakes are a little sticky due to sitting for some years.\nA nice car overall, needing mechanical work.\nAny questions welcome.\nPlease message or call Frank Sajjad at 2166452100.\n(We can help to make arrangements for worldwide shipping.)\nShipping cost to Rotterdam or Felix Stowe, UK is $1,700\n\u00a0\n",

        "description": "The Gran Turismo (GT) Hawk is a grand touring coupe that was sold by Studebaker from 1962 -1964. It was Studebaker\u2019s top of the line model that evolved from the 1956 Golden Hawk. The 1962 model was brilliantly redesigned by Brooks Stevens by putting on a new grille, shaving off the fins and adding a new squarer roofline. Despite the fact that the Studebaker engine was heavy for its size the GT Hawk boasted performance and handling not typically found in an American made car. This particular example is equipped with its original 289ci V8 rated at 225hp and is mated to a Flight-O-Matic automatic transmission. It was optioned with A/C, a clock, a tachometer, deluxe floor mats and a gorgeous two-tone interior. It was repainted in its original color of Studebaker Blaze Red about 10 years ago and it still shows like new. It is a rust free car that was relocated from Colorado to the Midwest just after being repainted and has not seen a winter since. Everything but the clock works as it should. The A/C was just serviced and blows ice cold. The car has 75,929 original miles and is need of nothing but a basic service and a new garage to park in.\n",

A wonderfully spacious tourer packed with class, Jaguar's flagship where they loved to show off all their gadgets and new gizmos. The fastest four-seater in the world when the car first rolled off the assembly line. The car was rarely delivered as a coup\u00e9 anyway, which now makes this a real collector's item.\nAnyway, enough about investment and performance, let's talk about what lasting impression this car leaves behind. After all, a Jaguar driver also knows that you have to drive this car with respect. That means that the sports hangover of yesteryear should purr quietly, not roar. It is sometimes said in the car world, the car looks like its owner. However, this tomcat also knows how to take the owner with her grandeur. Indeed, when you get in, you immediately get the feeling that you know about opera, wine, politics and poetry.\nOurs? Dutch delivered! A 6-cylinder what feels slightly more favourable in terms of consumption and weight ratio than the 12-cylinder and can still slot in well. Fully taken care of on the operating table so you can enjoy this classic car carefree. To top it all off, fully documented too! That's a tasty start, right?\n- \"Money may not buy happiness, but i'd rather cry in my Jaguar than on a bus\"- Fran\u00e7oise Sagan\n",

        "description": "Arizona Truck | Rust Free Body & Frame | Original Powertrain \u2013 318ci V8 & Automatic | Beautiful Red & White Two-Tone Color Scheme | 31\u201d Tires & 15\u201d Chrome Ram Wheels | Power Steering & Power Brake | Factory Air Conditioning | Interior in Very Good Condition\nSince the early decades of the 1900\u2019s Dodge has been engineering and manufacturing trucks for the American people, but it was not until 1981 did Dodge release their Ram pickup truck series that people know and love today. The first-generation Dodge Ram trucks were manufactured from 1981 to 1993 and are known for their boxy and utilitarian design. This 1985 Ram pickup truck is one of the cleanest examples you will find from this generation of Dodge trucks.\nThis Ram is a hard-to-find and desirable vehicle for a couple reasons. Being that this vehicle is originally from Arizona, it is rust free. Secondly, it came from the factory equipped with a short bed and full 4WD functionality. This truck is also powered by its original powertrain as it sports its original 318 cubic inch V8 engine that is mated to an automatic transmission. The 4WD shifter sits in the middle of the floor in the cab making it easy to shift into the functional 4WD system. The vehicle shows about 82,000 miles, but total mileage is unknown. The exterior is in great shape and has a very dashing appearance as its bright red and white two-tone color scheme is separated by black and gray pinstripes that can be seen around the entirety of the vehicle.\nMoving to the suspension, this truck has been upgraded with a Rancho suspension and sits on 31\u201d Dick Cepek all-terrain tires and 15\u201d chrome Ram wheels. The truck features both power steering and power brakes with disc brakes up front. All these features result in a ride that is both comfortable and safe for a classic truck like this one. The interior of this single cab truck is in very good condition and features no rips or tears. You will be cooled down by the factory air conditioning system and will be switching through the different stations through its modern radio system.\nIf you are in the market for a classic pickup truck that will make you feel like you are back in the 1980\u2019s then this is the truck for you. Its stock appearance, original powertrain, and super clean body and frame is what makes this vehicle look like it recently came off the showroom floor.

        "description": "1923 Peerless 66 Speedster \u2013 \u201cThe Fearless Peerless\u201d\nChassis No. 66A604\n70 bhp, 332 cu. in. L-head V-8, three-speed manual transmission, solid front axle, semi-elliptic leaf spring suspension, and rear-wheel drum brakes. Wheelbase: 128 in.\nVintage speedsters have been produced by enthusiasts on a variety of chassis, but this is one of very few built on the basis of a Peerless, the Cleveland-built car considered one of the \u201cThree P\u2019s\u201d of great American motoring, alongside the famous Packard and Pierce-Arrow. Peerless was renowned in its time for its durable, conservative engineering, reflected in the long-term reliability of its product.\nFormer owner Ivan Jones and his late wife, Audrey, of Littleton, Colorado, spent the late 1970s painstakingly gathering parts for the car from points East and West. Mr. Jones was a car aficionado and skilled craftsman. Inspired by the speedsters produced by Peerless in the teens, they then built this automobile, together, by hand, completing it in 1981. The car is well-finished, with fenders reminiscent of Brass Era performance cars such as Simplex and American Underslung, a 1922-23 Peerless radiator shell, Peerless Model 66 drum headlights, and cream wire wheels, shod in blackwall tires.\nThe interior features two bucket seats, in the manner of the Mercer Raceabout, forward of a large original Peerless-badged oval gas tank with fillers on both ends, wooden storage box, and dual rear-mounted spares. All components except for the body panels are Peerless, with the seats and teak dashboard being Mr. Jones\u2019 own creations. The windshield frame was cast from a wooden prototype made by Mr. Jones. He even went so far as to shoot the elk that donated its hide to the seats, lovingly upholstered by Mrs. Jones.\nPower is supplied by a 1923 332 cu. in. Peerless V-8 and three-speed transmission, on the original frame, all acquired after years spent powering a sawmill in the Midwest. Side exhaust emerges from the right side of the hood and disappears under the body, a touch reminiscent of period Grand Prix cars as well as supercharged Duesenbergs. Current owner added a gear-vender overdrive for comfortable cruising speeds.\nIvan and Audrey Jones subsequently traveled the United States with the speedster that they dubbed \u201cThe Fearless Peerless.\u201d Together the trio enjoyed several tours with the Veteran Motor Car Club of America. Among its duties was leading the parade lap for Indy drivers at the Denver Grand Prix in 2006, driven by longtime friend Jimmy Aretakis. It was also well-known in print, appearing on the cover of the May/June 2002 issue of the VMCCA magazine,\nThere are few more distinctive, fun vintage speedsters than this car \u2013 a truly one-of-a-kind creation, with robust, well-proven performance and bodywork crafted with love and care. It is genuinely thrilling to drive and ready to add more adventures to its long history.\n",

As the only American-designed, mass-produced passenger car with a\u00a0rear-mounted,\u00a0air-cooled engine,\u00a0the Corvair was manufactured and marketed in two-door coupe, convertible, four-door sedan, four-door station wagon, passenger van, commercial van, and pickup truck body styles in its first generation (1960\u20131964) as well as two-door coupe, convertible and four-door sedan in its second generation (1965\u20131969).\u00a0In 1962, Chevrolet introduced the Corvairs with few changes at the beginning of the year. The bottom line 500 series station wagon was dropped and the 700 became the base station wagon. The \"Lakewood\" name was dropped. The ever-popular Monza line then took on a wagon model to round out the top of the line. In spring of 1962, Chevrolet committed itself to the sporty image they had created for the Corvair by introducing a convertible version.\nThis first year convertible is really a great, low-mileage example. This is a high performance (102hp) Super Turbo-Air model with the corresponding \"YN\" engine code and crossed racing flags on the deck-lid. It spent most of its life in Georgia and most of its 57 year history is known. After being stored and never driven once between 1974-1989 it was purchased by the 2nd owner. He drove it periodically and decided to complete a restoration in 2004. Photo documentation of this first restoration accompany this sale. The seller also provided us with a large stack of documentation including GA registration history, period literature, original dealer badge, and several receipts. When we received the Corvair this year it had just enough wear that we decided to complete a second restoration. Our first step was to leave the Corvair with a local expert who did a complete rebuild of the drivetrain. We then did a complete repaint in the original Antique White. The battery is new and the Corvair just received a full tune-up. The final addition was a set of 185/80 R15 White Wall Tires! Needless to say, we think we have this 72k mile example standing tall and ready for the next owner to enjoy. Contact us today for further details or to start the ownership process.\nAdditional photos and similar at *** www.TXCLSX.com ***\n",

        "description": "This is an original, stock, surviving example of one of the most recognized & sought after Personal Luxury cars of the time. You made it in life, if you had one of these. Unique lines combined with that front and back end that only a top of the line Lincoln would possess. Power & a Ride like no other but only room for a few good friends.\nCurrent owner is a true Ford & Lincoln fan, and has owned this Mark III for about 14 years now. He found it in North Jackson Ohio and it was originally delivered new by the Lincoln dealer in Ambridge Pa. New battery and tray, 4 new shocks, new calipers & pads, brake cylinders & shoes completed fall of 2021. Though driven little, you are seeing it in it\u2019s natural condition without any professional detail. Oil and filter change every year or two. Owner is also a Torino fan and has one of those. Can\u2019t drive them all! 4 extra original hubcaps go with the car.\n\u00a0\nFor more information and photos visit our site at www.autoconnectioncars.com or call Chad at 330-353-1750\n\u00a0\nDETAILS OF CAR:\n\u00a0\n460 V-8, Auto Temperature Control Air Conditioning & Heating, Unique Factory Vinyl Top, AM-FM Stereo, Power Steering, Power Brakes, 6 Way Power seats on driver & passenger side, Auto Transmission, P Antenna, White Wall Radials, Inside Trunk Release, Remote Drivers Mirror, Traction Lock with 2:80 highway Gearing. Tilt Steering Wheel, Sure Track Braking, Reclining Passenger Seat, Split Bench Seating. Also includes an owners manual (see pics) \nMarti Report and Marti window sticker included / title Indicates \u201cactual\u201d Mileage\n\u00a0\nPaint\n\u00a0\n* Paint has a very nice reflective shine and a finish that looks much as when they were produced in that era. Slight orange peal as typical.\n\u00a0\n* Paint matches well all the way around the sides and upper surfaces\n\u00a0\n* Looks and seems to possibly be all or mostly all original paint that it was born with. Read comments in magnetic paint gauge section for explanation.\nWe can\u2019t be 100% sure since owner hasn\u2019t had car since 1971 when new\n\u00a0\n* See pictures for details of small defects that exist in paint finish.\n\u00a0\n* There are a few nicks and worn spots (above left rear tire) in the paint. A couple or more nicks on fenders, doors, and quarters and a few scuffs not completely through the paint and might possibly be polished out. (see pics)\n\u00a0\nBody\n\u00a0\n* Body panels in general are very nice and straight.\n\u00a0\n* Exceptions being 3 very slight dimples you can see on the hood and 1 slight dimple in the pass side door, but only at just the right angle and under high intensity lighting. (see pics)\n\u00a0\n* Fits and gaps around hood, trunk, and doors are very consistent with what you would have expected to see when car was new. (See pics)\n\u00a0\nMagnetic Paint Gauge\n\u00a0\n* \n\u00a0\n* Hood and trunk readings were consistently in the 4 to 5 mils range. This in our opinion would more likely be consistent with an aged and polished original surface vs a repainted surface.\n\u00a0\n* Side panels (front to back), readings were typically in the 4 to 6 mils range with below the lower body line being more in the 2-4 mils range.\n\u00a0\n* Along bottom of all body panels showed no higher readings indicating repair of rust or paint.\n\u00a0\n* inspection of door jambs did not indicate any obvious signs of repaint or over spray and actually showed human & weatherstrip wear consistent with use and older paint.\n\u00a0\nBright work\n\u00a0\n* \n\u00a0\n* Overall bright works has a nice highly reflective finish and shows well.\n\u00a0\n* Bright work surrounding windows is very reflective with some scratching below drivers door glass and typical pot metal pitting on molding immediately behind the LR window. (see pics)\n\u00a0\n* Moldings running along the top of fenders and doors are very shiny and mostly flawless. ( couple little scuffs)\n\u00a0\n* Door handles are very reflective with just a few typical scratches along the top.\n\u00a0\n* Drivers rear view mirror shell is very reflective with a small amount of pitting on top.\n\u00a0\n* Grill work, front and rear bumper all have good reflective qualities but show a little bit of light wear\n\u00a0\n* Rear bumper middle has light impact crease running top to bottom and has affected the molding directly above (see pics).\n\u00a0\nGlass\n\u00a0\n* Windshield, rear glass, and all 4 side glass all have the Car-Lite emblem\n\u00a0\n* Glass is all nice and clear. We do not see any discoloring, delamination, bulls eyes, cracks, or any wiper wear.\n\u00a0\n* Windshield may have a few pin head sized nicks from normal driving and drivers window does have a group of light vertical scratches at top from normal window movement (see pics).\n\u00a0\nVinyl Top\n\u00a0\n* \n\u00a0\n* Seams running down both sides are in good condition without any signs of splitting apart.\n\u00a0\n* There are a couple little bumps by lower right rear window glass but top doesn\u2019t show signs of significant rust issues under material ( see pics)\n\u00a0\n* Coloring is a dark green but does have some areas of slightly lighter appearance. Professional cleaning or dressing may offer some improvement (see pics).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMechanical\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTest drive\n\u00a0\nChad rode with the owner for about a 5 mile ride in the country. Chad then drove back on different road conditions. The engine and transmission seemed to perform smoothly and correctly. Car steered, turned, stopped, and accelerated as you would expect. Braking was smooth without pulsation or pulling. Ride was beautifully smooth and quiet. I would say the car pretty much operated as it was designed to. Premium fuel and lead additive recommended.\n",

        "description": "All vehicle trades considered including classics and performance.\u00a0 We can assist with financing and shipping as needed.\nThis Lola T492 is one of the nicest Sports 2000 cars you will find.\u00a0 With approximately $50,000 in recent maintenance and upgrades, this one is ready to go.\u00a0 It is mechanically sound with a recent engine rebuild and many other items as described below.\u00a0 Further, it looks fantastic with recent paint and body work along with the plated roll bars.\u00a0 There is also a nice cache of documentation and spare parts.\u00a0 While you may find plenty of old race cars on the market, few offer this level of readiness.\nThe first of the car\u2019s three logbooks was issued by the SCCA on September 9, 1978 for the SR2000 class.\u00a0 Its first recorded race was an SCCA event at Lake Erie in May 1979.\u00a0 It was subsequently raced throughout the United States (SCCA) and Canada (CRDA).\u00a0 It was later raced in vintage classes with SVRA, HSR, and VS2NA.\u00a0 It was most recently on the track at Road America in April 2023.\nThis car has seen three stages of rebuild and refurbishment in recent years, thus its exceptional condition.\u00a0 The first ran from 2010-2012 and consisted of new plating on the tub, new skid plates, replacement of the roll bar and bracing, nickel-plated bulkheads, Kephos upright coating, and fresh outer tub skins.\u00a0 The rear subframe was media blasted, repaired, and powder coated, while a replacement fiberglass body from Motorsport Composites was fitted.\u00a0 Both the engine and gearbox were rebuilt as were the suspension and braking systems.\u00a0 New wheel bearings, hubs, and CV joints were\u00a0also installed. \u00a0Finally, the car received new\u00a0rain and brake lights along with headlight wiring. \u00a0\nThe second stage of refurbishment was from 2019-2021.\u00a0 This involved replacing all rod ends, the fuel cell, and the fire suppression system.\u00a0 The roll bars were extended and now reach to the driver\u2019s feet.\u00a0 A carbon fiber splitter was fabricated and installed along with a new wicker bill.\u00a0 The rear disc brakes were moved outboard for improved cooling and easier maintenance.\u00a0 The car also received new Koni double-adjustable shocks and Aurora rod ends. \u00a0A quick-release OMP steering wheel, RGE wiring harness, and Racetech instruments were also installed along with a fuel gauge. \u00a0In addition, the engine received a fresh rebuild and a new Fireball ignition, throttle cable mount, and Burns stainless steel exhaust.\nThis was followed by a third stage of work completed in early 2023.\u00a0\u00a0The body was sent out for a variety of fiberglass repairs along with a full repaint.\u00a0 The seat was reconfigured from a custom molded unit to a new Kirkey setup with fabricated brackets.\u00a0 This arrangement offers far more flexibility for the next owner, though the old Lola fiberglass seat is also included. \u00a0Note the Sabelt six-point harness is good through 2024.\u00a0 Finally, a nut-and-bolt check was performed followed by track time at Road America in April 2023.\u00a0\nThis Lola\u2019s drivetrain starts with a Ford 2.0L inline-4 with a dry sump oiling system, Mocal oil cooler, and Weber carburetor.\u00a0 Its most recent rebuild was in 2021 by Elite Engines of West Bend, WI with only 9.0 hours since.\u00a0 The fuel pump, fuel lines, test port, and filter were all replaced as well.\u00a0 Cooling is provided by dual side mount aluminum radiators with updated water pipes and blue SAMCO hoses.\u00a0 The transaxle is a Hewland Mk9 dog box 4-speed that was rebuilt by Averill Racing Stuff with a new ring and pinion, shift forks and springs, reverse idler gear, pinion bearing, and input shaft seal. \u00a0The hydraulic clutch received a new release bearing, master / slave cylinders, and a reinforced clutch arm. \u00a0Braking is provided by Wilwood 4-piston calipers, vented floating rotors with alloy hats, Hawk brake pads, powder coated hard lines, and a Raceparts bias adjuster.\u00a0 The black 13\u2033 Revolution alloy wheels wear Avon racing tires.\nLiterature includes the previously mentioned log books along with Lola system diagrams, Ford and Hewland data sheets, and a setup notebook.\u00a0 Spare parts include extra wheels and tires, eight additional gear sets, a fiberglass seat, intake manifold, coilovers, starters, brake cooling ducts, and many other miscellaneous parts as shown in the gallery.\u00a0 Also included are the spats that were removed from behind the rear tires.\u00a0 Note this vehicle is not street legal and does not have a title; ownership will be transferred via bill of sale only.\nThe S2000 class is very popular and offers plenty of racing opportunities on a reasonable budget.\u00a0 Further, this Lola is easy to drive and will perform at the limit, with lap times in the upper 2:20\u2019s at Road America (most recently run in April 2023).\u00a0 It is in race-ready condition and has been professionally maintained by Wynnfurst Racing for the last few years.\u00a0 Whether you are looking to venture into amateur racing or augment an existing stable, this one has a lot to offer.\n\u00a0\n",

        "description": "1970 Ford Mustang Mach 1 w/ 351 Cleveland and 4 Speed Top Loader Close Ratio Transmission\nWe are representing this beautiful matching numbers 1970 Mach 1 for it's current owner. The owner took the photos.\nThe car is well documented and has 2 ring binders of paperwork. We will show some of the documents in our photos. There is the Marti Report as well as the original Ford dealer order. There are also receipts for almost every part changed or added to the car.\u00a0\nOur seller purchased the car about 3 years ago. The books that came with it document everything right down to a wiper switch and battery hold down. Other examples are the installation of the 15\"Magnum 500 wheels in 1995, motor rebuilt in 1996, front end rebuilt in 2017 with the addition of disc brakes at that time.\nSince our seller purchased the car there is a grocery list of items that he either installed, upgraded or replaced. He did not change the car in any way that would take away from it's matching numbers originality, just improved a great car. He also kept any original part he may have removed.\nHere is just a recap of most of them.\u00a0\nAs I mentioned before, there are receipts for all major parts and everything the previous owner did. You will receive the books with the car. The 8-Track rebuild cost over $1200. alone.\u00a0\nThis is a very nice Mach 1. The current owner knew it had some cosmetic issues, which we show in our later photos, but it did not bother him. It is hard to find a really nice matching numbers documented Mach 1 today. According to the Marti Report, this car is one of only 2987 produced with this engine and transmission set up and one of only 1952 with this exact paint and trim combination. He is very meticulous and mechanically you won't have to do a thing to this car. It runs and drives great.\nWe are limited to the number of photos in our ads, but if you are a serious buyer, I can send almost 200 photos in a file. Please be sure to watch the video to hear this car run.\u00a0\nFeel free to call me at any time with questions, which I am sure you will have. Call 214-616-2317. I can also assist with shipping and financing. \u00a0Thank you for viewing our ad.\n",

Since she hasn\u2019t been exposed to road salt, her frame and undercarriage are solid and making her worthy of the investment required in a Classic Gentleman restoration. There is nothing more important for a 35 year old Grand Wagoneer than it comes from the right areas of the country that have kept their frames and undercarriages out of the winter road salt. Frankly for us, it is the difference between a restoration candidate or a parts car.\nCarfax confirms the lifetime Texas registration, no accidents reported and the low 108,xxx miles as original and true. (That works out to just a little more than 3,000 miles per year\u2026.).\nWe have scheduled this \u201987 to be finished in the popular and seen next to never gorgeous Spinnaker Blue Metallic paint finish but there is still time for the next owner to pick whatever color they would like. Have a look at the restoration page on our website to see how considerable our full color conversion process is. Here is just one specific, we even paint the metal floors under the new floor carpeting the new color.\nOUR FRAME OFF RESTORATION PROCESS\nExterior cosmetic restoration works:\nInterior cosmetic restoration works:\nElectrical/mechanical works:\nEngine:\nModern fuel injection includes:\nTransmission & 4 wheel drive systems\nAir conditioning & coolant systems\nBraking, wheel components & undercarriage\nKey electrical components & parts replaced\nWhy buy from a Grand Wagoneer specialist?\nOur entire focus is on Grand Wagoneers and we know these unique vehicles inside and out. When you purchase a Classic Gentleman Wagoneer it has been thoroughly inspected and works completed by professional mechanics, some with over forty years of Wagoneer experience. We purchase fine example Jeeps from a variety of sources including other dealers and private parties. We are often told by the seller, \u201cMy Jeep is excellent and needs nothing\u201d however, being in this profession, we know to expect and plan for a great deal of sorting. Remember the average age of these vehicles is over thirty years old and even with loving care many the cosmetics and mechanical parts have aged and worn accordingly. When a Classic Gentleman Grand Wagoneer arrives at your home, it is a special occasion and the Grand will be in beautiful condition. Yes, our sales are as-is, but as you will see from our detailed document files that your Grand has been looked after carefully. Our goal is to see that the joy and enthusiasm of Grand Wagoneer ownership begins immediately with your purchase and that it will be there for years to come.\nBe sure to have a look at our website\u2019s\u00a0recommendation page\u00a0where you can see first hand the positive experiences of a worldwide assortment of named buyers. We deal honestly and work hard to insure a happy buyer. You will never be chased for a sale but given all the time needed to insure if a purchase is right for you. Guided by these principals, our modestly sized niche dealership has built a loyal and devoted customer base spanning 5 continents.\nYou are welcome to ring 724-996-1288 for a cordial discussion regarding this example or any other in our current or soon to be on offer extensive inventory.\n\u00a0\n",

No major dents, dings, chrome has some peeling, but the undercarriage and rocker panels are very solid, and the car has no 'structural' rust, minor pockets of surface rust and oxidation in the spare tire well, and around the car, like any other car this old.\nNo Service history, as this car was a Trade in, that was not driven daily in the last 10yrs, and it seems to be\u00a0from Southern California. Owned by\u00a0a middle aged\u00a0couple,\u00a0stating that they\u00a0lost interest, and decided to move on to a different venue of car. The current owner had owned the car a few years prior to\u00a01997.\u00a0\nFeel free to request more info, or pictures.\u00a0 OR call us directly 65o=~344=~111 seVen\u00a0 (scam filter)\n",

        "description": "All vehicle trades considered including classics and performance.\u00a0 We can assist with financing and shipping as needed.\nThis 1962 Impala SS has a lot to offer.\u00a0 To begin, this is a real black-over-red Impala SS; no color changes or fake badging here.\u00a0 It underwent a refurbishment in 2010 that included new paint and many new parts.\u00a0 It still wears a number of period modifications from the 1960\u2019s and is powered by a fresh dual-quad 327.\u00a0 And while some of these classics change owners frequently, this Impala has been with the same individual for 55 years!\u00a0\nThis one has a colorful history.\u00a0 Its last owner purchased the car in 1968 when he was 16 years old.\u00a0 The car was well-known on the street and had been fitted a variety of performance parts.\u00a0 This included a Corvette 327 fitted with a cross-ram intake (necessitating the teardrop style hood).\u00a0 While the car won plenty of races, it was also the owner\u2019s primary transportation, getting him through high school and then tech school.\u00a0 They continued through life together.\nAfter decades of service, the car received a major refurbishment in 2010.\u00a0 This included replacing the floor pans, trunk pans, and some cross bracing.\u00a0 It was repainted in its original code 900 Tuxedo Black with four coats of clear.\u00a0 It was recently buffed as well for a nice shine.\u00a0 Most of the brightwork remains original including the front grille.\u00a0 The car was also fitted with 15\u201d Weld aluminum wheels and Goodyear Eagle tires. \u00a0\nThe 327ci engine received a professional rebuild by Dick Skarlupka in 2019 with approximately 4,000 miles since.\u00a0 The 3782870 block was bored 0.060\u201d while the crankshaft was turned 0.010\u201d/0.010\u201d.\u00a0 It was fitted with 10.5:1 pistons to give healthy compression but still work with pump gas.\u00a0 The rotating assembly was balanced to 9,000 rpm for smooth operation.\u00a0 The valvetrain was fitted with hydraulic lifters and roller rockers, and the double-hump cylinder heads received hardened valve seats.\u00a0 Up top is the vintage Edelbrock X-C8 intake topped by dual Holley carburetors.\u00a0 Such a great period setup!\u00a0 There is also a 4-core radiator and headers feeing a dual exhaust with cutout plates.\nThe automatic transmission was upgraded from a 2-speed Powerglide to a 3-speed TH350 with a shift kit and lockup torque converter.\u00a0 The driveshaft was rebuilt accordingly and a new center support bearing installed.\u00a0 The Positraction rear end received new bearings and seals.\u00a0 Additional mechanical work included going through the front and rear suspension along with the steering components, and the braking system was upgraded to front discs with a dual reservoir master cylinder.\nThe factory code 875 red vinyl SS interior received some updates too.\u00a0 The bucket seats were redone with new foam and upholstery, while front and rear seat belts were installed.\u00a0 The carpet was replaced and comes with a set of rubber floor mats.\u00a0 A trio of underdash gauges was installed along with a column mounted tachometer.\u00a0 All the lighting works properly including the low / high beams, running lights, brake lights, turn signals, backup lights, dash lights, and courtesy lights.\u00a0 The horn, wipers, heater, and parking brake all function properly as does the aftermarket digital radio.\u00a0 A spare tire and bumper jack reside in the cavernous trunk.\nThis Impala just oozes character!\u00a0 It is a beautiful, solid car with a great blend of vintage and current upgrades.\u00a0 And with all the recent work it is in excellent mechanical condition as well.\u00a0 While you may be able to find another nice black/red \u201962 SS, this example is a real standout and has an incredible run of ownership.\u00a0 You won\u2019t find many like this one.\n",

        "description": "1973 MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE, SAME OWNER LAST 45 YEARS.\nNice 1973 Mustang convertible that has had 3 owners since new. First owner was a woman who drove the car for only a few years, second owner bought and sold it to his friend who has kept the car for 45 years.\nIn 1982, 41\u00a0years ago he had it repainted in the original color and he had the interior redone at the same time.\nExcept for that the Mustang has been used sparingly, it today has\u00a0128.500 original miles on it. The 302 engine has never been worked on and it\u00a0runs absolutely excellent still. The transmission was rebuilt recently. The car drives\u00a0almost like a Cadillac, no rattles or strange noises and it runs\u00a0and drives down the road probably as well as it did in 1973.\u00a0\nThe car is not a show car but an excellent driver as is. It needs nothing to be used for local car shows or on Sunday trips with your sweetheart!\nAnd it is priced\u00a0accordingly.\u00a0\nThe Mustang is in Phoenix, Arizona and it is sold with a clear Arizona title.\nIf sold on export we can arrange transport to port in Los\u00a0 Angeles.\n602/931-6000\n[email\u00a0protected]\n",

        "description": "The Continental is a luxury car produced by Lincoln starting back in 1939 with the introduction of the Zephyr convertible. The 3rd generation Continental was produced form 1958 \u2013 1960 and marked a significant body design to separate itself from the Mercury line to enable Lincoln to outdo Cadillac. With an overall length of 227 inches the 3rd generation Continentals were the longest mass produced vehicle ever sold in the U.S with the exception of the very rare 34-37 Cadillac V16 convertibles. For 1959 the Mark IV saw minor changes with the restyled grill that enabled the headlights cluster to be integrated into the egg crate grille. Standard equipment is the 430 ci V8 mated to a 3 speed Turbo-Drive automatic transmission. This particular example was finished in a gorgeous Copper Poly paint with a Glacier White vinyl interior and top.\u00a0 It is nicely optioned with 6-way power seats, power locks, power vent windows, a heater & defroster, a locking gas cap, rocker panel moldings, a \u201cTravel Tuner\u201d AM radio with dual speakers and white sidewall tires. It is a 4 owner car with 97,846 original miles and everything is 100% original with no restoration work of any kind having been done. It was just serviced and tuned up. The tires and battery were changed not long ago so she is in need of nothing but a new home. Based on its present condition and factoring in the flaws you will find in the paint, interior and trim work we would classify this as # 3 vehicle and as such would appraise it at $48,700. We are serious about finding it a new home and have priced it accordingly. If you have been looking for one of these you know what you have just found so you best contact us before it is too late!\n",

Internally referred to as W121 (BII or B2), it was first shown in prototype at the 1954 New York Auto Show, and was available with an optional removable hardtop.The 190 SL was powered by a new, slightly oversquare 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) Type M121 BII 1.9 L straight-four SOHC engine. Based on the 300 SL's straight six, it had an unchanged 85 mm bore and 4.3 mm reduced 83.6 mm stroke, was fitted with twin-choke dual Solex carburetors, and produced gross 120 hp (89 kW; 122 PS). In detuned form, it was later used in the W120 180 and W121 190 models.\nDescription:\nThis is an unfinished Mercedes-Benz 190 SL project. Finished the throughly prepping process, the car was painted original white color . Painting process started with epoxy primer, seam sealer and finished with high grade PPG paint. Result was a perfect \"bondo free\" smooth body. Many interior parts were already redone, but there are still some parts to be properly finished. All brakes, suspension, sub-frame, Differential and miscellaneous parts were carefully media blasted, and are ready \u00a0installed back to the car.\n",

The top is a Gator top that has been replaced but is the original style and color. The interior is mostly original as well with only the door cards replaced along the way. The only modifications made to this Charger were to lower the suspension, as well as fitting aftermarket wheels. Purchased by the current owner in 1994, the Charger has been stored indoors and seldomly driven. The drivetrain is not numbers matching but is period correct. Other notable options this Charger features are bucket seats, power steering, tachometer, interior light package, hood mount turn signals, AM w/ 8 track, and more. This would be the perfect driver or starting point for a restoration or resto-mod as it is complete, runs and drives well, and has very minimal body surface rust where paint has been chipped or scratched. Overall a legendary piece of Americana and a great addition to any collection.\n",

Purchased new by the current owner's grandfather on March 26, 1963, at Ames Ford in San Rafael California. This special example left the factory in Rangoon Red with a red interior, a 390 cubic inch V8 with a 4bbl carburetor paired to a Cruise-a-Matic, a 3.00:1 ratio axle, and power steering. It has been garaged and pampered since new and it shows. It includes the original owner's manual and information tags.\nThe exterior still wears its original Rangoon Red paint which has held up phenomenally. The chrome, trim, emblems, hubcaps, original issue black & gold California license plates, glass, and lenses are equally well-preserved making this attractive old Galaxie an anomaly and a glimpse of 60 years into the past.\nInside is equally as amazing and completely original including upholstery, door cards, panels, headliner, dash, gauges, and even the carpet is factory original. The car is comfortable and quiet inside with all working gauges, the only inoperable item is the clock. It is a lovely ride indeed. The trunk still has its original panel cars, mat, spare, and jack instructions.\nThe original factory 390 cubic inch engine fires up effortlessly and has excellent power. It runs smoothly, quietly, and burns clean. The braking, steering, and handling feel tight though the steering rack is leaking and should be renewed in the not-too-distant future. It is a truly amazing experience to drive such a low-mileage, well-preserved vintage Ford!\nBe sure to check out all 370 photos and the video at www.leftcoastclassics.com.

        "description": "1990 Mercedes-Benz 300SEL\nVery nice, well-preserved 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300SEL for sale finished in black with a parchment leather interior. This is my personal car that I have decided to let go of as I'm downsizing my small collection. It was purchased new in California and has remained here since new. It comes with a clear, California title and clean Carfax report.\nThe 3.0 Liter engine starts easily, runs and idles smoothly and clean with plenty of power, and passes the California smog inspection without issue. The shifting is tight along with the braking and handling. It is a very nice driving W126 all around.\nThe exterior shows nicely and all of the paint looks to be original and well-preserved with only the front left fender looking to have been repainted. The trim, glass, and lenses all look nice however the chromed factory wheels are corroded so its new owner may wish to strip and repaint. Otherwise, it's a great-looking car that appears to have spent most of its life indoors.\nThe interior is immaculate. The leather on the front seats is in excellent condition having been covered in sheepskin for years. All systems are in very good working order though recently the radio reception has failed. The gauges, switches, horn, and lights all work well and the air conditioning blows cool at 62f though I will add a can of refrigerant to top it off before delivery/shipping. The trunk is equally nice with tools, jack, and spare all present.\nYou'll notice in the trunk the personalized \"W126\" California license plates, these were on the car when I purchased and I am happy to transfer them to the new owner should they decide to use them.\nBe sure to check out the nearly 300 photos and the video at www.leftcoastclassics.com.

        "description": "What would Chevrolet do if they built a 1970 K-10 in vintage style today? That is exactly the question that this restoration project was designed around. Built in the factory as a K-10 Short Box with 4x4 option, the restoration was completed by the very talented JD Lusardi at Street Rod Factory in Mountain Home, Idaho, a builder with Riddler Award winning involvement in his history. According to the owner and JD, no stone was left unturned in this frame-off restoration. Now sporting a rebuilt LS V8 and rebuilt 4L60e automatic transmission, the truck now has the power needed to feel like a modern sports truck. Everything underneath was powder coated and polished where possible to create a beautiful show piece. A Rough Country 4 inch lift was installed to better fit the white lettered 33\u201d tires, which are wrapped on 18\u201d Detroit Steel Smoothie wheels. These wheels are retrofitted to fit the factory dog dish hubcaps for the true vintage look. Looking around the exterior, the Chevrolet Victory Red color may have never looked so good with lots of clear coat sprayed on top, sanded and polished as best as possible. An all new bed and floor were installed to insure no filler or rust, and every piece of chrome is new on top of that.\nInside, the all new interior features a beautiful leather wrapped bench seat, dash cover and door cards. To keep it still vintage style, the builders opted for keeping the manual crank windows and leaving the headlight dimmer switch on the floor. Modern touches such as a retro looking radio with Bluetooth, Dakota Digital retro looking gauge cluster with LED displays, and Vintage Air keep the ride comfortable and modern. Whether you are looking for a show truck or one to enjoy, this K10 4x4 is an excellent option for either.\n\u00a0\nRestoration Highlights Include:\nRebuilt 2005 LS V8\nReworked Heads with Larger Valves and Stiffer Springs\nLarger Camshaft\nNew Water Pump\nNew Oil Pump\nRebuilt 4L60E Transmission\nFlowmaster Mufflers\nRebuilt Transfer Case\nNew Front and Rear Axles - 3:73 Ratio\nNew Vintage Air System\nDakota Digital Gauges\nAnd Much More\n\u00a0\nVIN:\u00a0 CS140Z160860\nMileage Shown at Listing:\u00a0 28\n\u00a0\nPlease contact us with any questions, for more information or a shipping quote.\n",

One of the most significant show cars built in this era of the Ghia-Ford relationship is the Megastar. With a very exaggerated \"greenhouse\" feel on the outside and inside with amazing visibility, the sides of the car are 80% glass! Aerodynamics were in full effect with a wedge shape, low centre of gravity and round smooth sides, this was the beginnings of the modern supercar age where this shape defined the futuristic supercars of the era. It certainly was influenced by a few previous Italian designs such as the 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo concept by Bertone, the Ferrari P5 and P6 by Pininfarina and of course Ghias own DeTomaso Mangusta and Pantera designs. Based on the Ford Granada chassis, the Megastar is powered by a pretty powerful 3 liter V6 and an automatic transmission for comfort. It even has dual exhaust that has a pretty aggressive tone. The inside certainly has an Italian feel with a leather wrapped dash and Italian sport steering wheel, but the shapes are very futuristic with a mid-century twist with square shaped gauges and a mechanical analog clock smack center of the dash. Four color keyed bucket style seats with very defined futuristic cushions give it a very spaceship feel. Originally upon its completion, the Megastar was revealed at the 1977 Geneva motor show where I am sure it gained some big attention. It was also shown at the 1978 Chicago auto show on the Ford stand. From then on the Megastar disappeared into the storage facilities of the Ford Motor Company. Now on offer for the first time and in fully serviced running and driving condition. Contact us today for more information\n",

Beginning production in 1953 with the iconic 100-4, Austin Healeys 4 cylinder model which proved to be extremely popular for both road\u00a0and racing purposes. After a while Donald Healey just couldn't\u00a0squeeze any more power out of his trusty Austin 4 cylinder so he upgraded to a straight six cylinder overhead valve Austin unit with twin SU H6 carburetors producing 130 horsepower, a huge upgrade from the previous 4 cylinder engine. The 100-6 proved to be extremely popular becoming the basis for the iconic 3000 to follow and the rest was history.\nOffered here is a wonderful 1958 100-6 that is really sharp in its Florida Green and Old English White color combination. It\u2019s overall condition is really nice with very nice paint and very nice black interior accented with white piping. The white wire wheels are also really sharp wrapped in Dunlop tires. Mechanically it runs really well and it drives great. If you are looking for a great 100-6 than this Florida Green and white Healey should certainly be considered.

        "description": "The Hudson Motor Car Company was an automobile manufacture that produced vehicles in Detroit, Michigan, from 1909 until 1954. The name \"Hudson\" came from\u00a0Joseph L. Hudson, a Detroit department store entrepreneur and founder of\u00a0Hudson's\u00a0department store, who provided the necessary capital and gave permission for the company to be named after him.\u00a0\nHudson caused great excitement to the U.S. auto industry with its new \u201cstep-down\u201d unibody in 1948. The unibody made the Hudson Commodore lighter and stiffer than more conventional designs, and also reduced weight, all of which meant the cars were actually quite capable. The new design was aerodynamic and surprisingly fast and set the car apart from most everything else on the road.\nComing to us from a well-known Hudson collector, RB Collection is pleased to offer this rare, desirable, and meticulously restored 1949 Hudson Commodore Convertible Brougham Model equipped with a Super Eight 254-cid, 128-hp straight-eight engine, VIN 494153232, with an attractive Roman Red paint over an exquisite burgundy leather interior and convertible top. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe low center of gravity and powerful eight-cylinder engines made Hudson\u2019s some of the best-performing postwar cars and they have become collectors' favorites. This 1949 Hudson Commodore 8 convertible is a perfect example of the appeal of these cars. Powered by the 128hp 254 cubic inch eight-cylinder engine, it has been thoroughly restored to pristine condition with excellent paint, a gorgeous interior, sharp chrome, and a thoroughly prepared and cleanly presented engine compartment. It has a 3-speed manual transmission, hubcaps, trim rings, wide whitewalls, rear wheel fender skirts, power windows, radio, heater, power top, grille guard, and the original Owner\u2019s Manual.\nWe are very pleased to offer this outstanding example with exceptional restoration as a rare opportunity of acquiring a vehicle that represents American history.

The B introduced new front and rear sheet-metal, while retaining the curved front trunk lid and rounded fenders of the A series. The B also added some features requested by American customers, such as raised front and rear bumpers with over-riders to better protect the body from parking incidents. The headlamps were raised, a larger hood handle was added, and front vent windows appeared in the doors. A new steering wheel and column similarly refreshed the interior, along with redesigned rear seats.\nThe 356 B also reflected Porsche\u2019s continuing effort to improve the line\u2019s mechanical components, with stronger engine internals, transaxle, shifting linkage, and better Alfin brakes. The \u201cSuper\u201d model with raised compression added an extra 15 brake horsepower to the standard version\u2019s 1.6-liter, air-cooled, flat, four-cylinder engine.\nThe magnificent, one family-owned 1963 Porsche 356 B 1600 Super Cabriolet featured here is finished in gorgeous Heron Gray (Off-White) over Black leather with a Black folding convertible top. This stunning 356 B 1600 Super was delivered new on November 14, 1962 to Porsche Car Pacific in Burlingham, California to its original owner who cared for it for many years until passing it down to his son, who would later decide to commission Porsche expert Dick Highland to perform a show quality, no expense spared multi-year restoration before showing it at the 2018 New York International auto show. This car was also featured in a Porsche-commissioned IFC short film (LINK HERE) as well as shown at many Concours events. We are proud to offer this investment-grade Porsche to the most sophisticated investor, collector, or enthusiast who aspires to own one of the best!\n",

        "description": "Details\nThis one-year-only model 1958 Edsel Citation is powered by a 410 cubic inch (6.7L) V8 engine and backed by a three-speed automatic transmission sending power to the rear wheels. Less than ten thousand Citations were built, and this restored example is finished in the factory Frost White and gold and is complimented by cloth upholstery in the same colors. The car features a Teletouch push-button actuated automatic transmission found on the center of the steering wheel. Other features include a rotating carousel-style speedometer, along with other amenities such as power windows. Mechanically, the car is equipped with coil spring front suspension and a four-barrel carburetor. The five-digit odometer shows 79,038 miles, but the actual mileage is unknown. It is located in Englewood, Colorado\nThe third-party photos and inspection represent well the condition of this Edsel. The car was restored by the owning family around 2007, and the condition is evident in the photos. Further restoration photos are available. The exterior white paint shows typical scratches and chips that one would expect on a car of this age. Small spots of surface rust can be seen on the interior and exterior of the vehicle, and the car\u2019s power steering has limited functionality. The interior of the car is a matching two-tone white and gold with the hallmarks of fifties styling. Some wear on the dash and minor wear in the upholstery are evident, and there is also a crack in one of the lower shrouds of one of the seats, and the radio does not currently function. Mechanically, the car runs and drives as intended by the manufacturer. The car is in overall good condition and still reflects the older restoration performed. The original owner\u2019s manual and one set of keys are included in the sale.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis Edsel is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Englewood, CO.\n\u00a0\nAbout the model\nThe Edsel Citation was a family of full-size cars that debuted for the 1958 model year. The Citation was offered in two-door hardtop, four-door hardtop, and two-door convertible body styles and was Edsel's flagship model. This family of rear-wheel drive cars was powered by a 6.7L V8 engine paired with a three-speed manual transmission. Due to Edsel's commercial failure, the Citation was only offered for the 1958 model year before being discontinued, with a total of 9,299 examples made.\n\u00a0\nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nOwnership History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n",

Restored around 1990 and includes some records, a photo album of the build, and a clear California title.\nThe 1991cc inline 4-cylinder Triumph engine was rebuilt 12k miles ago. It starts easily and runs smoothly with plenty of power. Shifting is nice and smooth and the clutch was just serviced. It has excellent braking with new rear shoes and cylinders installed and newer front brakes as well. The front suspension was renewed fairly recently so handing is nice making for a fun driving experience.\nThe cockpit is comfortable and complete with all gauges and lights/blinkers in good working order. The interior is clean, comfortable, and ready to enjoy. The outside was restored years ago and shows well though there is some blistering in the paint which I've covered in detail in the video. The top and side curtains are in good shape with nice fitment. The wire wheels are wrapped in an older set of Firestone 165 R15s with plenty of treads but should eventually be replaced due to age. Overall this is a nice-looking classic Morgan, best described as a \"good ten-footer\".\nBe sure to check out all 270 photos and the video at www.leftcoastclassics.com.

        "description": "All vehicle trades considered including classics and performance.\u00a0 We can assist with financing and shipping as needed.\nHere is a vintage Corvette that is much more affordable than so many others but is still an exceptional car.\u00a0 We are talking about a 1979 model with the optional L82 engine, rare M21 close-ratio 4-speed transmission (7.5% of production), glass T-tops, air conditioning, Gymkhana suspension, aluminum wheels, power windows, and more.\u00a0 It looks fantastic, is very fun to drive, and has a long maintenance history.\u00a0 Further, this Corvette is exceptionally well documented with a GM invoice, original bill of sale, dealer paperwork, financing records, and receipts dating to the early 80\u2019s.\nThis C3 has only had two owners and shows 67k miles.\u00a0 Built in St. Louis in March 1979, it was sold new at Adcox-Kirby Chevrolet in Chattanooga, TN and remained with its original owner until 2020.\u00a0 It still looks great in its dark blue metallic paint and glass T-tops (which are etched with the last six digits of the VIN).\u00a0 This one also has the optional D35 sport mirrors and the N90 slotted aluminum wheels with brand new 255/60R15 tires.\u00a0 Everything looks factory stock; no add-on spoilers, badges, luggage rack, or other such items.\nUnder the hood is the higher performance L82 engine rated at 225hp.\u00a0 Here too everything appears original though the single catalytic converter has been removed and a true dual exhaust installed.\u00a0 The oil pan has been replaced also.\u00a0 The engine starts right up, has a nice idle, and moves this \u201979 right along.\u00a0 The M21 close-ratio 4-speed (which was only available with the L82) shifts smoothly through all the gears and really adds to the fun factor of any C3.\u00a0 Additional features include power steering and power 4-wheel disc brakes.\u00a0 The fully independent suspension was factory equipped with the FE7 Gymkhana setup and has four new shock absorbers.\u00a0\nThe optional black leather interior appears stock as well.\u00a0 The seats received new foam and upholstery in 2022 so they feel as good as they look.\u00a0 Additional interior options include a tilt / telescoping steering column, power windows, and an electric rear window defogger.\u00a0 The car was also equipped with factory air conditioning that\u00a0has been converted to R134a.\u00a0 There is also a vintage dealer installed AM/FM/CB radio with a working 8-track tape player!\u00a0 Note the CB antenna has been removed. \u00a0The headlights, wipers, heater, defroster, horn, turn signals, parking brake, courtesy lights, and power windows\u00a0all work properly.\nThere are plenty of C3 Corvettes on the market but not many like this one.\u00a0 Aside from being in remarkable condition, it has a great list of performance options and features that can be hard to find.\u00a0 It also has documentation that you don\u2019t often get with a car from this era.\u00a0 Yet all this is priced less than the dealer mark-up on a C8 Z06, making it a perfect way to join the Corvette club without breaking the bank.\n\u00a0\n",

This GTO was equipped with front power disc brakes along with power windows and steering. Other features include the hood-mounted tachometer and Endura front bumper. The car was the recipient of a frame-off restoration by a previous owner at an unknown date. It is currently in Warren, New Jersey.\nThe quality of the restoration performed on this vehicle is evident in the third-party photos and inspection. The black paint is deep and shows well in the photos. The hideaway headlights and power top both function as they should. The Rally wheels are also in good condition, but the next owner will need to monitor the tread depth of the tires. The Parchment colored interior has no rips or wear, and the dash shows no cracks. The teak wood three-spoke steering wheel is also in good restored condition. The inspection report includes a video of the engine idling smoothly, and a test drive revealed the vehicle to be in good working order.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis Pontiac GTO is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Warren, New Jersey.\nFinancing options are available through our recommended lenders. Please find options here.\nAbout the model\nThe second generation of Pontiac GTO was introduced in 1968. The second-gen GTO saw updated styling, and various mechanical upgrades, as well as the introduction of a 455 cu. in. V8 in 1971. One of the most notable GTO variants were cars fitted with The Judge package, that was a stripped GTO made to compete with the Plymouth Road Runner. For 1972, the GTO returned to being an option package for the Pontiac LeMans.\nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nOwnership History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n",

The Kenmeri designation comes from ad campaigns that ran while the car was on sale featuring a couple, Ken and Mary. Although very rare in the U.S the Kenmeri Skyline has become one of the most recognizable Skyline body styles and has achieved legendary status stateside. The Kenmeri is the last of the classic Skylines and the models that followed until the R32 series paled in comparison on styling and performance. This Skyline has been tastefully modified with SSR wheels and GT-R style exterior components. The Skyline also features an SK racing intake manifold and triple Mikuni carbs which really brings out the sound and power in the L20 I6 engine. Overall the Skyline is in great shape and would make a great addition to any collection.\n",

They were functional, tough, and always had the needed accessories to pull off the rescue or get-a-way.\nBlack Horse Garage is proud to represent this adventure truck, a 1972 Chevrolet K20 pickup.\nFor this truck, Black Horse Garage drew inspiration from the action TV series \u201cThe Fall Guy\u2019. While its not the same make or color as that one, we were looking for a similar feel. This K 20 has been blacked out everywhere including tinting the windshield and windows. Like the Fall Guy, we added a roll bar with 8-inch KC lights, side steps, a front bully bar, and KC off-road lights.\nThat was just the beginning though. Here is a list of some improvements made and accessories added on at Black Horse Garage:\nOne of the biggest things we did was give the K20 power steering with the EZ Electric power steering kit. It makes the truck easy to drive, steer, and handles tremendously. It\u2019s a lot of truck!\nAll action trucks have a larger than life feel and this one is no exception. It has been given a lift with a Rough Country 4-inch lift kit. Five-inch leaf spring bolts and new killer Nitto Ridge Grappler tires complete the look.\nThis K20 is a beast, so it has to sound good as well. We installed Flowmaster headers that have the most aggressive sound in the Flowmaster line. It also has a Flowmaster universal exhaust kit. The kit has cross pipes with cutouts that balance the exhaust pulses for increased torque and horsepower.\nWe had to install a 120-amp alternator to handle all the additional power needs for the Chevy truck. It has LED lights inside and out. Modern and vintage are mixed together with an Alpine Apple Play digital multimedia receiver with 7-inch touchscreen and a CB radio with whip antenna. Safety features are abundant as well with not only a back-up camera, but two side cameras with an independent viewscreen.\nThe K20 has less than 39k miles on it. It is powered by a Chevy 350, 5.7 -liter V-8 engine with a 4-barrel carburetor. It has a 4-speed manual transmission and is a 4\u00d74.\nIf you would like to make an appointment to see this 1972 Chevrolet K20 in person, please call or text 203-947-5293 or send an email to\u00a0\n",

        "description": "This 1966 GTO Hardtop Coupe was built in Pontiac, Michigan in the 3rd week of May, and delivered to Lou Meliska Pontiac in Parma, Ohio. The car is finished in Burgundy (N-N) over a Black (223) interior and came equipped with a WT code 389, 4-speed transmission, and 3.55 rear end. The car is PHS documented and received a GM Award of Excellence at Carlisle in 2010 shortly after the restoration was completed.\nThe car is the result of a frame-off rotisserie restoration and it is drop-dead gorgeous. The bodywork on the car is very straight, and the gaps on the GTO are tight and nice throughout. The glass is all in very good condition and was replaced during the restoration. All of the chrome is new and all of the stainless is either new or restored. All of the rubber seals on the car were done as well at the time of the restoration. Overall, it\u2019s a beautiful show car.\nWhile the body was off the frame, the frame was stripped to bare metal and refinished in the proper GM satin black. All the suspension and steering components were replaced as well including all of the bushings, tie rods, ball joints, and brake components. The steering gearbox was also upgraded to a quicker ratio 12:1 unit.\nThe interior is all redone and looks crisp. The dash has the factory tach, and the car is equipped with a factory console and push-button radio. All soft panels are new including the seat covers, door panels, carpets, carpet underlayment, headliner, dash, and package tray.\nThe engine was cast on March 10th, 1966 and the engine casting number is 9778789. It\u2019s important to note that GM did not stamp VIN codes on these motors until late 1967, so calling them \"matching numbers\" would not be the correct usage of the term. What we can say about this car is that the engine was cast a few months before the build date of the car and that it is a WT code that matches the PHS docs we have with the car. During the restoration, a Tri-Power setup was added to the car, however, the correct 4bbl intake, carb, and air cleaner have been retained with the GTO. The GTO is equipped with the correct 4-speed wide ratio transmission and YH safety track 3.55 gears.\nThe car runs very well, is properly tuned, and is a blast to drive. With the faster ratio power steering and power brakes, it\u2019s also easy to maneuver, and with the 3.55 gears, you get a good balance of quick acceleration and easy highway cruising.\nFor the GTO nut wanting a PHS documented, drop-dead gorgeous Goat, this one is for you!\n",

Wikipedia details only 1560 Grand Wagoneers rolled off the Toledo assembly line in 1991 and whilst other sources quote slightly higher final year production numbers, still 1991 is the lowest production year as Chrysler ended production on June 21th, 1991. A fresh new color was added to the line and it would only be produced in the final year \u2013 HUNTER GREEN METALLIC. This unique color would be selected to represent the Grand Wagoneer in the Chrysler Museum and the last Grand to complete on that final day was also a Hunter Green model. Even from the start the factory execs knew this was one beautiful color contrasting with the wood tone applique. How rare are these? The most often quoted production number is 150 \u2013 that number could be plus or minus a few \u2013 but you get the idea- they are really rare. Few vehicles in modern automotive history have been produced in such limited numbers. Each time we acquire a \u201991 Hunter Green Grand Wagoneer we feel quite fortunate that we have the opportunity to restore one to its original glory. This is truly a Benchmark vehicle for the discerning collector . Industry experts predict that Grand Wagoneers will continue to appreciate in the coming years and that 1991 models will be at the forefront of that appreciation- especially the rare Hunter Green edition.\nThis investment grade Final Edition was just a two owner piece until our acquisition and apart from our purchase, the only state shown on the Carfax is the southern state of Arkansas. Her former owners cherished this Grand and past down from one to the other was the original window sticker. ($30,289.00 was the sticker price, if your are curious). The 147,200 miles are shown as actual (still under 5,000 miles per year) with no accidents reported against her.\nThe frame off restoration is extensive, from a newly remanufactured original spec 360ci V8 engine, rebuilt transmission to a whole host of other cosmetic and mechanical/electrical works with the highlights detailed below:\nOUR FRAME OFF RESTORATION PROCESS\nExterior cosmetic restoration works:\nInterior cosmetic restoration works:\nElectrical/mechanical works:\nEngine:\nModern fuel injection includes:\nTransmission & 4 wheel drive systems\nAir conditioning & coolant systems\nBraking, wheel components & undercarriage\nKey electrical components & parts replaced\nOur entire focus is on Grand Wagoneers and we know these unique vehicles inside and out. When you purchase a Classic Gentleman Wagoneer it has been thoroughly inspected and works completed by professional mechanics, some with over forty years of Wagoneer experience. We purchase fine example Jeeps from a variety of sources including other dealers and private parties. We are often told by the seller, \u201cMy Jeep is excellent and needs nothing\u201d however, being in this profession, we know to expect and plan for a great deal of sorting. Remember the average age of these vehicles is over thirty years old and even with loving care many the cosmetics and mechanical parts have aged and worn accordingly. When a Classic Gentleman Grand Wagoneer arrives at your home, it is a special occasion and the Grand will be in beautiful condition. Yes, our sales are as-is, but as you will see from our detailed document files that your Grand has been looked after carefully. Our goal is to see that the joy and enthusiasm of Grand Wagoneer ownership begins immediately with your purchase and that it will be there for years to come.\nBe sure to have a look at our website\u2019s\u00a0recommendation page\u00a0where you can see first hand the positive experiences of a worldwide assortment of named buyers. We deal honestly and work hard to insure a happy buyer. You will never be chased for a sale but given all the time needed to insure if a purchase is right for you. Guided by these principals, our modestly sized niche dealership has built a loyal and devoted customer base spanning 5 continents.\nYou are welcome to ring 724-996-1288 for a cordial discussion regarding this example or any other in our current or soon to be on offer extensive inventory.\n\u00a0\n",

The Acapulco Thing was built from May to July 1974 only, and a mere 400 were produced in total. All were white with blue accents on the front hood, the rocker panels, the bumpers and the dashboard. The seats were upholstered in a blue-and-white striped fabric, and the same fabric was used for the standard surrey top that was stretched over a metal tube frame.\nThis car is a true time capsule wearing its original paint (with the exception of drivers front fender due to a minor scratch years ago) Paint shows nicely with a little fade from age and minor scratch's, chips, and imperfection from use over the years. Extremely solid and rust free with the exception of a very small spot of rust in front of the right rear fender and behind the drivers front fender (close up pictures in gallery)\nOriginal interior in great shape for its age, the blue has some fading in front. The original floor mats are intact except for the passenger rear which has gone missing. All gauges, wipers, lights,\u00a0 and radio work great.\nRuns very well and drives out nice. Shifts easily and the brakes feel great.\nLook Close at all the pictures, there are so many little tags, stamps, and details that this Acapulco Thing retains because it is original with low miles. Restored ones lose all of those original details. Many people restore their regular \"Things\" to look like Acapulco Things so don't get fooled by a fake!\u00a0 This is the real deal and they are only original once!\nWorldwide shipping available, please email me for a Quote.\n",

        "description": "Coming out of 30+ Year Storage | Turtle Top Package | Original 351 V8 Engine & Auto Trans | Original Shag Carpet Interior | Features CB Radio & Decals from 80\u2019s | Original Turbine Wheels | Nostalgic Time Capsule Representative of the Era it\u2019s From\n\u00a0\nThis 1979 Ford F150 featured here is part of the last year of production for the 6th generation F series pickup trucks, an iconic American model that has been a staple in Ford\u2019s lineup for nearly three quarters of a century. Not only is this truck a short bed and a mainly original example of this generation of F series, but it is also representative of the time that it is from with its retro color scheme and its different memorabilia and gadgets.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is difficult to find a truck like this in clean condition, which can be explained by the fact that this truck has been in storage for nearly 40 years. The truck is a real time capsule as it still sports its inspection sticker from 1984 as well as a city of Chicago and town stickers from the same year. Other vintage decals include NRA stickers on either side window and a hunting club the owner must have been a part of back in the early 1980\u2019s. These pieces of memorabilia pair well with its groovy Turtle Top color scheme and the fact that this truck still sports its original sheet metal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Going along with the theme of originality, is that this truck still features its original powertrain. This F150 is powered by a 351 V8 engine that sends power to an automatic transmission making for a comfortable yet exciting driving experience. The truck rolls along on its original turbine style wheels that are wrapped around by BF Goodrich all-terrain tires. Another notable feature about the exterior of this truck is that it is the desired short bed configuration with the bed coated in Line-X for durability and is in great shape. Up front the truck wears a bull bar that is outfitted with a pair of fog lights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moving inside, this truck\u2019s original shag carpet interior pairs well with the Turtle Top exterior, which really completes this truck\u2019s nostalgic look and really makes you feel like you are back in the 70\u2019s when driving this vehicle around. Other cool features inside the truck are a Cobra CB radio, tilt wheel, and air conditioning. The headliner and carpeting are in great shape and the seats are overall in pretty good shape with some signs of wear and tear that is expected from an over 40-year-old vehicle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, if you are looking for a truck that will make you feel nostalgic as if you are back in the \u201870\u2019s then this is the truck for you. Its interior and exterior color schemes are representative of the era that it is from, and the truck sports most of its original components. To bring it all together this truck features different pieces of memorabilia that are exemplary of the time it is from including its inspection and club stickers as well as its CB radio. Classic vehicles of all sorts have the ability to bring us back to a simpler time and this vehicle is surely one that will do that for you.\n",

        "description": "1947 Oldsmobile Series 68 Special Convertible\nStunning, restored 1947 Oldsmobile Series 68 Special Convertible for Sale. Purchased by its current owner in 2007 who shortly thereafter embarked on an exhaustive nut/bolt, frame-off, rotisserie restoration. It is beautifully re-finished in its original Caspain Blue (74) with a proper tan leather and cloth interior, tan cloth top & boot cover with just 4,000 miles since the odometer was reset after its complete restoration. It comes equipped with the 257ci Inline-Eight and a Hydra-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission and includes a large cache of records, books & manuals, and a clean California title. \u00a0\nThe exterior was fully disassembled, the body removed from the frame along with doors, hood, and trunk, fully stripped, and painted to the highest standards in single-stage Caspain Blue on a rotisserie. The finish is smooth as glass including the body, jambs, and undercarriage and the alignments and fitment are outstanding. The chrome was replated, trim polished, lenses refreshed and all rubber replaced. The new top was reinstalled onto a fully restored frame and fits beautifully. The 15\" steel rims were finished in classic red and wear correct trim rings and hubcaps and are wrapped in 7.00-15 Firestone Deluxe Champion whitewall tires. Even the frame and undercarriage components have been professionally powder-coated. The car maintains a stunning appearance and looks nearly new.\nThe interior is immaculate with new two-tone leather & cloth seating, door panels, cards, and matching rugs with tan piping. It has a lovely refinished woodgrain dashboard, a working AM radio along with fully operational lighting, the proper 6-volt system with new wiring, a working clock and wipers, rebuilt power top, and all working gauges (with the exception of the fuel gauge). It is a very comfortable example even for the longest drives.\n257ci Inline-Eight was fully rebuilt, it starts easily, runs cool, and idles quietly and smoothly. The rebuilt Hydra-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission shifts at all of the proper shift points and the restored braking and suspension work as designed. New bushings, mounts, and suspension all make for a factory-new driving experience for this exquisitely restored classic Oldsmobile.\nThis is a great opportunity to own a truly investment-grade vintage Oldsmobile, a classic piece of American history that is ready for its next 76 years!

        "year": "1972",
        "description": "- Chassis # 101AC101147745\nFor two short years in 1971 and 1972, Ferrari produced the 365 GTC/4, a 2+2 grand tourer based on the chassis and drivetrain of the 365 GTB/4 \u201cDaytona\u201d. Under the hood was a 4.4 L Tipo F 101 AC 000 Colombo V12 engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission that put out 335 hp. Rather than a transaxle setup like the Daytona, the 5-speed transmission was bolted directly to the engine, giving the 365 GTC/4 a near-perfect 51:49 weight distribution.\nUS export models received three-point seat belts, side markers, and numerous engine modifications to comply with Federal emission standards, including air injection, a carbon, and a different exhaust system which lowered the engine output to 316 hp. Only 505 examples were built over the car\u2019s two-year production span.\nToday, the GTC/4 stands as the more elegant and manageable younger sibling of the infamous Daytona. With a dramatically more street-worthy nature, the GTC/4 has the looks of the much pricier Daytona while being far more pleasant and comfortable to use on a daily basis. Pricing on the GTC/4 has been very solid over the last 5 years while continually trending in a positive direction. Having driven both extensively, we feel that the GTC/4 is overall undervalued given the fantastic V12 experience it provides in addition to its timeless good looks, and we see ample room for increased future value.\nThis particular example, 101AC101147745, was delivered in 1971 to its initial owner in Crepaldi, Italy, finished in metallic blue with a tan leather interior. It was later transported to the US, where it was offered for sale by Ferrari of Los Gatos in Los Gatos, CA, in 1978 and again in 1988 with a reported 18,875 miles on the odometer.\nThe car was then purchased by a new owner out of New York and repainted black, and later that same year, it was yet again offered for sale by Berlinetta Motorcars in Huntington Station, NY. Two years later, in 1990, the Ferrari was offered for sale by Tim Stanford Foreign Cars out of Fort Lauderdale, FL, with a reported 19,500 miles on the odometer. It remained in Florida for the next three years, where it was offered for sale by the same owner in 1991, 1992, and 1993 before it eventually exchanged hands in 1993 with 19,847 miles on the odometer.\nFollowing a six-year ownership in Miami, FL, this GTC/4 was offered for sale in 1999 to a fellow Floridian who owned the car for the next seven years. It made its way to Motorcar Gallery in Fort Lauderdale, FL, on July 2006 and was reportedly freshly serviced before being listed. It was purchased in August by it\u2019s next owner out of Mars, PA, who continued owning the car for the next five years.\nThe Ferrari made its rounds on eBay in late 2011 and early 2012. It was described as having undergone a bare metal Rosso Cordoba respray with a new Interior, re-chromed trim, engine detail, freshened camshaft by Web Cam Inc, rebuilt carburetors, starter, alternator, AC system, and brake booster. Sometime in mid to late 2012, it was purchased by its next owner out of Charlotte, NC, which is when the service records on file begin.\nThroughout this ownership, the car was mostly serviced at Automotive International of Charlotte, NC. In August of 2012, it received a brake system flush, cleaned wiper assembly, as well as some minor interior electrical repairs. It returned in October of the same year for further minor services that included an inoperative heat fan and a broken fuel enrichment system. A new window switch and lighter plug were installed along with new headlamps in August of 2013 by the same shop. A new ignition coil was installed in June 2014 to correct an intermittent ignition issue, and new engine mounts were also installed.\nThe passenger wiper was repaired in March of 2015 due to a broken wiper arm post shaft, the voltage regulator was rebuilt, and the rear right wheel bearing was replaced. In May of 2015, new ignition boxes were installed along with the corresponding wiring and ignition coils. A couple of small holes in an exhaust were repaired as well.\nThe car would exchange hands again in 2018, where it ended up with its current owner and consignor, who is a good friend and enthusiast. Being very knowledgeable about the workings of cars, he completed a number of maintenance items on his own, which included having the brake booster and master cylinder rebuilt, replacing the spark plug wires with factory-correct ones, replacing the fuel and vacuum hoses, balancing and tuning the carbs, and replacing the fluids and oil in 2020 then again in 2022\nAs it sits, this is a well-sorted and very correct example of one of Ferrari\u2019s most underrated V12 grand touring machines. High-speed and long-distance driving are what this car was built for, and its lengthy service history will allow its future owner to enjoy it to its full potential.\nUpon purchase, the new owner will receive the original toolkit, owner\u2019s manual, and all service and history records on file. In addition, we are working on getting a Massini report for the car, which will be uploaded to the listing and included in the sale as well.\nPlease visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

This Impala retains all of its original body panels and was accident free with original paint still on the car before its comprehensive restoration started in 2005.\n\u00a0The car was stripped to bare metal and put on a rotisserie for repaint to show quality standard in its original color of Honduras Maroon. Extra care was taken to clean the car before stripping to uncover factory stencil and paint markings so that they could be replicated after paint. All gaps are extremely good and body panels are straight, paint is fully sanded and buffed. The undercarriage has the correct oxide sealer finish and the trunk is spatter painted as original.\u00a0\n\u00a0 The interior was restored in the cars correct Fawn color with factory correct materials throughout. All gauges were rebuilt or replaced and all function properly. The factory original Sun Tach is mounted on the column. The AM radio works as do the wipers, blinkers, etc. This is a very well sorted car.\u00a0\n\u00a0 The original 409 engine was fully balanced and rebuilt with forged TRW 11.1 pistons and upgraded stainless valves. In 2017 the next owner after restoration upgraded the cam to a Comp Cams 48-000-5 and added roller rockers, HD springs, and titanium locks and retainers to strengthen the top end. Bob Ream rebuilt the Date code correct original Carburetors in 2018. This car runs Flawlessly, starts right up cold and idles immediately dropping RPM\u2019s as it comes off the choke just like it did when new. Sounds tame through the factory NOS exhaust system with mufflers and resonators but don\u2019t be fooled this 409 burns rubber all through first when floored and rips right up to 6000 RPM QUICK! The factory Correct Borg Warner aluminum T-10 4 speed was rebuilt and shifts perfectly. Out back the original 3.08 Posi Traction rear differential was rebuilt as well. The car has correct NOS spiral shocks that are dated for the car but the fronts have been replaced with Bilsteins for ride improvement. Original NOS front shocks accompany the car as does the Original Cam, rocker arms, etc. The pictures show Additional parts included as well as Date code and part # list of all major mechanical parts on this car.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0You would be hard Pressed to find a nicer example at any price. In 2011 the car was awarded at the VCCA national event in Flint Michigan. No awards accompany the car as they were retained by the restorer. The car comes with a stack of receipts, restoration photos, assembly manual, its original keys, and other documents.\u00a0\nWorldwide shipping available, please email me for a Quote.\n",

        "description": "Harley-Davidson released the Shovelhead with the 1966 Electra Glide. It boasted an aluminum head with a different shaped combustion chamber and rocker arms attached to the rocker cover instead of to the head itself. The Electra Glide was a serious long distance tourer with a top speed just under 100 mph. A front disc brake was a welcome addition in 1972 and even at a hefty 738lbs the quarter mile time was a decent 15.42 seconds. The first Classic FLH appeared in 1977. This particular example has 20,474 original miles and has been completely gone through within the last 4 years and 4,000 miles. The engine was completely rebuilt during which time it was bored .030 over. During the same time it received all new lines and cables. It was repainted in a gorgeous Metallic Green about 10 years ago and it still shows great. Within the last 2 years it received new spoked wheels with wide whitewalls, new chrome 12\u201d bars, new brake calipers and rotors, new fork seals, new bearings and a variety of new chrome covers. It is fed via an S&S carb and it sounds incredible ripping through its newer performance exhaust. It has been serviced every 1,000 miles since being rebuilt and everything is working as it should. In the last 4 years close to $15k has been spent on rebuilding and reconditioning this beauty yet we are barely asking half of that. It is priced fairly so if you like this bike reach out before someone else beats you to it!\n",

It starts and runs smoothly with excellent oil pressure and plenty of power. Shifting is smooth though the gears and the suspension and braking feel good.\nThe exterior is complete, the body has been primed over its original paint, is mostly straight, and should be a fairly easy restoration. The floors are solid except for some minor degradation in the driver's foot-well area. The pop-top goes up and down and the tent is usable as-is. The windows open and shut fine and the screens (not shown) are included.\nInside is mostly complete though showing its age. The windows roll up and down easily, and the heater is in working order along with the wipers, horn, and exterior lighting though the speedometer and RMP gauges have stopped working. We are taking a look at that and should be able to address it.\nThis is an honest, nice-driving California bus that could be enjoyed as-is or driven while restoring.

        "description": "Rust Free Vehicle from Out West | Fuel Injected 4.2L 6 Cylinder Engine | 5-Speed Manual Transmission | Stock Ride Height w/ 31\u201d A/T Tires | Custom Seats & Locking Center Console | Hard Top & Doors | Comprehensively Restored\n\u00a0\nThere may be no other more recognizable American front end than the Jeep. Originally built for World War II, the Jeep has always been built with ruggedness in mind to go over any terrain. Over the decades there have been many generations, but the overall boxy look has mainly stayed the same. This rings true for the Civilian Jeeps or more commonly known as CJ\u2019s. The CJ-7 was produced from 1976-1986, and it is a good mix between the iconic Jeep look and the overall rounded and curvy design of many cars from the 70\u2019s.\nThis 1984 example is representative of that design and is in beautiful stock condition. Hailing from out west, this vehicle has spent most of its life out in California and Nevada, which can help explain why this vehicle is so clean. Along with that, this vehicle has been comprehensively restored. Finished in a beautiful blue this color pairs well with the Laredo decals that run along the body of the vehicle. This Jeep also comes with a removable black hardtop that has also been refinished.\nThis CJ is powered by a fuel injected 4.2L inline 6-cylinder engine that drives power to a 5-speed manual Borg-Warner T5 transmission. The vehicle sits at stock ride height and wears factory CJ-7 wheels that are wrapped around by 31\u201d Toyo Open Country all-terrain tires. A matching spare wheel and tire sits on the tailgate. This vehicle\u2019s stock condition makes it easy to drive and the fuel injected engine paired with 5-speed manual transmission gives you a simple and reliable yet fun driving experience.\nMoving to the interior, one will see a pair of front bucket seats separated by a locking center console. Sitting in front of the gear and transfer case shifter are a few different gauges. On the floor are a pair of Bestop floor mats, and out back is a nice bench seat for two. This simple interior is commonplace among Jeeps from this era.\nThis vehicle is perfect for someone who is looking to buy a stock Jeep CJ in excellent condition. Its beautiful blue exterior pairs well with the Laredo badging that fit the body lines of this CJ well, and its stock condition makes this Jeep fun and simple to drive.

        "description": "Details\nThis sympathetically restored 1971 Porsche 911T Targa is a fine example of the early long hood cars. It is powered by a 2.2L flat-six engine that sends power to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle. A bright shade of green covers the exterior, and it is contrasted with beige leather upholstery and black carpets. The car is equipped with Zenith carburetors, head restraints, a collapsable Targa roof panel, fog lamps, and a new AC system from Straat. This well-documented vehicle has been under the same ownership since 2016 and received a restoration in 2021. The car's five-digit odometer reads 69,743 miles, but the total mileage is unknown. It is located in Miami, Florida.\nThe recent restoration of the interior and re-paint of the exterior of this 911 show well in the third-party photographs and inspection. The car's green paint is in excellent condition after a glass out respray of the original color. The car retains its original sheet metal. The re-trimmed interior carpets and upholstery are without blemish, and the dash is without cracks. The new AC system is reported to work as designed, and the sound system functions as it should. Mechanically, the car is sound, thanks to a mechanical restoration by Klub Sport Racing in 2016. Recent receipts show service to the shifter and carburetors to ensure the car is running as intended. Included in the sale of the vehicle is a detailed log of repairs, oil changes, fuel refills, and tire purchases from the original owner dating from 1971-1986. Additional information about, and receipts from the recent restoration performed by Carparc in California are also included. The tool kit, jack, owner's manual, and spare tire are also still with the car.\u00a0\nThis Porsche 911 is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Miami, FL.\nAbout the model\nThe Targa version of the 1971 Porsche 911T 2.2 Liter was introduced in 1970. These semi-convertible sports cars were powered by a 2.2L naturally aspirated flat-six engine that sent 125hp to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual or 4-speed semi-automatic transmission. In production until 1971, the Porsche 911T 2.2 Liter Targa was replaced by the Porsche 911T 2.4 Liter.\nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nOwnership History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n",

Before that, you had two beautiful convertibles: the 190SL and the 300SL Gullwing.\nThe result is a beautiful design without any fuss. The roof was given a safe \u2018roll-proof\u2019 construction that rose at the sides. With this design, it was somewhat akin to an Oriental building; a Pagoda. Voila, a \u2018spitz name\u2019 was born for this beautiful SL, and later became a legend. Design and engineering came together in a cruiser that screamed to cruise around elegantly in a timeless classic.\nYou know us a bit by now, and know that we are always looking for something nice, something extra. Ours is an original American-made manual transmission Mercedes 250 SL. This one has been neatly restored and fully documented, just the way you want it!\nWe ourselves are still amazed at how modern this \u2018Sixties-Lovely\u2019 drives. Are you looking for a good investment, a lovely classic cruiser, or both? Come by soon, and let\u2019s go for a drive!\n",

        "description": "1969 Corvette L71 427/435 Yellow Yenko Delivery\nFor 1969 Cheverlot refined the new C3 1968 model with changes that increased horsepower as well as fixing small things that were irritating to customers. One important update was the ladder-type, steel-reinforced frame was \u201cstiffened\u201d in an effort to reduce body shake and vibration.\u00a0 A second was a production tooling change that opened up the inner door panels a half-inch per side, allowing occupants additional shoulder space. \u00a0 The base engine became the 300 horsepower 350 cubic inch V-8. \u00a0 Near the top of the optional engine list was the L71 427.\u00a0 A $290.40 upgrade that got you 435 horsepower with triple holley carburetors. The only higher up the chain a buyer could go was the L88/L89 engines intended for racing.\nMost people associate the name Yenko with the 427 Camaro/SCs, 427 Chevelle/SCs, and 427 Nova/SCs, but the Canonsburg, Pennsylvania's Yenko Chevrolet was very proud to be the Greater Pittsburgh area's only \"authorized\" High Performance Corvette dealer back in the late 60s. Throughout the 1960s, Don and Frank Yenko routinely ran ads in the Pittsburgh Press proudly announcing \"Buy Your Corvette at Yenko Corvette Center,\" and they sold a lot of performance Corvettes.\u00a0 This very special car was one of those.\nA copy of the tank sticker on file verifies other important details about this car. Built in March 1969, this highly original Daytona Yellow 1969 Corvette is one of 2,722 produced with the L71 427/435 HP Tri-Power engine, in this case mated to a 4-speed manual transmission and optional 4.11:1 gearing to draw full peak horsepower from the big-block V-8. At just more than 40,000 original miles, it retains most of its original Daytona Yellow paint and the original black interior complete with tilt-telescopic steering column, tinted glass and Delco AM/FM radio. Proudly displaying Yenko badges on the hood and tail panel, it retains its transistor ignition, chrome luggage rack, bright fender louver trim and Rally wheels with Whitewall tires.\nA very original car with lots of unique details.\u00a0 For example, the correct Tri-Power Smog Pump which was an exclusive to the Tri-Power cars. Original clear tape on the headlight wiring loom-the vacuum headlights and parking lights all function like new-having the correct black paint \"cut line\" in the engine compartment at the firewall tip of each fender.\u00a0 Also the original NOS F70x15-inch Firestone white striped bias ply tires, 15x8-inch Rally wheels, four-clip beauty rings and correct hubcaps all point to this car being totally original.\nHistorically, this Corvette L71 has \"been seen around\" the Greater Pittsburgh area for most of its fifty years.\u00a0 In 1981 it was owned by Harry Statowitz in indianola. By the early 2000s it was in the hands of Larry Tenorovich.\u00a0 In 2006 it was purchased by a New Florence, Pennsylvania, Corvette collector named Bob Priest.\u00a0 Priest had performed a basic engine rebuild on the original date code (\"LT\") 427 big-block, 4.251-inch bore and 3.76-inch stroke, and cast-iron square-port \"L71\" big-block cylinder heads, using the original stock GM components. \u00a0 In late 2007 Brian Henderson bought the car.\u00a0 A Pennsylvania native, Brian \u00a0is co-owner of one of the most successful muscle car restoration shops in the country, Latrobe, Pennsylvania's Super Car Workshop.\u00a0 The car was purchased by the current owner in 2016.\nThe car has recently been sorted and its triple Holley 2 barrels have been rebuilt and tuned.\u00a0\u00a0 It represents a very rare opportunity to purchase a documented Yenko delivered L71 427/435 Corvette in outstanding original condition.\n",

        "description": "Details\nThis early 1965 \u201cD\u201d code Ford Mustang is powered by a 289ci V8 and backed by a three-speed C4 transmission that sends power to the rear wheels. This pony car is painted in the factory-correct Prairie Bronze and complemented by the Palomino beige vinyl interior. Additional factory features include a set of Rally Pac gauges, convertible top, power brakes, 3.00:1 rear-end gears, A/C, and a period-correct radio. This early 1965 Mustang still uses the original style generator and appears to have early-style body panels unique to this era. The original speedometer, glove box door, air cleaner, and valve cover have all been swapped out in favor of newer parts to improve functionality. The odometer reads 70,608 miles, but the true mileage is unknown. This Mustang is located in California.\u00a0\nThe third-party photos and inspection show a well-cared-for Mustang. The gold-colored exterior is in good condition, with minor chips, and the interior shows only minor wear to the dash, inner door panels, and the headliner. The car is said to be in good operating condition, including a new convertible top window. Included in the sale is a full-size spare and one set of keys.\n\u00a0\nThis Mustang is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Newbury Park, CA.\n\u00a0\nAbout the model\nThe first generation Ford Mustang was built in one of three body styles; hardtop (notchback), fastback, or convertible. The Ford Mustang was first launched as an unofficial 1964-1/2 model. These \"1964-1/2\" Mustangs were available with an inline six, a 260 cubic inch V8, or the 289 cubic inch V8. Upon the 1965 Mustang's official introduction, new engines became available. Depending on the engine used, these cars were available with a 3-speed manual, a 4-speed manual, or a 3-speed automatic transmission, all of which sent drive to the rear wheels. For the 1967 model year, Ford updated the Mustang, which resulted in the 1967-1968 First Generation Ford Mustang.\u00a0\nFeatures and Specs\nKnown Modifications\nService History\nOwnership History\nKnown issues\nDue Diligence\nIncluded in the sale\n",

        "description": "For the 1955 model year, Ford introduced its answer to Chevrolet's Corvette, the Thunderbird, or the \"T-Bird\" as it has become known as today. Featuring an all metal body and V-8 engine, unlike Chevrolets 6 cylinder fiberglass Corvette, the T-Bird was built for sporty good looks, but also for comfort. For the 1957 model year, Thunderbird sales increased dramatically with an all new cosmetic design and performance options. Featuring an extended tail end by 6 inches, a new grille and bumpers, the 1957 T-Bird is considered by many to be the most beautiful of all the two seat Thunderbirds. Mechanically, you were able to upgrade the performance by ordering either the E-Code or F-Code engines. The E-Code is an incredible and very rare option increasing the horsepower by a lot. The E-Code features dual four barrel Holley carburetors, increased bore and stroke, higher compression ratio and automatic choke giving the 312 cubic inch Ford Y-Block V-8 enough horsepower to beat Chevrolets fuel injected 283 V-8 by just 2 horsepower. Furthermore buyers were also able to order the performance engines with the optional 3 speed manual transmission and even further overdrive was available for an additional cost. A true performance sports car, the E-Code is one of the coolest 1950's American sports cars ever made.\nOffered here is one of the finest and rarest examples of an original 1957 Ford Thunderbird \"E-Code\" that exists today. Owned by a gentleman here in Connecticut for many many years, this E-Bird has been cherished and very well taken care of. Besides being a true E-Code with the high performance \"dual quad\" engine, this E-Code is equipped with its original factory 3 speed manual transmission with factory overdrive! This is a true unicorn among Thunderbirds. On top of being such a rare bird, the restoration is wonderful having had a body off restoration some years ago with all the right details down to the firewall stampings and proper radiator hoses. Currently the car wears period chrome wire wheels and original skirts, but it also comes with its factory original steel wheels and \"dog dish\" hubcaps found only on true performance Birds. Mechanically it runs and drives incredibly well and is ready for the open road or car shows this coming spring. Contact us today for more information.\n",

        "description": "1955 Jaguar XK140 MC OTS Roadster\n\nChassis no. S810902DN\nThe Jaguar XK140 was a natural evolution of the famous XK120. Introduced in 1954 at Earl\u2019s Court Motor show, the XK140 incorporated a number of changes and improvements to the earlier model.\u00a0Most significantly was increased legroom and higher standard horsepower at 190, with 210 available with fitment of the optional C-Type racing head.\nThere were three different versions of the XK140. Standard cars with the 190 HP engine, single exhaust systems, disc wheels, and rear wheel covers.\u00a0Next came the \u201cSpecial Equipment\u201d or SE models\u00a0with the same engine, but with full dual exhaust system and knock off wire wheels. Also included were twin fog lamps and windshield washers. In the United States, this version was known as the 140M. Finally, the highest-specification SE model equipped with the C-Type head which became known as the XK140MC, as distinguished by an \u201cS\u201d prefix in their chassis numbers. Further, those cars equipped with the optional C-Type head were fitted with a plaque mounted on the passenger side dash, proclaiming that car as a replica of the car that had achieved 141 MPH at Le Mans.\nIn a short production window of slightly more than 2 years a total of 8,936 chassis were built in all performance variations, and made available with three different body styles. First was the DHC (drophead coupe) with roll-up windows and jump seats; next was the FHC (Fixed Head Coupe); and last was the OTS (Open Two Seat Roadster), such as the car offered here, which had no exterior door handles or windows. Open Two Seat Roadster bodies were mounted on approximately 30% of the chassis.\nThe car presented here is the most desirable version of the XK140. As verified by its JDHT Heritage Certificate it is a true XK140MC OTS Roadster, the highest-specification offered with the more desirable and sporting coachwork. Originally delivered through Max Hoffman of New York in February 1955. It is offered from a 51-year ownership, having been purchased in July 1972 from Richard Willard of Leominster Massachusetts by the current owner\u2019s husband as a Mother\u2019s Day gift. The car was driven regularly as a summer car through the 70s, 80 and 90s, and in 2010 the owner made the decision to change the factory colors of black with red interior to the current blue on blue which displays quite well. Currently fitted with a replacement engine A62778 with \u201cC\u201d Type head G2934-8S.\u00a0 However, most importantly the original, rebuildable \u201cC\u201d head is included in the sale of the car. It is fitted with its original identification plate and body number tag.\nAlso installed on the car are chrome XKE wheels which were an aesthetic decision by the current owner; the original XK140 painted spoke wheels are also included in the sale. Recent sorting includes a tune up, brake job, fluid change and over 400 miles of driving. This car additionally comes with a soft top, tonneau cover, side curtains, owner\u2019s manual, shop manuals, and a complete set of documentation including the aforementioned Heritage Certificate as well as invoices spanning over 50 years of ownership.\n",

We can see a lot of recent service work done...new alternator and fuel pump, new windshield rubber seals and compression strip, new brake calipers, pads and shoes, new brake flex lines, some new metal lines, and a new battery and coil.\nTop is very good, tonneau appears to be new, carpets and dash are all in very good condition as are interior panels and seats.\nWiring looks like it has never been cut into, radiator fins are excellent as is the original cardboard radiator shroud. All signs of a properly serviced, cared for classic sports car.\nAs for the rest....lots of smooth power and torque from the 2.5 liter six cylinder engine, power assist disc brakes, the IRS offers a better ride than most other period sports cars, roomy, comfortable, ample trunk space (spare wheel is in its own compartment under the trunk floor,), and even has its original (working) AM-FM radio. Amazing, ORIGINAL radio!\nLarge diameter wheels/tires and high gearing offer comfortable highway cruising and these cars are perfect for either around town, country roads, or long distance touring. Reliable, easy to service and maintain, parts are widely available and easily accessed, and if you like the style of TRs, you will certainly enjoy this fifty two year old classic British sports car. And if you desire a racing style, we can install Minilite style alloy wheels and if you prefer a more traditional look, converting to wire wheels is easy.\n",

        "description": "HIGHLIGHTS\nOPTIONS INCLUDE:\nThe year 1974 marked a watershed year for the Porsche 911 as it was the first year of the new G series, which introduced a strengthened chassis to meet tough new US safety standards. The inner structure of the tub was reinforced, new \u201cimpact\u201d bumpers with shock absorbers were integrated front and rear for a smooth appearance, a new \u201cshort-hood\u201d look was introduced, and the doors received new internal bracing to improve side-impact resistance. The revised front trunk space now contained a single battery and a collapsible spare tire nestled over its 21-gallon fuel tank.\nThe magnificent 1974 Porsche 911 Carrera 2.7 coupe featured here is finished in highly desirable Black with rare Gold graphics over Black. This exquisite motorcar is been meticulously maintained and is among one of the finest examples we have offered in years. This 911 still retains its original engine and transmission, which, in combination with its factory color combination, makes this the perfect example to add to any premier collection. I personally believe the investment potential of this rare limited production Carrera will grow beyond your imagination offered to the most demanding collector, investor, or enthusiast who aspires to own one of the very best!\n",

        "description": "Please note our prices are in Euro's and reading KM\nJaguar: it is more than just a car you buy, it is a sign of respect you own.\nRegarding the Jaguar XK150, the successor to both the XK120 and the XK140, the type name referred to the car's top speed in miles per hour. Although the XK150 fell just short of that speed, at the time it was one of the fastest production cars in the world at an impressive 135 miles per hour. Despite this minor disappointment, these cars remain absolutely stunning!\nThe XK150 is distinguished from its predecessors by the curved windscreen, which is now a single piece instead of a split window. In addition, the grille in the nose is slightly wider and the windscreen has been moved back slightly, giving the nose an even more imposing look.\nOur XK150 underwent a thorough restoration in 2002, so the car is currently in excellent condition. The beige interior evokes associations with the seats in the back rooms of Windsor Castle, and in harmony with the deep dark blue exterior, this example really makes a statement on the road. Owning a classic car like the Jaguar XK150 is a source of pride and joy for enthusiasts who appreciate the craftsmanship and attention to detail behind its creation. Whether you are looking for a solid investment or just want to experience the excitement of driving a true classic, the Jaguar XK150 undoubtedly deserves your attention.\nWhat makes our example special? Apart from its aesthetic features, this XK150 has also undergone a technical metamorphosis during its restoration. Besides a complete engine overhaul, this British beauty boasts a BMW gearbox, which only further enhances the driving pleasure.\nIn short, an ultimate gentleman sports car ready for many enjoyable miles!\n",

        "description": "- Chassis # 2204412\nThe BMW 2800 CS was the first in a series of coupes produced from 1968 to 1975, internally known as the BMW E9. The Karmann-designed 2800 CS replaced the 2000 C and CS and used a new straight-six engine dubbed the M30. The larger engine required both the wheelbase and the overall length of the car to be increased, yet the car was still lighter and more agile than the series it was replacing, weighing in at 1,420 kg (3,131 lb). The 2.8 L engine put out 168 hp through a 4-speed manual transmission. Only 276 examples of the 2800 CS were produced in 1971 out of a total of 6,283 produced over four years before the E9 range was replaced by the E24 6 Series.\nAs a follow-up to the BMW New Class line, the 2800 CS continued the automaker\u2019s pursuit of creating sporty automobiles while retaining the luxurious feel they had come to be known for. Many of the design cues used on the 2800 CS, like the longer nose and straight-six engine, would become staples of BMW and give the car both a timeless look and modern usability in today\u2019s traffic environment.\nToday, the 2800CS remains highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike. Thanks to their low production numbers, timeless good looks, and a high degree of useability, they have garnered a fantastic following in the collector car community. Pricing over the past 5 years has been steady with a general upward trend. We see these cars as solid investments, not very likely to pop in value but also highly unlikely to lose any value as well. They present a fantastic opportunity to purchase and use the car as intended while retaining the money invested. As is the case with any collector car, finding an example with great history and non-traditional colors is always the safest bet.\nThis particular example, Chassis # 2204412, is an extremely original example that was owned and lovingly preserved by the same family for over 50 years.\nIn that time, it has retained its original engine, much of its original paint, and all of its matching interior. It shows incredible indicators of originality, including factory stickers, inspection markings, and clamps. It was purchased new by Mr. Falk from Autos-Import S.A. of Geneva, Switzerland, in 1971 with a \u201cSahara\u201d paint job and a tan woolen interior with corduroy cloth inserts. Original equipment includes power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, a rear-window defroster, and a Blaupunkt radio. The original owner passed away a short two years after purchasing the car, upon which it was passed down to his son.\nThe son continued to own and meticulously maintain the car throughout the years, often at the same dealer it was purchased from. In 1996, the BMW was imported stateside through American Lamprecht, Inc. in Lawrence, NY, and was appraised in July of that same year by a company in Rowayton, CT, with just 41,466 kilometers (25,765 miles) on the odometer. In 2001 and 2007, it was entered in the Greenwich Concours d\u2019Elegance and won best in class in the 2001 show.\nThe meticulous service records continued, with the front brake calipers having been rebuilt in 2012 at La Jolla Independent BMW Service of La Jolla, CA. After 48 years of ownership, the son listed the BMW for sale on Bring a Trailer, where it was purchased by our client and current consignor.\nServices under its new owner began in 2021 with a new tailpipe installed at European Auto Center Repair in Norwalk, CT. In May of 2021, the car underwent a major service at Sports Car Restoration in Plainville, CT, that would last through October of that same year and total almost $20,000. During that time, it received new ignition wires, a new distributor cap, a new rotor, new fuel and coolant hoses, new carburetor chokes, a valve cover gasket, a rebuilt speedometer, odometer, and turn signals, some electric window repairs, and a replacement transmission. The transmission was replaced due to excessive grinding in the original gearbox. A used ZF S5-16 Four-Speed gearbox, in great condition, was sourced and installed, and the original was kept and will be included with the sale of the vehicle. The exterior, interior, underbody, and engine bay were also thoroughly cleaned and degreased during the service and areas at risk of rust were coated in a preventative wax coating.\nIn November of 2022, the car visited Rennsport Automotive in Bedford Hills, NY, for new fluids as well as new spark plugs, distributor points, condenser, cap, and rotor. The valve cover gasket was also replaced alongside new V belts and a power steering filter.\nAs it sits, following the numerous services it underwent in the past two years, this BMW 2800 CS is now a turnkey time-capsule example ready to take on anything from twisty roads to more concour shows. With largely original paint, an incredible original interior, all of the original equipment and accessories, and just ~30,000 original miles on the odometer, this rare German saloon with only one family ownership for 50 years is the pinnacle of automotive preservation.\u00a0\nUpon purchase, the new owner will receive the original purchase agreement, all of the importation documents and service records going back to new, manufacturer\u2019s literature, 1970s first aid kit and roadside assistance kit,\u00a0 tools, spare parts, and upholstery fabric, a GPS unit, a radar detector, and a BMW car cover.\nPlease visit www.LBILimited.com for many more photos and details.

        "description": "- Please note that the price is in euros -\nExcellence on road and rally \u2013 Mercedes 190 SL\nThe Mercedes 190 SL is a perfect example of listening to feedback. After the 300 SL was introduced, an American Mercedes importer noticed that many people were interested, but that the 300 SL was too expensive for what most wanted to spend on a weekend car. After a phone call with Germany, everything accelerated; later that year the 190 SL (based on the Ponton) appeared at the New York show. A year later, the production version was ready in Geneva. Remarkably, not as a sports car, but as a comfortable two-seater. This became a great success, from 1955 to 1963 more than 25.000 cars were produced in Germany.\nOur 190 SL is from 1961, when smoking and ivory were still very normal, and was brought to the Netherlands in 1994. There the car remained in the family until 2019, after which it went to a Dutch collector. This collector decided to thin out his collection and now we were able to add the 190 to ours.\nThe 190 SL is in good condition, and it even participated in the historic Zolder Grand Prix twice. Not for racing, fortunately, because it was never meant for that, but for strolling. If you want to enjoy yourself comfortably in the direction of Italy or just along the beach in the Netherlands without having to participate in every traffic light race, then this is the car for you! You don\u2019t have to prove anything with this car because, 190 SL.\nPure class. Any way you look at it \u2013 Mercedes 190 SL\n",

        "description": "History of the DRAGONSNAKE program:\nDuring the first half of the 1960s, the Cobra achieved motorsport success all over the world. It dominated USRRC and SCCA circuit racing, and was an increasingly persistent thorn in Ferrari\u2019s side in international competition. In 1965, it finally broke the Italian marque\u2019s stranglehold over GT racing by winning the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.\nWith the fearsome acceleration offered by a powerful V8 in a compact chassis, it was even well suited to drag racing. In 1963, a small band of employees persuaded Carroll Shelby to sanction the development of a drag-racing package. Among other upgrades, four stages of tune were offered for the 289ci engine, producing anything from 270hp to 380hp.\nThe famous Dragonsnake was born.\nOnly five factory 289ci Dragonsnakes were built, but other CSX Shelby Cobras were converted to Dragonsnake spec by independent privateers who could buy the package from Shelby when new.\nThe Cobra made to dominate the drag strip did just that in the 1960s\n\u200d\nThe goods:\nThe story goes that after a few employees at Carroll Shelby's small car company created a drag-strip-focused version of the Cobra on their own time, Shelby approved a tiny production run of this quarter-miler called the Dragonsnake. Not legal to drive on the street, they could be ordered from the factory or customers could have their Cobras fitted with Dragonsnake components like a chrome roll bar, new tachometer, revised rear fender flares to fit fat drag slicks on American Racing wheels, and sliding side windows. Only five left the the factory, four fitted with the 289-cubic-inch V8, one got the 427-ci monster.\u00a0\nThe concept car featured here (CSX 2800) is dedicated to drag racer and NHRA champion Bruce Larson, a man the organizing body calls \"NHRA's original triple-threat Pro driver.\" In 1963, Larson drove Jim Costilow's 289 Dragonsnake to class honors at the Winternationals, Springnationals, and Indy U.S. Nationals, setting records throughout the year in the process. Larson took the Nationals again in 1964. Because Larson was working at a Chevrolet dealership when he did this, the dealership owner had Larson in a Chevy by 1966. But the Cobra had proved itself a winning race car in yet another discipline, and would keep claiming trophies into the late sixties.\nThe remaining three continuation Dragonsnakes that we are now offering for sale will start as an aluminum slab-side roadster in the CSX2000 series, meaning based on the original 289-ci chassis. The tube rails are four-inch round units, the engine is a 364-ci V8 with an aluminum block and eight Weber carbs making 500 horsepower, fed by a 14-gallon gas tank and Holley electric fuel pump. It's shifted through a Tremec five-speed manual to spur a car weighing roughly 2,100 pounds. Inside, an 8,000-rpm tach mixes with black leather seats, leather door pulls, a rearview mirror, glove box, custom shift knob, and stainless steel roll bar. Other kit includes an aluminum radiator and electric fan, rack and pinion steering, adjustable Penske shocks, 1963-style disc brakes, a custom exhaust, polished side vents and chrome bumpers, and vintage Cobra badges. The car sits on 15-inch vintage FIA wheels wearing Mickey Thompson tires sized 29 x 4.5 in front, 28 x 10.5 in back.\nEach Dragonsnake costs $750,000 before options. These Dragon Snakes are authenticated by Shelby and built under their guidance with CSX # 's reserved in the SAAC registry for each build.\n",

        "description": "All vehicle trades considered including classics and performance.\u00a0 We can assist with financing and shipping as needed.\nThe 1964 Galaxie 500 R-Code was the most fearsome Ford of the early 1960\u2019s.\u00a0 With a 427ci dual 4-barrel engine rated at 425hp it delivered the most powerful engine of its day.\u00a0 Think about it; back then you could walk into a Ford dealer and essentially buy the same car that was cleaning up in NASCAR, albeit with a street version of the legendary 427. \u00a0And while the Galaxie was a huge success with millions produced, only a few thousand R-codes were ever built, making them very rare today.\u00a0 This offering provides a unique opportunity to own one of these remarkable cars with its original, rebuilt engine.\nThis Galaxie shows 40k miles and is the beneficiary of a recent refurbishment that included a 2016 trim-off repaint in its original Wimbledon White.\u00a0 It is a great color for the attractive 1964 styling with its fastback style roof and sleek, subdued trim. \u00a0The sheetmetal all looks straight without any signs of past trauma, and the floors are original throughout.\u00a0 The original door tag is also present and shows a production date of 10-10-63 making it a fairly early build.\u00a0 All of the chrome and trim is in good condition right down to those meaningful \u201c427\u201d emblems on the fenders.\u00a0 The 15\u201d steel wheels wear General tires from 2016.\u00a0 Note the Ford hub caps are included; we just thought it looked meaner without them.\nWhile the exterior of this Galaxie may draw its share of looks, the engine compartment is truly captivating.\u00a0 There sits the car\u2019s original dual quad 427ci R-code which was factory rated at 425 hp and 480 ft-lbs.\u00a0 While Ford did not VIN stamp engines until 1968, this one shows the correct C4AE 6015-A casting number and a proper 3K1 (10-1-63) casting date.\u00a0 The engine was fully rebuilt and has roughly 500 miles since completion.\u00a0 Note the engine block did not require an overbore or sleeves.\u00a0 The cylinder heads are the correct C3AE 6090-J castings and are mated to Ford\u2019s impressive cast iron headers.\u00a0 The intake manifold, dual Holley carburetors, and air cleaner were all replaced though the original pieces are included.\u00a0 Same with the alternator.\nThe transmission appears to be the original T10 4-speed based on date codes (like the engine, no VIN stamps were applied until years later).\u00a0 Note the T10 is correct for early 1964 Galaxies; later builds received the new-for-64 Toploader.\u00a0 The transmission was also rebuilt so it shifts properly and stays in gear.\u00a0 The 9\u201d rear end is also believed original and came from the factory with 3.50 gears and an open differential.\u00a0 As an R-code, brakes and steering are manual which keeps things fast, light, and simple.\u00a0 All mechanical systems are in good operating condition with many new parts throughout.\nThe code 75 red interior is mostly original and looks terrific for its age.\u00a0 There is a split bench seat in front and another bench seat in back that offers plenty of legroom.\u00a0 Note there are no seat belts.\u00a0 The carpet has been replaced and a new headliner was professionally installed.\u00a0 The dash is simple and straightforward with instruments limited to a speedometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge.\u00a0 An aftermarket oil pressure gauge has been installed along with a T-handle Hurst shifter. \u00a0The headlights, dash lights, turn signals, backup lights, horn, wipers, courtesy lights, and parking brake all work properly.\u00a0 So do the heater / defroster and factory AM radio.\u00a0 The cavernous trunk contains what may be an original spare tire and bumper jack.\nThis R-code is more than just a rare classic car.\u00a0 It\u2019s a piece of history from the birth of the horsepower wars, when \u201cwin on Sunday, sell on Monday\u201d really meant something.\u00a0 This big Galaxie is also great fun to drive, offering an experience completely unlike anything today.\u00a0 \u00a0These cars don\u2019t show up on the market very often, especially in this condition and with an original drivetrain. \u00a0And while other \u201964 R-codes have sold well into six figures, this one presents as a relative bargain.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

The rest of the sheet metal is excellent including the floor and the trunk floor.\nThe body is really straight and dent free and the chrome is probably the best chrome you will find on an unrestored 1960 Cadillac!\nI have gone through the car like you have to do with cars that have been sitting for a long time.\nRebuilt brakes inc master cylinder, wheel cylinders, hoses etc.\nNew water pump and all heater hoses\nFlushed out radiator, new thermostat and new radiator hoses.\nNew fuel pump and fuel hoses.\nBoiled out fuel tank and all fuel lines cleaned.\nNew battery.\nNew complete interior and the seats were stripped down to the springs. New headliner, carpet, seats, kick panels, package tray and side panels. Door panels were so nice they did not need work.\nPower window mechanism in all doors was lubed and greased and also the door locks.\n4 new www radial tires\nNew dual exhaust with Flowmaster mufflers\nEngine service with lubed lifters, rocker arms, lubed cylinders before starting up the engine. New engine oil and filter\nRebuilt carburetor\nI replaced 2 cracked side windows and all glass is good.\nThe Cadillac runs and drives, 2 door panels still needs to be installed after the interior job was finished and a few interior trim pieces, all there but needs install.\nThe 1957 Cad hubcaps are not on the car anymore but it comes with a set of 1959 Cadillac hubcaps.\nI am in the car over $16.000 but need to sell it so $12.000 will buy the Cadillac.\nIt is in Phoenix, Arizona and is sold with a clean Arizona title.\nIf sold on export I can arrange transport to port in Southern California.\n[email\u00a0protected]\n602/931-6000\n",

This stately and elegant Bentley has been restored by world renowned Bentley and Rolls Royce Restorer Richard Gorman @ Vantage Motorworks Miami. After the restoration, Mr. Gorman sold the car to Emir Nasser of Kuwait, who added it to his magnificent car collection. Prior to the Sheiks ownership, this very special Bentley was owned by famous actor Nicholas Cage as part of his storied collection. After the late Sheikhs ownership, Cooper Classics LTD acquired the car and had the restoration refreshed by Automotive Restorations in Stratford Connecticut in 2022. During the refreshening of the restoration, we installed 4 new BF Goodrich Silvertown Whitewall tires. The total mileage is 32,689 Miles. The car appears as new inside and out despite being an older restoration and is ready to be used and enjoyed. It fires right up and everything functions as it should. The Air Conditioning blows ice cold out of the rear compartment as it should. We feel this is likely one of the finest examples in existence, and the only Flying Spur S3 Continental available for purchase at the time of this writing. A similar example was once owned by Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones in less-rare Right Hand Drive spec and was famously known as Blue Lena, which sold for over $1 million at auction. This car comes with all of its tools, including its jack, manual, build sheet, and records.\n",

        "description": "1966 Ford Mustang\nConvertible Project\nfrom\nMustangBeginnings\n\u00a0\nUp for sale\u00a0is an original 1966 Ford Mustang Convertible.\nGood restorable Mustang Convertibles are very hard to find.\nThis Mustang can be restored into an awesome Classic.\u00a0\nIf you have ever wanted a 66 Mustang Convertible project that was affordable, this is the car.\u00a0\u00a0The interior and engine also look to be in good shape. Originally a six cylinder car, with a stick shift, you could keep the car as is, or easily upgrade the suspension to a 5 lug suspension both front and rear.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We would recommend rebuilding the original engine that comes with the car, but you could also consider replacing it with a 289, 302, or even a 351 engine, and either a C-4 automatic or a T-5 manual transmission if you want to be able to spin the tires easily.\u00a0\u00a0Call us if you need a different engine and/or a transmission.\u00a0\u00a0All of the engine/transmission options are available separately at very reasonable prices.\nThe car looks to be an original Blue convertible, but once you do the restoration, it can be repainted to any color of your choice. The original top was Black and, but it will need some restoration to have it functioning properly again. It comes equipped with its original manual transmission, so the clutch pedal is already in place if you decide to upgrade to a T-5 or better.\nThis convertible was beautiful - see pictures of how it could look when fully restored.\nIt brought buyers into the showrooms by the thousands and Ford\u2019s strategy worked\u2014selling more Mustangs than ever before.\nWhen fully restored, this car will easily sell for $30,000 or more.\n\n\nThis car has a good exterior body shell, no accidents, and most all the panels are very straight\u00a0and the quarters are in decent condition.\u00a0 If you have body repair skills, this is a great project.\nThe frame of this Convertible is in fair condition and straight, but it will need new floor pans, rocker channels, torque boxes, and frame rail extensions.\u00a0\u00a0The front frame rails look to be in good condition, which makes it a relatively easy car to restore. Dynacorn now makes a jig welded bottom half for any Mustang convertible which makes restoring convertibles much easier than it used to be.\u00a0\u00a0The convertible top will need to be replaced, and the vinyl window should be changed.\nIf you have questions about how to restore this car, please contact us at MustangBeginnings and we will help all we can to make sure you have a successful restoration.\nOverall this Mustang is a great candidate for restoration.\nINTERIOR:\nAll the wiring, instrument panel, seats, etc. will come with the car but will need to be restored.\u00a0\nThe car comes with all of its seats, both front and back. The door panels and dash pad are included, but you probably want new ones anyway.\n\u00a0\nENGINE BAY:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe car is definitely a project but we can help where you need our help.\u00a0 We can sell you any of the items you may need, like new seat covers, new carpet Etc. Please ask any questions, we know someone will receive a great project and ultimately a great Classic Mustang.\nThe Mustang has a clear title.\u00a0 We will \u00a0supply you with the documents you will need to get the car licensed in your state.\n\u00a0At MustangBeginnings we are here to help you make your restoration a success.\u00a0\nTHERE ARE NO SURPRISES HERE, I ENCOURAGE ALL INTERESTED\u00a0BUYERS TO COME SEE THE CAR FIRST IF POSSIBLE OR SEND SOMEONE HERE TO INSPECT IT. WE HAVE COMPLETED OTHER 66\u00a0MUSTANGS AND KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO COMPLETE THIS CAR. THIS IS A GOOD CAR TO START WITH. PLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS A 66\u00a0MUSTANG THAT NEEDS TO BE REBUILT INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL.\u00a0\n",

The Deluxe chrome trim details and the\u00a0Front Safari windows\u00a0complements the elegant look.\n\u00a0Brand new upholstery in grey, ivory and white trims contrasts with the Blue White cabin and\u00a0delivers a classy feeling. Side panels with thermal/acoustic insulation in the same combinations as the seats, but with chrome trim. Front panel with details in Ivory, and\u00a0new speedometer in miles.\nFully revised mechanics, brakes, transmission and engine ready to go.\nThis vehicle is in transit to Houston, TX port, expected to arrive mid December 23.\n",

        "description": "Supercharged MG MGB Roadster 5-Speed\nThis MG MGB began life as a 1966 MGB GT coupe, and it was acquired by the current owner in 2004 and subsequently fitted with the unibody of a 1978 roadster and further modified with Sebring-style bodywork. A supercharged 1.8-liter inline-four was installed along with a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and the chassis has been fitted with a lowered suspension and four-wheel disc brakes with Wilwood front calipers. The body is finished in yellow and has a black soft top, a louvered hood, fender flares, and triple windshield wipers. Other equipment includes black leather upholstery, 15\u201d alloy wheels, a roll bar, a Moto-Lita steering wheel, burl wood trim, DJ Safety harnesses, and a JVC stereo. This modified MGB is now offered on dealer consignment with build records and photos, magazine articles featuring the car, and a California title listing the vehicle as a 1967 MG coupe.\n\u00a0\nDrivetrain and chassis components from a rusted MGB GT were transferred to a donor roadster body during the aforementioned build, which was conducted under current ownership by On The Road Again Classics of Morgan Hill, California. The car was stripped to bare metal, exterior trim was removed, and Sebring-style front and rear valances, front brake-cooling ducts, and fender flares were added before a repaint in yellow. Additional details include a black soft top, a louvered hood, an enlarged mesh grille, front bumperettes, triple windshield wipers, black side mirrors, red-lens taillights, and a single exhaust outlet. Paint chips and blemishes around the car can be viewed in the photo gallery below.\n\u00a0\nEight-spoke 15\u201d alloy wheels are mounted with 205/50 Falken Azenis tires. The suspension has been lowered and modified with negative front camber, a 7/8\u201d front sway bar, fast road springs, and heavy-duty lever-arm shocks. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with Wilwood four-piston front calipers plus vented rotors up front and Cobra units out back.\n\u00a0\nThe cabin is upholstered in black leather with red piping and is accented with burl wood trim on the dash, center console, and door panels. A roll bar has been added along with a Moto-Lita steering wheel, a JVC AM/FM/cassette stereo, red DJ Safety four-point harnesses, and MG-branded rubber floor mats. The seats have headrests, and HVAC outlets are positioned to the left of the glovebox. The wood on the driver-door armrest is cracked. A battery cutoff switch is located in the trunk.\n\u00a0\nSmiths white-dial instrumentation consists of a 170-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges, while an Innovate Motorsports digital air/fuel mixture display has been added in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 10k miles, which is said to represent the distance added since completion of the build. Total chassis mileage is unknown.\n\u00a0\nThe replacement 1.8-liter inline-four was reportedly overbored .040\u201d and features a nitrided crankshaft, a lightened flywheel, a high-capacity oil sump, a custom camshaft, an aluminum cylinder head, Rimflo valves, roller rocker arms, hardened lifters, a finned valve cover, and Arias forged pistons with an 8.3:1 compression ratio. A supercharger has been added along with a PerTronix electronic ignition system, a cold-air intake, and a heavy-duty radiator with dual electric puller fans. The exhaust headers flow into a stainless-steel resonator, muffler, and finisher.\n\u00a0\nPower is sent to the rear wheels through a T9 five-speed manual transmission and an 8\u201d Ford rear end with a limited-slip differential and 3.5:1 gearing.\n\u00a0\nBuild photos and records are pictured in the gallery along with magazine articles featuring this vehicle.\n\u00a0\nThe chassis plate shown above was installed by the current owner, and the number\u2014GHD3L99429\u2014is consistent with an MGB GT produced in 1966. The VIN listed on the California title bears a \u201c67\u201d prefix, and that document describes the car as a 1967 MGB GT coupe.\n\u00a0\nVisit us at http://www.MohrImports.com for full photo and video collection.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll inspections welcome.

We are proud to present the nicest 356SC Cabriolet that has come through our doors in a very long time. This car benefitted from an extensive, in depth $155K restoration performed by marque specialists Club Sport Racing in Florida, which is documented with each and every invoice for the process.\u00a0 The car was stripped to bare metal and repainted in its factory Red, and the interior was completely reupholstered with new correct materials. The interior presents as new and all the gauges work, including the clock. This is a matching numbers and colors car including both its Certificate of Authenticity and Kardex. This 356SC has perfect panel gaps, and the paint maintains a glass-like mirror finish all around. The black soft top is new and in excellent condition, with a matching black boot cover. The car benefits from a working, modern day radio. The car has driven less than 3500 miles since the restoration and was recently serviced in 2020 including a brake service and a carb tune up. This European spec 356SC starts up with ease and is a joy to drive, thanks to the matching numbers transmission and engine which were both rebuilt during the restoration in 2013-2016. The engine bay is highly detailed with all correct decals and stickers. The underside is so clean you could eat off of it, and the car has absolutely no rust anywhere. We recently re-acquired this 356SC after selling it to a fastidious 356 Collector owner after multiple years of ownership and care. This owner put about 2500 miles on the car, and had the original carburetors rebuilt by the famed 356 Carburetor Rescue, which recently announced the closing of their business. These rebuilt carburetors come in a box with the car, and the set currently installed on the car is in perfect tune. This 356SC is ready to be enjoyed by its new owner and includes Restoration Records, Period Service Records, Tool Kit + Jack, Manuals, Spare Wheel, Top Cover, and service manuals.\n",

This Convertible is an early-production example built September 1965 before Chevrolet downrated the power numbers from 450 to 425 hp. This was believed to have been done for insurance reasons and very few cars received the 450hp designation. This particular Corvette is number 898 produced for 1966. Presented in its original color combination of Laguna Blue over Dark Blue vinyl interior. This car has a straight body with excellent gaps. The paint is show quality with very few flaws. The interior is also in excellent shape with all gauges functioning properly. The clock ticks and the AM/FM radio works. The L72 427 cubic inch engine has been professionally rebuilt with photos documenting the rebuild. When rebuilt, the engine was decked and re-stamped. Photos of the pad before the re-stamp remain with the car. It should also be noted that the date code on the heads is August 26th 1965, the date code on the carburetor is 2nd week August 1965, the date code on the engine block is August 11 1965, and the build date of the car is September 16 1965. It runs perfectly and sounds incredible. The 4 speed Muncie shifts properly and feels good. The undercarriage is in restored condition and looks very clean. The car sits on 15\u201d knock off style wheels with Hankook Optimo radial tires. At the time of restoration, power steering was added.

Dubbed by Enzo Ferrari himself as the \u2018most beautiful car ever built\u2019 this 1967 Jaguar E-Type Series 1 Roadster shows exactly what he meant.\n\u00a0\nPresented in a lovely color combination of Metallic Silver over Black Vinyl interior, this covered headlight example is powered by a 4.2L V-12, which boasts a factory rated 265 horsepower engine and power is sent to the wheels via a Getrag 5-Speed manual transmission. A blue printed and balanced engine under prior ownership sports recent upgrades including an HD radiator, performance cams, stainless steel headers and an exhaust system, giving it a lively driving experience.\n\u00a0\nOther performance features include the 3.31 limited-slip differential and 4-wheel ventilated Wilwood performance disc brakes around the car, while the undercarriage has HD swaybars, performance shocks and a recent detail.\n\u00a0\n15\u201d chrome wire rims are wrapped in Michelin Harmony Radial X tires and secured by two-earned curved knock-off spinners. The brightwork is clear and tightly mounted around the sleek Jaguar body, showing solid gaps and proper mounting hardware to match new gaskets throughout.\n\u00a0\nWithin the interior you will find bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl, black carpeting with Jaguar branded rubber floor mats, a three-spoke wooden steering wheel with a Jaguar center horn button, AM/FM cassette player with dual Apline speakers mounted in the back. Smith\u2019s instrumentation is in center view, showing a 160 MPH speedometer next to a tachometer with complementary clock. Mileage shows 6,796, although true mileage is unknown.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA black soft top affixes nicely when up, with no rips or tears while the matching vinyl tonneau cover neatly keeps it all in place behind the bucket seats. The rear boot is tidy with tan vinyl trim covering a full matching spare and correct jack kit.\n\u00a0\nWell cared for under current ownership within the Carmel Highlands of Carmel By-The-Sea, California, this Jaguar as always been garage or stored in a climate control facility.

        "description": "This 1978 Porsche 930 Turbo was initially delivered to Porsche Audi of Beverley Hills, California, and is said to have remained registered in the state through the current owner\u2019s acquisition in 2005. Now showing 50k miles, the car is finished in Grand Prix White over Cork leather and powered by a turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six linked with a four-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Further equipment includes 16? Fuchs alloy wheels, Bilstein shocks, a front spoiler, a tea tray rear wing, and a European-market exhaust system along with a sunroof and front sport seats. This 930 Turbo is now offered on dealer consignment with a clean California title.\n\u00a0\nThe car is finished in Grand Prix White and features a front spoiler as well as a \u201ctea tray\u201d rear wing. A sunroof, headlight washers, front fog lamps, rear fender stone guards, and a rear window wiper are further details. The selling dealer notes evidence of prior paintwork.\n\u00a0\nStaggered-width 16? Fuchs alloy wheels are mounted with Toyo Proxes T1-S tires measuring 205/55 up front and 245/45 out back. The car rides on Bilstein shocks, and stopping power is provided by power-assisted four-wheel ventilated discs.\n\u00a0\nThe cabin features front sport seats upholstered in Cork leather along with a color-coordinated dashboard and door panels. An Alpine head unit has been added, and the car is equipped with power windows.\u00a0The selling dealer recommends recharging the air conditioning system. Wear is visible on the outboard bolster of the driver\u2019s seat.\n\u00a0\nThe three-spoke steering wheel is leather-wrapped and frames a central tachometer with a 6,700-rpm redline and an inset boost gauge flanked by\u00a0a 150-mph speedometer, a clock, and combination gauges indicating oil level, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 50k miles, approximately 25k miles of which were added under current ownership.\n\u00a0\nThe turbocharged and intercooled 3.3-liter flat-six was factory rated at 261 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque.\n\u00a0\nThe engine number is shown above.\n\u00a0\nPower is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle and an optional limited-slip differential. The car has been fitted with a European-market exhaust system.\n\u00a0\nAll inspections welcome. We ship worldwide.\nContact us at 831.373.3131 or \n",

The Ferrari has disc brakes all around, and was one of the first production cars with independent front suspension. The engine is the famous Colombo V12 that delivers about 240 hp at 7000 rpm. Remarkable performance at the time for a 2+2.\nThe 250 GTE was also an important car for the future of Ferrari. The success of this model convinced Ferrari that there was a market for more practical, high-end sports cars. This led to the development of later 2+2 models such as the 330 GT 2+2 and the 365 GT 2+2.\nFerrari 250 GTE 2+2 for sale in Rosso Rubino\nFerrari 250 GTE 2+2 for sale at E&R Classics\nWe can help with transport.
