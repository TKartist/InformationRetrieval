        "text": "Delahaye 135 Competition 1936 $12,000,000   This is the 1936 \"Talk of Paris\" car, the beginning of the famed Figoni Streamlined Teardrop Period, an objet d'art This 1936 135 Competition Disappearing Top Convertible is notable for many reasons, including its streamlined flowing objet d'art design by Joseph Figoni, with the Figoni et Falaschi patented (795.769) disappearing top, pioneered on this car (copy in car history book). It was specially ordered when new to be equally at home on a boulevard... or on a racetrack. It has a racing engine, gearbox and chassis. It is restored to 100-point level for Concours d'Elegance competition, and is the winner of numerous prestigious concours awards. But most importantly, as the premier example of 1930s French coachbuilding, this beautiful automobile can be seen and valued as fine art, with all the implications for further appreciation that the fine art market commands. Mobile art; A true movable feast for the eyes. The chassis 46864 is correct in all respects -- Club Delahaye France Archives Rarely do competitive racing chassis and engine and imaginative aerodynamic coachwork come together in the same car. This was Figoni et Falaschi's signature style applied to a convertible... the new flowing streamlined coachwork for which Figoni-Falaschi would become internationally famous. It most dramatically illustrates Figonis famed streamlined creations, in this case for a wealthy Parisian named Wolf, a personal friend of Figonis. Wolf could afford the best of the best, so he challenged Delahaye and Figoni to create a car with elegant line, fine et elance, with the fast and reliable Competition 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine, and the competition chassis... bearing in mind his intent to race the car and enter in rallies, as well as concours events and various showings for Figoni. This is one of the most elegant creations of Joseph Figoni and one of the most important Delahaye cars. -- Club Delahaye France Archives The Delahaye Type 135 Competition long-wheelbase chassis was a factory competition special, ordered by Monsieur Wolf to satisfy his purposes of personal use, concours events and racing requirements. At Delahaye, the competition engine was placed into the rugged Type 135 Competition chassis, a durable advanced design for its time, proved in the coming years at races like the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This Delahaye 135 Competition Convertible has been authenticated by Club Delahaye France, and Figoni records, as the original body (Figoni # 581) and chassis (Delahaye # 46864) with all pertinent numbers on the car matching the original Figoni and Delahaye records. The Competition Engine. The car is powered by a 3.5 liter (3557cc) overhead valve, 120 horsepower, inline six-cylinder Delahaye engine, foundry-marked T35 (built in 1935). It is coupled to a rugged 4-speed manual competition transmission with synchromesh on the top three gears. This car was ordered with the competition engine version, with a matched set of triple downdraft Solex 40PAI carburetors, a higher-compression cylinder head, an oil cooler, and two fuel fillers in the trunk. The engine and 4-speed competition gearbox are positioned low in the chassis, thus contributing to the benefits of a better-balanced vehicle. In the front, you'll find an independent suspension using transverse leaf springs as the lower control arm (see accompanying photos). Powerful brakes and 17\" Rudge-Whitworth chromed wire wheels with 5,60 x 6,00 Michelin tires were fitted. The wheelbase is 116 inches, front track is 54 7/8 inches, and rear track is 58 3/4 inches. Other special competition components include: When Joseph Figoni took delivery of Wolf's rolling chassis from the Delahaye factory, he set out to make the most streamlined body possible. He wanted the convertible top to be lowered within the body. Today, we take this complex process for granted. But back then, Figoni, a streamlining pioneer, had to invent a very effective disappearing top for this car. The folding mechanism is described in French Patent 795.769, Perfectionnements aux vhicules dcapotables, applied for October 1, 1935 and issued January 13, 1936, just preceding the construction of this car. The Type 135 Competition would be successful on nearly every venue in which it competed. It earned victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Monte-Carlo Rallye, the Paris-Saint-Raphael race, several Grand Prix races, and many other events both before and after WWII. In 1937, a year after this long-wheelbase 135 Competition was delivered to Monsieur Wolf, similar Type 135 Competitions won the Monte Carlo Rallye, and placed first and second at Le Mans. And our car, so beautiful at Concours showings, is an integral part of that championship heritage, itself placing 6th in the 1949 Monte Carlo Rallye out of a field of 230 cars, in an extremely difficult and dangerous race on the rutted muddy wreck-strewn roads of post-war Europe. This flowing teardrop is Figoni one of one piece unique, combining the Delahaye identity in the grille and hood with generous teardrop fenders flanking Marchal headlights tucked tightly to the grille and a pair of separately controlled Marchal fog lights fitted low below them. The fender shape is echoed at the rear with skirts enclosing the rear tires. Chrome accents highlight the fender trailing edges matching the chrome accent sweeping back from the peak of the grille, down across the doors then filling the rear fender joint and small chrome spline down the rear deck. The lines are beyond stunning. Monsieur Wolf granted the privilege of showing his car to his close friend Figoni, for tours and other showings of the new streamlined coachwork. Figoni himself drove this car, as Wolfs eyesight was poor enough to limit his driving. Later, Wolf hired the famous French racing team of Guy Mairesse and Paul Valle to campaign the car in various racing events. We have a photo of the team piloting the car in the Rallye de Monte Carlo in 1949, kindly supplied by Claude Figoni, Josephs son. You'll appreciate the gorgeous interior's sparkling jewel-like engine-turned dashboard, soft and supple light gray (gris) quill ostrich leather seats and door panels, piped in dark blue leather. The light-colored upholstery is a perfect complement for the stunning Bleu Fonc exterior and works perfectly with the turned pattern dash and beautiful wood accents. Carpets are dark blue as is the soft top and trunk lining. There are so many small touches that make this car unique -- like the upswept curve at the center base of the folding windshield, a theme picked up on the polished wood door panels, and on the upholstery. And, the car also has a set of matching fitted luggage as per the original build sheet. The luggage is finished in reverse colors of dark blue (bleu fonc) quill ostrich with gray (gris) edging and handles. The entire ensemble of internationally competitive streamlined teardrop wind-cheating luxury coachwork is simply breathtaking. In excellent 100-point condition, she's ready for the next owner to take to the finest concours or rally events and compete for Best Of Show with every prospect of success. She? Mais oui... ceci est une belle voiture franaise, aprs tout! Refined meticulously detailed elegance and streamlined design combine masterfully with competition engine and chassis in this piece unique objet dart, consistently judged to be one of Joseph Figonis finest creations. Show, tour or simply stare at her; a visual feast; to be savored and enjoyed as both movable art and a solid investment.  $12,000,000"

        "text": "Ford Thunderbird M Type 1962 $24,900  This 1962 Ford M-code Thunderbird hardtop has all-original equipment and only one owner, as reported by the seller. Power is supplied by a 390cid V8 and backed by an automatic transmission. The attached picture is a screenshot referenced from the \"Vintage Thunderbird Club International, Original Factory Specifications, Volume 4, November 2002\" magazine. As indicated, there were only 17 \"M\" code Hardtop models produced in 1962, \"seventeen\". That alone makes this car very rare. This car is a survivor and to my knowledge, all equipment on this car is original except items that would have been replaced due to normal wear. If the person that purchases the car desires, I still have all the parts I have had replaced. Features include a Swing-Away steering wheel; power windows, door locks, and drivers seat; factory air conditioning; and 48-spoke Kelsey-Hayes chrome wire wheels. Many new parts have been installed including the tires, brakes, fuel pump, fuel lines, brake booster, spark plugs, and wires. This Rangoon Red Thunderbird with a reported 58,874 original miles and a white leather interior comes with receipts, parts records, and a clear title. My restoration efforts have all been focused on getting the car back in road worthy condition, which it is. I have not had any interior or exterior cosmetic processes performed on this car. This will allow the new owner to put their stamp on the car by performing only the work they want. This Rangoon Red Thunderbird hardtop reportedly still wears its factory chrome and stainless trim, emblems, and handles. The original headlights, grille, and bumper can be seen at the front. The factory bumper with integrated taillights and fuel door is mounted at the rear. The seller states a cosmetic piece at the bottom of the antenna is missing and there are spots of rust at the back wheel well. There is no rust on the underside of the car. A set of 14-inch chrome 48-spoke Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels with tri-bar center caps are wrapped in 215/75/14 whitewall tires. The interior is furnished with original white leather front bucket seats with factory seat belts and a matching rear seat. This Thunderbird features the Swing-Away steering wheel. With the transmission in park, the steering wheel and column slide 18 inches to the right, allowing the driver to exit the cabin easily. The steering column is topped with a three-spoke white steering wheel with a chrome horn ring. The padded dashboard is white on the bottom and contrasting gold on the top, split by ribbed trim that flows down into the center console, which houses a 120-mph speedometer, a clock, and a fuel/temperature gauge. The odometer shows 58,874, which the seller states is accurate. The engine is an M-code version of the 390cid V8. The M-code option featured three two-barrel Holley carburetors and produced 340 horsepower. Factory chrome valve covers, a finned open-element air cleaner, and new spark plugs and wires complete the engine. Factory power brakes, air conditioning, power steering, and a mechanical radiator fan can be found under the hood. According to the seller, it was originally purchased by the late Aurelbelle Shaffer, who was the wife of the late Raymond Shaffer, the former president of Greyhound. Aurelbelle drove this Thunderbird as her second car and always kept it parked under a carport in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 1992, the car was placed in a storage facility in Arizona and kept there until it was moved to Georgia in 2010. The car remains in a building and has only been driven very sparingly since 1973. Receipts for parts and service work will be included in the sale.  $24,900"

        "text": "Chevrolet Bel Air 1954 $48,000 (OBO)  American automotive design from the 50s was one to behold, and what it lacked in performance, it made for in class and luxury. For instance, the design behind this 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air Coupe, dressed in a two-tone red and white exterior, screams old-school luxury and style and belongs on the sets of Hollywood. What makes this car stand out is its factory styling done to perfection; all its exterior trim is present and in excellent condition, with the current owner reporting new chrome trim. For that added factory appeal, this 50s beauty sits on its factory hubcaps that are wrapped with whitewall tires, with the driver having the option to fine-tune the ride height through an adjustable airbag suspension system. Matching the two-tone red and white exterior is a matching interior. Like the exterior, the interior is factory spec and made to stand out and stay true to character. Step in, and you will find the car's interior components present and in great shape; you get A/C to weather those hot summer cruises and power windows and steering in place to make every drive effortless. Engine Considering the condition of this 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air Coupe exterior and interior, it's unsurprising that this American legend's engine bay is in mint condition. Open the hood, and you are treated to the sight of a 283ci straight six powertrain neatly nestled in and providing decent performance. The highlighting factor, however, is not the performance but how clean the engine bay is. Components like the carburetor and other mechanical components stand out, shine out, and are ready to be featured in any automotive magazine. Power is sent to the car's rear wheels in true old-school fashion through a 3-on-the-tree manual transmission.  $48,000 (OBO)"

The car has never been used for daily transportation and has never seen snow or salt. The car had 6000 miles on it when I bought it and currently has 78000 on it. The car is regularly driven but only to keep it in good running condition. I have every service record on the car back to January 2005. The car drives as new with no rattles, etc. Everything on the car is original except for the front brakes, tail pipe assembly and tires. The original front brakes were replaced at about 76000. The tail pipe assembly from the cat converter back was replaced about 10 years ago. Apparently, a weld cracked. The dealer attributed the failure to fatigue in a weldas it is a complete assembly part. There was not a mark on itit simply just failed. The tires were also replaced at about 40000 miles. They were replaced with the Michelin high speed tire which was original equipment. Only one part is worn out on the car and needs to be replaced; the gas tubes on the trunk have dried outthey need to be replaced. They are hard to find. The car has never been driven hard and has no paint fade. The trunk is clean and without stains. The spare is original to the car I assume. I have never looked at the spare tire.The car has had minor paint work over the years. And the pictures show the car was repaired excellently, but it has had minor paint work. These are very rare and most of them wound up on low end used car lots because they were a cheap classy ride. In fact, the Infiniti dealer told me that my car is the last one they see at all. I have not seen one on the road for several years. My asking price is $12,500  $12,500"

The first-generation six-cylinder Mustang may not be the muscular powerhouse that pony cars evolved into, but it captures precisely what Ford intended the Mustang to be: a fun-to-drive sports car that wouldn't break the bank. These days, however, the straight-six pony car is fast becoming a unicorn amid the popularity of both factory-original and V-8-swapped Mustangs. The Ford Mustang is one of the longest surviving breeds of a classic pony car, and the generation that started the line has aged well. The blue vinyl interior sitting inside the doors is in decent condition. The dash does have two large cracks. There's no letup to quality as you focus your attention towards the awesome 60's Mustang steering wheel; the expanse of blue that is contrasted with the chrome. The instrument panel whose assortment of stock gauges are in decent condition, however, the gas gauge does not read. Just below, you'll notice the factory installed under dash air conditioning system which needs repair. We all love the originality of these vehicles. The standard interior features of the 1965 Mustang included adjustable driver and passenger bucket seats, an aftermarket MUSTANG labeled AM/FM radio, and a floor-mounted shifter.

        "text": "Chevrolet Corvette Stingray 1965 $84,990  To fans of the Corvette, the exciting refinements of the mid-year design for 1965 offered real attraction back in the day, and modern collectors still find the third-year Sting Ray package very appealing. Four-wheel disc brakes were standard, and the heat-exhaust venting worked into the front fenders was now functional. Smoother lines on the hood and grille made the car more stylish. Cosmetically restored in 2017, the example being offered here is a beautiful vehicle equipped with an A.O. Smith body. With a detailed engine bay and underside, this convertible is being sold with its auxiliary hardtop included. The car showcases itself almost delicately in its correct eye-catching Goldwood Yellow exterior, augmented by a black soft-top and matched interior. However, any ideas of being domesticated disappear as the 327/365 HP V-8 engine comes to life. This is the solid-lifter version of Zora Arkus-Duntovs legendary small-block, which features among its attributes the GM block casting number (3782870), head casting number (3782461), intake casting number (3844461) and even the No. 2818A carburetor under the chrome air cleaner. A fresh water pump and battery are among its more recent refinements. The high-winding engine is backed by a close-ratio Muncie 4-speed transmission and a 4.11:1 Positraction rear end. Other unique points of interest are the knock-off wheels with white-stripe tires, side-mounted exhaust pipes, Teakwood steering wheel and optional AM/FM radio with power antenna. The interior also features the redesigned cues for 65, such as wide-padded bucket seats and molded door paneling with arm rests. Coupled with the first big-block models arriving at mid-year, many consider 1965 to be a pivotal season for Americas Sports Car. In terms of color, only Tuxedo Black came on fewer editions in 1965 than Goldwood Yellow, and the driveline options on this example make it a standout in terms of true street performance. -Cosmetically restored 2017 -Detailed engine bay and underside -Correct Goldwood Yellow exterior -Auxiliary hardtop -Black soft top -327/365 HP V-8 engine -Close ratio 4-speed transmission -4.11 Positraction rear end -Teakwood steering wheel -Knock-off wheels -AM/FM radio with power antenna -A.O.

The year 1950 brought wider bench seating with deeper cushioning, a fused circuit-breaker electrical system and an improved version of the Chevrolet Thriftmaster inline 6-cylinder engine with larger exhaust valves and Rochester Power-Jet carburetor. This restored and rebuilt Chevrolet 3100 series 5 window is an outstanding example of the half-ton light-duty commercial pickup that helped reshape the way America drove trucks. The faithfully restored 216 CI Thriftmaster six was rated for 92 HP at 3,400 RPM with a single 1-barrel Rochester carburetor and is backed by a 3-speed manual transmission with a steering-column-mounted shifter. The engine features the optional oil-bath air cleaner that could trap and hold up to 2 pounds of dirt. Inside the ventilated custom 5-window cab is a brown leatherette-upholstered bench seat for three-across comfort and factory-issued style. A heater helps keep the cab comfortable on chilly cruises. Telescopic shock absorbers replaced earlier lever-action units in 1950 for an improved ride. The restored cab and pickup were painted into a two-tone cream-over-green color scheme with red Chevrolet lettering and pinstriped accents. New wood for the box floor and side rails was varnished to a deep finish. The signature Advance Design 4-bar horizontal grille with integral running lights is chrome plated to shine with the front bumper and guards, fog and headlight light surrounds, outside mirrors and rear bumper.

        "text": "Ford Mustang 1969 $265,000  We are proud to present this unique Mach 1 Mustang completely redesigned and modernised for 2024. This gorgeous Mustang has received a top 8 nomination at the Salon de lAuto Sport Quebec 2023 and is a standout at it is built to be driven hard and enjoyed on the road as well as in car shows. The history of the Ford Mustang dates to April 17, 1964, and it was named after the P51 Mustang Fighter Plane from World War II. A legendary plane built to fight for freedom and a car specially made to enjoy this freedom. The history of the iconic Ford Mustang doesnt stop there, the experts at Fougal Creations have created a new modernised version of the legendary Mach 1 Mustang. This stunning Mustang Mach 1 started life as a true 1969 manual red with black hood Mach 1. The vehicle received a full restauration including a brand new dynacorn chassis reinforced and upgraded by Fougal Creations for a modern feeling of rigidity. Only then the car entered in a 3500-hour restauration and modernisation project. The custom widebody was specially crafted to fit the 10-inch wider track offered by the modern suspension. Every body panels have been completely redesigned by the team at Fougal Creations. This stunning widebody was designed to enhance the exquisite original lines of the 1969 Mustang while incorporating a set of modern aerodynamics features. A custom set of lightweight 19 wheels wrapped in Michelin super sport tires improve the beautiful legendary lines of the Mach 1 which gives the car a lower stance and a very aggressive look. This Mach 1 is running a fresh 5L coyote engine breathing thru a high rpm Boss 302 intake bolted to a 5 speed Tremec transmission. This 440hp Coyote engine delivers the power to a modern 8.8 limited slip rear differential. The sound design of the custom crafted 304 stainless steel side exit exhaust system has an exotic low muscle car rumble throughout its 7500rpm rev range. This feeling is continued inside where a lot of time were invested into the design, material choice as well as all the small details, like the billet aluminum GT40 toggle switches in the custom center console. The details of the redesigned interior match the sharp exterior styling of this Mach 1. With modern Dakota digital gauges, to the carbon fiber door cards and X brace, to the two sport seats arrangement with a parcel shelf including storage and the space grey interior billet aluminum pieces. A cold blowing AC system and electric windows have been fitted for a more comfortable driving experience. This Mach 1 is finished in the Ford GT MKIV red with black satin accents and unique Fougal Designed MACH 1 decals to match the incredible quality of the bodywork. From trim less windows and front end, to the light buckets vents, every details have a dual purpose in functionality and design. This Mach 1 was created to be thrilling to drive as much as it is to be looked at. Be the first to enjoy this car has it is fresh out from the factory located in Qubec, Canada.  $265,000"

        "text": "Ford Super Deluxe 1941 $57,500 (OBO)  1941 Ford Super Deluxe Station Wagon w/ Matching 1953 Fleetcraft Clipper Runabout Boat w/ 15hp Evinrude Fast Twin Outboard 1941 Ford Super Deluxe Station Wagon is in largely original, not restored condition. 9,485 Super Deluxe Station Wagons were produced in 1941. Mileage shows as 98,052 which is believed to be correct. The wagon spent its life up until late 2019 in Virginia. I am the 5th Owner. It has one repaint in the original Loch Haven Green color which matches the trim tag. There is no rust in the body. There are photos included of the wheel wells showing this. The wood is original except for some small repairs, and is in good condition. The fabric top was replaced within the last 15 years, and is in good condition. A set of metal drip edges for the top were acquired by the previous owner after the top work was done. He felt that the edging was well done when the top was replaced & did not justify tearing it up to install the steel ones. They are included in the sale. Mechanical: At some point before the previous Owners purchase a Ford 8BA flathead V-8 was installed. He installed a new radiator, shroud, & Drake high efficiency water pumps, and it runs cool even on hot Savannah days. He had the car rewired including a plug for the boat trailer. The boat trailer currently does not have lights or wiring. A vintage turn signal kit was installed when the wiring was done, & it works great. All lights & the horn work. The radio & gauges were rebuilt when the wiring was done & they work fine. Previous owner replaced the gas tank, generator, voltage regulator, carburetor, and stock lever action shocks. Since purchasing the car I have installed a Pertronix ignition system w/ Pertronix plug wires and coil, new spark plugs, a new alternator charging set up, all new Bendix/Self Adjusting brakes on all 4 wheels, and a new 6 volt battery. Interior: The wagon has all 3 seats. The leather seating surfaces are in excellent condition with no visible wear, rips, etc. I installed all new rubber floor mats from front to rear with insulation. I also installed new interior & exterior mirrors, sun visors, and rear window hardware. The previous owner installed new dash plastic, & rebuilt the gauges & radio. Chassis & undercarriage As stated above the brake system was replaced with Bendix/Self Adjusting drum brakes. The mufflers were replaced with new glass pack units received when the car was purchased. The dual exhaust system is tight and not objectionably loud. There is an electric fuel pump near the tank that has been replaced under my ownership, & it works fine. Other than mild surface rust & grime the chassis is in fine condition. There are no noted leaks from the brake system. The tires are relatively new Coker radials that are in good condition. Driveability I keep a 6 volt Battery Tender on the car, and it starts easily, comes to an easy idle with some use of the choke, warms quickly, and drives out with no problems. Lets face it  this is an 82 year old vehicle that is built more like a piece of furniture than a modern car! Steering does not shimmy but can be somewhat vague. Brakes, even w/ the Bendix units, are not 4 wheel discs. Leave room in traffic! 1953 Fleetcraft Runabout & 15hp Evinrude Outboard Boat: from what I can find 1953 may be the first year that Fleetcraft made a fiberglass hulled boat. There is no data plate or serial # on the boat. The previous Owner bought the boat at an auction in PA, which makes sense since Fleetcraft boats were originally made in SE PA. He bought it because the hull color is such a good match w/ the wagon, plus the wood deck & interior. The hull, wood deck, & interior are all in great shape, and do not require any current work. Evinrude Fast Twin 15hp outboard can be identified as a 1953-1954 model from the Serial #15012-01914. Since I had no plans to put the boat in the water I put oil in the cylinders, pulled it through a few times, & have not attempted to start it. There is a 6 gallon portable fuel tank that goes with the sale. Trailer: I replaced the tires, tubes, and wheel bearings. Installed a trailer dolly to aid in storage. Fun Fact: The last two years, 2021 & 2022 I have been invited to bring the woody & boat to the Hilton Head Island Concours dElegance for their 2 day On the Water display of antique water craft. They got a lot of attention!  $57,500 (OBO)"

This car is fully drivable and underpriced. Buy it to drive it or buy it to flip it at the higher price point, either way you'll have fun. This is number 209 of547. It sits on it's original tires and comes with an extra set of original tires and wheels (~$5K value) in case you want to add new rubber for fun driving and then switch back to originals for show. Comes with the Molly jacket (and the box it came in, ~$2K value), the GNX book, and other fun books and documents. If you're looking at this car you know the story, but...The pinnacle in the GM Buick lineup came in 1987 with a limited-edition, specially prepared, Grand National Experimental or GNX-the ultimate development in American muscle at that time.A total of just 547 cars were built by Buick with a Grand National interior and then sent to American Specialty Cars (ASC) McLaren Performance Technologies for the GNX transformation.Improvements included a Garrett T3 turbocharger with ceramic impeller and GNX heat shield, larger capacity intercooler, reprogrammed engine management and performance suspension with torque bar and GNX-only rear differential cover.The 3.8L V6 engine in the GNX was conservatively rated for 300 horsepower at 4,400 RPM and 360 lb.-ft of torque at 3,000 RPM and backed by a specially prepared Turbo-HydraMatic 2004R transmission.The GNX will launch from 0-60 MPH in under five seconds and run a low 13-second-quarter mile.The sinister exterior featured vented fenders, a distinct lack of hood and fender emblems, and 16-inch aluminum mesh wheels with black-out face and GNX center caps. Special composite fender flares were fitted to the wheel wells to make room for the beefy wheels and tires, as well as making the car more recognizable.    $149,999"

The original idea for this vehicle was to do a traditional style frame off restoration. That project was under way when 911 happened, which is why it has the design that it does. This vehicle was build to be driven, daily if you so desire, that is what it is for, to drive, and have fun, not to just be parked and looked at. When I drive the car I always get the thumbs up sign from other drivers and pedestrians. The car is a magnet. And it's fun to show it off even though it's more fun to drive. The picture section depicts the two prior stages the vehicle was in prior to its road to completion.  The Sierra Gold pictures show the condition when the car was acquired and restoration started  The prime photo's show in stage body work and then the finished product. Included with the car is all of the invoices of work performed and receipts of parts purchased that I kept while on this mission. I have not added up the total of all the paper work that now fills a 3 binder. I also have a complete FMV appraisal done 10/2023, that will come with the car.  $85,000 (OBO)"

Under the hood, this Defender 110 features the 2.5 liter, turbo-diesel Inline-4 200TDi engine which produces enough torque to pull stumps on your farm and enough power to cruise effortlessly on the highway- all while providing remarkable fuel economy for a vehicle of this size. The engine is run through a five-speed manual gearbox with a two-speed transfer case and locking center differential for ultimate off road control. In addition to everything that comes on a standard Defender 110, this car has been modified by UK Defender specialists Arkonik with a host of welcome upgrades. One of the signature features of Arknonik are their body kit and wheel packages. On this example, a stunning set of gloss black painted fender extensions are paired with a purposeful looking front bumper mounted brush bar and black painted diamond plating on the fender tops and along the bottom of the body. Black painted side steps and a Front Runner roof rack with rear ladder add practicality to the rig and a fantastic look. The standard 16\" wheels have been swapped out for an 18\" set of Khan Design wheels painted in black and shod in knobby BFG K02 off road wheels with a matching rear mounted spare. All of the lighting has been swapped out to LEDs and auxiliary units have been added to the roof rack and brush bar. The interior has been thoroughly upgraded with high quality black and tan leather interior and the front seats are heated. A set of black all weather floor mats cover the black carpet and a large center console offers extra storage and cup holders for the front passengers. The Arkonik build on this Defender was completed in September of 2016 and shows just over 14,000 miles since the completion of the project. Arkonik Options  $115,000 (OBO)"

The previous owner acquired the truck in 2011, and a refurbishment that was completed in 2016 which included repainting the vehicle in a baby blue paint, refreshing the blue vinyl interior, and rebuilding the 345ci V8 and the four-speed manual transmission. The truck has no signs of rust and is a very clean rig inside and out. The truck has been undercoated as well as the bed of the truck. Other features include a dual-range transfer case, a chrome front bumper and trim, side body moldings, a rear step bumper, dual exhaust outlets, a push-button radio, and a heater.The clutch was replaced in July 2022. This International pickup rides on a 132 wheelbase and has Eight 200 All Wheel Drive badging on the front fenders. White-painted 16 steel wheels wear gray International hubcaps and are mounted with Power King Extra Traction tires. The truck is equipped with manually locking front hubs, and braking is handled by front discs and rear drums. The interior was refreshed under previous ownership, and the bench seat has been reupholstered in blue vinyl. Features include a cabin heater, lap belts, a black dash-top cover, vent windows, and a push-button AM radio. A three-spoke steering wheel frames a horizontal 120-mph speedometer, an ammeter, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The truck is powered by a 345ci V8 that was rebuilt during the refurbishment and is equipped with an electric fuel pump. The truck also had a Holley Fuel Injection installed last year that makes this rig run flawlessly. Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. This is a remarkable truck that gets compliments everyone it goes and is questionably one of the nicest Series 200 truck around today.  $62,500"

        "text": "Chevrolet Corvette 1982 $27,950 (OBO)  The Collector Edition Corvette This is a 1982 Collector Edition Corvette, the last of the third-generation Corvettes.The Collector Edition Corvette has special Champagne paint and upholstery, special cloisonn crossed-flag emblems on the hood, steering wheel and rear deck, a custom exterior graphics package with shadow-style graphics on the hood and sides, varying from Champagne to dark brown, along with a special set of 15-inch turbine-vane aluminum wheels.These are similar to the custom wheels on the 1963 split window coupe. The custom interior includes champagne leather seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, matching carpeted floor mats, (CC1) smoke colored T-top removable roof panels, matching carpeted luggage area with black concealment shade.The rear window hatch was engineered with hinged glass to open on the Collector Edition Corvette, rather than a fixed window.Although due to a design flaw, most hinges fail after regular use. Collector Edition Corvettes also has standard equipment that was optional on other 82 corvettes such as electric windows, (AG9) six-way power drivers seat, (AU3) power door locks, (K35) cruise control, automatic electric antenna, (DG7) power mirrors, (C49) rear window defogger, etc. The 5.7-liter, 350 cubic inch, L83 V8 uses Cross-fire fuel injection which features two cross-mounted 48mm throttle-body injection units. Each throttle-body feeds one bank of cylinders on the v8 engine. This gives it 200 horsepower at 4,200 rpm and 285 lb.-ft of torque. During full throttle a solenoid operated door in the hood opened to allow air directly into the air cleaner. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. This car can move. 1982 corvettes came with a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and a lockup torque-converter clutch - breakthrough technology at the time. The collector edition includes standard features such as power steering and brakes, a telescoping and tilting steering wheel, pop up halogen headlamps, full instrumentation such as fuel, oil pressure and temp gages, tachometer, and voltage.Four-wheel independent suspension.Limited slip 2.87 differential. An authentic Collector Edition Corvette will have a 0 as the sixth character in its VIN as this car does.Production was limited to 6,759 cars.This makes this car a rarity. About this Collector Edition Corvette I Bought this Vette here in Maryland in late 1984 from a GM mechanic who loved it but couldnt afford it.It had about 20,000 miles on the odometer. Today its 61,000 miles. For a few years I commuted in it, before making it my weekend ride. Its always been garaged, even at the office. My employer paid for all maintenance and repairs, so nothing needed was missed. To my knowledge, the car has not been in an accident and the engine is original. Restoration Over the past 12 months, Ive invested over $10,000 in restoration. All documented.Including: Additional Features Also included is a custom cotton dust cover and a framed poster of the 1982 Collector Edition Corvette.The dust cover is especially helpful for protecting the car in your garage. I have the original keys, as well as several copies.Plus, the original T-top leather storage covers, original owners manual and the Chevrolet Corvette service manual are included.See photos. Notice the champagne leather T-top bracket bag in the back - this is for the optional: (V54) Roof Panel Carrier.It contains mounting brackets for the T-tops when theyre off the car.I have included photos of the mounting frames.Theyre like new.Ive never seen these offered for sale in like new condition. Not a Perfect Car There is a scratch on the passenger door, which Ive shown in the photos.I had a recent quote of $350 to repaint the door.Ive also highlighted a few other flaws, no matter how trivial, in the photos. Aside from the Air Conditioning, all power features and gauges on this car work.The air conditioning compressor runs, but needs Freon.The rear windows on Collector Edition Corvettes nearly all have problems opening due to the design flaw in the hinges.The release handle on this car does not allow the rear window to open. Want to learn more? Id be glad to put a prospective buyer in touch with both the local Corvette mechanics whove recently worked on the car.Theyre more than happy to speak with you.You are also welcome to hire a mechanic for an independent opinion on the car.Of course, I will answer any questions you might have to the best of my knowledge. Asking Price The asking price is not arbitrary nor based on an inflated opinion of the cars condition.After much study, I set the asking price based on the recent sale of a Collector Edition Corvette, in very similar condition and owner history.That car sold for $29,400 at auction sixteen months ago. Auctions are a strong indicator of true market value.Ive observed at least eight other completed auctions of similar vehicles in that price range in the past two years.Allowing for the air conditioning and the scratch on the door, Ive set my price slightly lower.I believe its a very fair market price for this car. Why you should seriously consider this car Buying this car is like stepping back in time to 1982. Its in showroom condition. I love this car, but Im selling it to make room in my garage for some other projects.Ive thoroughly enjoyed it, but now its time to pass it on to bring joy and someone else. When I sell a car, my name goes on the bill of sale.There should be no surprises for the buyer.Ive made every effort to be candid about the true condition of the car. Every repair expense since Ive owned it is fully documented and indexed in a binder.See photos.These records are included with the car so you can protect your investment. When you buy a car from a dealer, you dont know the history of ownership and care.This dramatically increases your risk.With this car, you have a wealth of information available to you.Including a 40-year ownership history.Plus the recent investment of over $10,000 in restoration.All fully documented. A quality classic corvette is an investment.They always go up in value.If you compromise your standards, and buy a low priced, low quality, classic car, youre setting yourself up for failure if you ever choose to sell it.But if you buy a high quantity specimen, like this one, and take good care of it, youll do very well if you decide to sell it.Thats far more important than bargain hunting or haggling for a great deal.Think strategically about the long game for your investment.Dont let this one get away. Summary This is a high end, recently restored collector vehicle.If you want a C3 Collector Edition Corvette in original condition, that you wont have to spend time and money on to drive and enjoy after you invest in it, with a known and documented history, this car wont disappoint you.  $27,950 (OBO)"

This award winning 67 GTO Hardtop Coupe was ordered from the factory with special metallic paint Plum Mist and factory air. While this was a GM color, Pontiac stopped offering plumb mist on the GTO in 1966. Born in Pontiac, Michigan on October 31st, this special order GTO was delivered to Smith Motor Company in Laurens, South Carolina. Years later the car was found abandoned in a Texas auto body shop, when it later underwent a complete frame off (1/16) rotisserie restoration in 2016. The car has its numbers matching Pontiac 400 4bbl with 335hp, three-speedTurbo-HydramaticTH-400, which was equipped with aHurst Performancedual-gate shifter, called a \"his/hers\" shifter, that permitted either automatic shifting in \"drive\" or manual selection through the gears. Everything works as it should and it is documented that the car has been driven less than 2600 miles since restoration. It has always been stored in a climate-controlled garage. The car comes with restoration documentation as well as Pontiac Historical Societys documentation of the special paint code and window sticker. It received the Restored Auto award at the 2021 Good Guys car show. All sheet metal is original other than the hood which was purchased after the original was damaged by the sand blasting process. The exhaust and headers were replaced during restoration and provides a great rumble from the stock 400. Designed by John DeLorean, the Pontiac GTO is considered of the most desirable cars of the muscle car era. The 1967 is often considered the most desirable, featuring sleek design updates to the hood, grill and taillights. I am sad to see my baby go, but it is time to turn over the keys and let someone else enjoy this classic icon of American car history.   $74,900"

When finished, it was gifted to his nephew, a newly minted Medical Doctor. In the interim the Doctor had accepted a position in France, so he took possession, drove to Minneapolis then sold it to me in early November 1977. Since then it has been meticulously maintained for a very demanding Mechanical Engineer. Effectively I am the original owner although technically the car has been mine for 46 years less the few weeks it was in transit. In Minneapolis the car was stored in a heated garage from October to May every year until 1986 when it was relocated to California and then to Arizona, where it has been garaged ever since.  The 1977 Corvette is a beautiful automobile, but this model year also had some significant disappointments. The 1977 Corvette is a 3500-pound sport car designed to operate with 350+ horsepower. By 1977 the L-82 engine output had been reduced by almost 150 HP due to emission controls. in my opinion, this model with 210 HP is underpowered and, even with the California Emission Certification option installed, it still failed to meet California or Canadian emission standards.  The shortcoming was addressed by Twin City Racing in Minneapolis who Installed an Edelbrok performance intake manifold and in 1984 after a 2-year year search installed a factory set of 2.17 Chevy heads. Estimated improvement 100-115 HP, several years later a custom exhaust system was fabricated and installed. The factory double y single cat converter system was replaced with larger diameter straight pipes utilizing exhaust routing layouts designed into the Corvette frame. Another catalytic converter and twin high bypass mufflers completed the design. The results were amazing! Emissions for hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, idle and loaded, were roughly 90% lower than Arizona mandates. A copy of the last emission test is attached.  As this Corvette sits today, it has roughly 350 horsepower, was licensed in California for 14 years and had noproblempassing California emission protocols. If the buyer prefers a Survivor car most original factory parts are like new, including AM/FM stereo radio, clock, radiator tanks, set of 2.02 heads, intake manifold and other spare parts. It was last repainted in 1997. In 2004 Mike Scott, a Corvette judge and owner of Corvette Corrections in Anaheim California appraised the car for not less than $20,000 ($32,200) in 2023 dollars. In the appraisal he also said this is one of the nicest 1977 Corvettes I have inspected. It is also one of the rarest by color combination. Black exterior and smoke gray leather interior. This car has been kept in very good condition inside and out. This vehicle is also highly optioned.  A copy of the appraisal is attached. Maintenance log is available.    $32,200"

It has not been changed since it rolled off of the showroom floor in the fall of 1961. It is complete with the 409 engine, 4-speed transmission, and the Super Sport package. This survivor is one of 142 ever built. This car comes with both the Muncie and Borg and Warner 4 Speed transmission. This car in magazines: More pictures: http://www.mjpropix.com/Cars/Impala-Super-Sport/ Chevrolet brought real power to the people during 1961, and did so with style. The midyear introduction of the Super Sport option package showcased another new arrival, the 409-CUIN V8. The SS kit was offered on any Impala. It included Super Sport trim inside and out, chassis reinforcements, stronger springs and shocks, power brakes with sintered metallic linings, spinner type wheel covers, and of Chevys earliest uses of narrow band whitewall tires. The dashboard gained a Corvette type grab bar, and the steering column got a 7000 RPM Tachometer. Only Chevys toughest V8s were offered with the SS package. It was available with 348-CUIN with four-barrel or tri power. The other choice was the 409. Essentially a larger displacement 348, its upgrades include forged aluminum pistons, a wilder camshaft and 11.25:1 compression. A single four-barrel mated to the aluminum manifold. It made 360 bhp. It also made history. Chevy built 491,000 Impala for 61. Only 453 had the SS package and of those, just 142 got the 409. But word spread quickly. Here was a mainstream Chevy V8 with 409 lb-ft of torque and the ability to turn mid 15 second quarter-miles with the standard 3.36:1 rear axle and mandatory four-speed manual transmission.

Did it work? As an engineering triumph, you bet. Though Hemi-headed engines had been used by racing and high-end brands in the pre-war era, it took Chrysler to bring them to mainstream America in the post-war era. Among other advantages: The shape of the combustion chamber allowed a central spark plug location for more efficient fuel ignition, and valve sizes grew because they didn't rub shoulders with one another, as they did in conventional engines. A better burn and bigger valves meant more power. Chrysler's Hemi weighed in at the same 331-cu in displacement as the mighty Cadillac V-8, and the Mopar put out 20 more horsepower. And Dodge dropped theirs into every body style it offered: coupe, sedan, wagon, convertible, whatever. Displacement grew rapidly, as did Dodge's cars, through the 1950s: an overbore in 1955 brought displacement to 270 cubes and 150 hp. The Century's hemispherical V-8 lasted into the mid-1980s.

It was ordered with a lot ofoptions andits overall appearence isextremely close to what it is with a couple minordifferences.  This car was meticulouslyrestored 10yrs ago and was barely driven since (less than 91miles). The condition of the body reflects the mileage and doesn't show any sign of wear. There is not a stonechip in the paint, not even in the wheel wells. The''Springtime Yellow''paint which is the original color, is immaculate. Nice finish, no scratches or stonechips, and definitely no rust. Gaps between the panels are perfectThe undercariage is also perfect, it was completely sandblasted before being repainted in the original ''Red Oxyde'' primer, and oversprayed with the exterior color, exactly how it would have been from factory. It originaly came with the ''Lower Back Panel Grille'' Exterior Decor Group, which includes the following: Pop-open Gas Cap, Chrome Wheel Wells modlings, Fog Lights, Louvered Hood with Turn Signals.  This one is a ''C-Code'' and was equipped with a 289ci with the a2bbl Autolite 2100 300CFM carburator. The original engine is still in the car, was rebuilt during the restoration. It has about 91 miles since rebuild. We just did a complete tune-up and drove the car to make sure everything was functionning properly due to being stored for a long period of time. The original C4 Transmission was replaced for a rebuilt 4-Speed Toploader. Rear end is still the original 8'' with 2:79 gears.  It also came with the optional Power Steering, front Power Disc Brakes, Tinted Glass, A/C and AM Radio. All of these are still on the car except for the original A/C System.  It never ran on rainy days. This car has all original metal body panels from what we observed.  The interior was restored.

I have upgraded the stereo system to a RetroSound System with Bluetooth and kick panel speakers. The convertible top is power and in very good condition. I am the second owner of this car which I bought in 1982. I drove it for some years before I got around to doing a restoration on it. It is an older restoration that is still in excellent condition as the car has been garaged all it's life. The engine is rebuilt with approx. 35,000 miles and the trans is also rebuilt. I have owned this car for approx. 41 years and have lovingly taken care of it and never beat on it. Overall, the car is in excellent condition but not perfect. Body and paint are excellent (no dents or rust) but there is a peppering of small paint chips, that I have touched up on the bottom of the fenders and quarter panels. The car never required a frame off restoration as I have owned it since it was 11 years old and the previous owner and myself have always garaged it, meaning is has virtually never seen any bad weather in it's life and has been kept out of the sun. I have maintained a folder that contains receipts and documentation dating back 30+ years. This car still has all 5 of it's original SSI Chrome Wheels, original dash pad, most of it's original sheet metal and original factory firewall markings. I have the original Broadcast Sheet, Window Sticker, Protecto-Plate, Owner's Manual and the letter that was sent to the original owner who ordered the car new, by Oldsmobile, thanking him for the purchase and providing himwith the new vehicles VIN. This 442 was also professionally appraised in July 2023 at over $ 79,000. Generally speaking, this car checks all the right boxes for a well kept classic muscle car.It runs great, it looks great and all the accessories work including the A/C.

        "text": "Harley-Davidson Motorcycle 1970 $8,000  No other like this one in the World. This head turner is not only a collector but will make other riders jaws drop in envy!! NO JOKE. Everyone loves this bike when they see it. If I didn't have a wedding to pay for I'd keep it forever. In response to the sales success of smaller Japanese bikes in the 1960s, Harley-Davidson formed a plan to offer a new small-displacement machine to compete as its own small-engined Hummer model left a lot to be desired. Around this same time Aermacchi was interested in focusing more resources on its aeronautical division and allowed Harley to grab a 50 percent stake in Aermacchis moto-division for just $250K. Aermacchi fit the bill to a T as far as what H-D had in mind as the Italian marque produced a solid little 250 that possessed a lot of potential for further development. The 250s that were born out of this arrangement quickly proved themselves in competition, taking various podium spots in high-profile and prestigious events like the lightweight class of late 60s and early 70s TTs. Around this same time, the quarter-liter Italimerican racer was taken and bored out an extra 100 ccs, resulting in the 350 which was produced from 69-74. Unfortunately, the more impressive characteristics of the race-bred 350s  such as its short-stroke cylinder dimensions and five-speed transmission  failed to trickle down to the production model racers, leaving the 250s and 350s to finish at the bottom of the pack in magazine class shootouts of the era. As a consolation prize, the Harlimacchi did get the best gas mileage of all the machines in its class at 47-58mpg. At the heart of the Sprint 350 was an air-cooled 344cc OHV single that produced a claimed 25 hp at 7,000 rpm and had a reported top speed of 92.49 mph (presumably with a jockey-sized pilot and a solid tailwind). The bike had a half-wet (half full fuel tank) weight of 323 lbs, and sold new in 1969 for $795, an amount that translates to a little under $5.5K in todays money. The Sprint wasnt a particularly hot seller in the States, though it did do better after being given a new name. When it first arrived on American shores the Sprint was initially dubbed The Wisconsin. And while sales might have been satisfactory at dealerships in the Green Bay area, it didnt attract many buyers from outside the bikes namesake state, and thus the moniker was changed to the Sprint which could be appreciated on a more universal level. Despite them both being production models, far fewer 350s were produced than 250s, making examples noticeably more rare and therefore valuable. I wont get into the debate on whether or not people should be resto-modding rare classics (especially when theres a lot more mod than resto), but I will say this 350 has been thoughtfully  and tastefully in my opinion  upgraded. While its appearance is subjective, its almost impossible to argue with the mechanical and performance-related upgrades that have gone onto this 1970 350. Starting with the engine, this SS350 was given a new Wiseco race piston, new carb and K&N air-filter, new valves and guides, new gaskets and seals, and new clutch disks. The ignition and electrical systems have been refreshed via a new Power Dynamo 12-Volt generator and voltage regulator, new 12 volt ignition coil, points, condenser, and spark plug all made by Pertronix. According to the ad, there are also a handful of unmentioned upgrades and parts. Other non-mechanical upgrades include new cables throughout, new chain, new fork seals and O-rings, a NOS H model fuel tank, new Pingel fuel shutoff-valve, new gas-cap, new rear-suspension, new cafe-style seat unit and saddle, new hardware and fasteners throughout, and a new 12-volt headlight and taillight. This little orange runner is also sitting on new Akront/Italian-style flanged alloy rims wrapped in new vintage Firestone Deluxe Champion rubber. Every surface on this 350 is pretty immaculate with pristine paint and all metal surfaces having been adequately polished. The orange and black paint digs are unmistakably Harley-Davidson racing, and there appear to be a lot of individual NOS parts such as the chrome pipes and even the vintage H-D footpegs look brand spankin new. Because only 25 miles have been put on this machine since its resto-mod job, as it currently stands its more or less a museum-quality example. I personally like it, but was this a job well done? Or is this just sacrilegious to do to a seldom-seen classic?  $8,000"

        "text": "Ford Thunderbird 1971 $29,000  Each Generation of Ford Thunderbirds from 1955 through 2005 must have a nickname, it seems. For the Fifth Production Cycle offered between 1967 and 1971, T-bird enthusiasts have assigned the name Glamor Bird. The label is certainly appropriate, as this was the largest and most luxurious Thunderbird offered to date. In a further departure from the traditional Thunderbird image as a Personal Sport-Luxury Automobile, the Convertible body style was discontinued. In its place, a four-door model was added to the lineup, officially known as the Landau with a wheelbase of 117.2 inches. This longer T-bird sedan chassis was shared with the Lincoln Continental Mark III. Since they were both born in the same factory in Wixom-Michigan. To add some more distinctive features, the rear doors were hinged at the rear and opened from the front, the arrangement famously known in the years past as \"Suicide Doors\". In most other aspects the four door T-bird was virtually identical to its Coupe sibling, with a luxury cabin and every available convenience gadget of the era. Priced in the $4800.- to $5500.- range, the Glamor Birds were far and away the most expensive cars in the Ford lineup, priced at a few thousand more than a comparable Galaxie or LTD. For the 1970-1971 model years, all the Glamor Birds including the Landau Sedan received new front-end styling and tail light section as well. The prominent protruding nose a.k.a. \"Bunkie Beak\" and tail light lenses - resembling spread wings - was a favorite of then Ford President Semon E. \"Bunkie\" Knudsen. The '70-'71 model years were the best built Thunderbirds to date. Printed circuitry, introduced in 1968, continued to make the instruments reliable and accurate. Thunderbird's dignified ride was designed by computer. Their interiors were pressure tested at the Factory to check for air leaks. Since this body style had been around for four years, they left the Assembly Plant pretty much perfect. The Thunderbirds for 1970-'71 were the most elegant looking and very dependable due to a strong and smooth running 429 Thunderjet Engine with four-barrel Carb. paired to a C-6 Automatic Transmission, complete with a Dual Exhaust. Perhaps at some point in the future, the question posed will be, \"Whatever happened to four door Thunderbirds?\" Already rare to begin with, when these cars are finally given the recognition they deserve, prices will go through the roof. For four-door T-bird Collectors today, their wisdom and insight will no doubt prove to be a prudent investment for them! The beautiful four-door Landau made its final appearance for 1971, with a production number of 36000 total Thunderbirds produced. Of those, only 6500 were made as four-door sedans. This particular example has the bench seat, where only 2300 were created! This desirable piece of Automotive Design and History is highly coveted and sought after by experienced Collectors and Investors alike as a Legacy to the Car Designers of the past! It is the rarest of all T-bird model years. This stunning specimen in particular, wears an exterior that is presented in a striking Burgundy Fire Poly with color matching disc hubcaps and captivating Onyx Black Metallic Roof, that accents the contrasting Landau Bars very well and spells Pure Class! This color scheme is paired to an inviting Cream Interior with plush Red Carpeting. The car, though mostly original, has only been mildly restored to keep its authenticity. The undercarriage still has lots of \"Ziebart\" Rust Protectionleft. It comes with a new starter, brake booster, new battery, power window motors, new tires, complete new exhaust system (front to back) and all fluids changed and is ready to be enjoyed! Also included are two spare sets of hubcaps (dog dish and turbine style), rear window, windshield, grill, headlight bezels, cornering lights, chrome oil pan and a front bumper guard which was a rare option! Delivery in an enclosed Transporter, within B.C. and Alberta included in price! Loosing storage space for the upcoming Winter Season, therefore open to reasonable offers!  $29,000"

Original engine and ZF TRANSMISSION.Pantera number 1, 2 and 3 were built as prototype bodys only with no engine for show use only and are believed to be non existent ~destroyed. Car number 4 and 5 were believed to be sound and crash tested so this car number 1006 is believed to be the first complete car ever shown and sold in Italy and then later shipped to the USA.

This car has every available option. It drives, handles, and looks like new with 31524 actual miles. It has the original owner's manual, pre delivery inspection sheet from July 1987 and window sticker. Also available are a Carmax report done in 2014 as well as one from January 2023. We purchased this car in January 2018 from Vintage Motor Cars. At that time, the mileage was 28,685. the 2800 miles added since then are from the annual New Mexico route 66 moto tour, car shows, and once in a while out to dinner on special occasions. The additions we made are typical for a car that spends most of its time stored in a garage as opposed to on the road. They includea new radiator, hoses, belts, all filters, shock absorbers, spark plugs and catalytic converter. All maintenance was performed by a retired Chevrolet technician using genuine GM parts with the exception of the KYB shocks and Magni Flo hi-flow catalytic converter. A new battery was installed in April 2020 and new BF Goodrich tires in May 2021. The rarity of this one-year-only model cannot be overstated. In 1986 200 Aero Coupes were manufactured and distributed to NASCAR. In 1987, 6052 were produced and made available to the general public. These were all built in Pontiac, Michigan with the RPO code Z16. Major improvements over the 1986 model were a second gas strut to support the shorter deck lid, and the speedometer was changed from 85 mph to 120 mph. The 1987 model was available in four colors; maroon, which is by far the most common, black, white and silver. This car has not been modified in any way and is just as it came off the assembly linewith the exception of the shocks and catalytic converter. We welcome any questions from serious buyers and will provide honest answers including additional pictures if requested.  $29,500"

Fiberglass (W25) Outside Air Induction hood with lock down hood latches and fiberglass rear wing. Original date coded SSIII wheels painted to Matador red body color. Complete new black bucket seat interior including headliner, Rally Gauge Pack, power steering and front disc brakes. The original motor is long gone but it currently has the Factory Warranty 455 cubic inch replacement engine (rebuilt). There is no VIN stamped on block pad. The pad is still cast and has never been machined. Original date coded aluminum intake manifold and also original to the car is the M22 4 speed Rock Crusher transmission (rebuilt) with original Hurst shifter and center console. The car also features the original TO coded rear end with 3:73 gears and an added W27 rear end cover along with an aluminized exhaust system.Red inner fenders, new windshield, new bumpers and an odd, not often seen option, is the B85 window reveal trim molding. Extremely clean inside, outside and underneath. In my opinion this isa high number 2 car. I have documented the restoration of this car on a thumb drive with about 200 photos. Furthermore, I have a 2-3 inch folder that contains receipts of parts, labor and titles from previous owners from years gone by. My research has indicated the production numbers for 1971 Oldsmobile 442 W30 is 810 hardtops and 247 4 speed cars. The 442 styling and color combination make this W30 a constant head turner and gets the thumbs up where ever she goes. I purchased the car from a co-worker approximately 11 years ago. He was not the first owner. Possibly the second or third owner. The best that I can recollect from his story is that over 20 years ago or so, he dated his wife in this car. Then a variety of issues came about, mainly leaks but the car was still running good. Shortly after getting married and buying a house the car went into hibernation in his garage and had been sitting in his garage for about 15 years. The odd but true story is that he and his wife bought a modest house with a 1 car garage. So up until the time I bought the car his and his wife's daily cars sat outside while the W30 was garaged. When I met this co-worker I already had a 71 442 convertible. He asked me to come by his house to show his wife what a restored 442 looked like and take a look at his 442. This next part I remember very well. When he opened the garage door it just hit me that I had not asked him (if by some outside chance) it was a W30 and he said yes it was and it was also a 4 speed car. As I entered the garage I saw the W30 badges on the side of the fender. The next day in work he asked me if I would be interested in buying his 442 W30. I wasn't looking for a project car but I couldn't turn down a W30. So we struck up a deal with one stipulation, that I would restore the car and not part it out. I agreed, purchased the car and started on an approx. 1 year complete frame off rotisserie restoration. I don't know every detail about the history of this W30 and neither did my co-worker friend that I bought the car from. But through my years of (on and off) research I have compiled what I believe is the history of this car. This car was built in May of 1971. It appears that during the warranty period the motor was damaged. It also appears the motor was replaced with a 1972 W30 Factory Replacement Block and possibly Heads. Being that the car was originally built in May of 1971 that left only 2 months of 1971 manufacturing before the factory would start tooling up for the 1972 models. So that is why I believe within those 2 months or while the car was still under warranty, the motor was damaged and replaced with the 1972 motor. Finally, along with the car goes 4 extra date coded wheels, misc. stainless steel trim, a die cast model and a car cover.   $110,000"

(Vin# 40867S103144) There was also some body damage. My father owned a very prestigious auto body repair shop where I worked. Over the next five years I installed the following:  Custom exhaust system with cutouts Aluminum four speed transmission Custom dashboard Custom upholstery Custom seats Custom steering wheel Custom body  I converted the body from a convertible to a hardtop with a removable roof. The roof when not installed fits behind the seats. The body was completely custom built and not a kit body. There are no other vehicles like this one. I retained all of the Corvette inner panels and door mechanisms. The steering, suspension, windshield, drivetrain are all standard Corvette and parts are readily available.   I built the automobile to be driven on the street and not a show car. I did however enter it in several shows where I took first place. Because of work related issues I drove the vehicle less than 300 miles when I parked it in a barn and it has not been driven for over 50 years.  The car will require work to be driven. The body is in excellent condition but has some paint chips. The tires are dry rotted and several have blown out. The aluminum wheels are pitted. There is some upholstery mouse damage. The rubber items like radiator and break hoses will have to be replaced. Battery is missing. The driver door glass is cracked.  The vehicle is located on a farm 40 miles North of Pittsburgh Pa. Moving it will require a flatbed tow truck. Contact me if you have any questions.    $65,000"

        "text": "Studebaker Gran Turismo 1964 $23,500 (OBO)  After purchase in 2005, mechanically this car has been almost entirely rebuilt. Originally was a floor plan unit ordered by Studebaker Memphis and left the South Bend factory on September 17, 1963. Car was delivered to first owner for near list price one year later. Has dealer installed air conditioning, which is almost exactly the same installation as from factory. Factory options included the climatizer (heater), disk brakes, and the 3-speed Power Shift transmission. The original odometer read in the 80,000 range, but inspection of the condition of things indicated a lot more than that, but maybe not a roll-through to 180,000. The entire speedometer quit about ten years ago, and was replaced by a \"brand new\" out-of the box NOS unit. It now reads @3,200 miles since then. The car is driven only in the summer, and only around town. The car comes with the records of all done to it after purchase. A lot. Actually, almost everything. The front end completely rebuilt. The engine was torn completely out and entirely rebuilt from boiling the block to new pistons, hard valve seals, and just about everything else. The multi-page initial repair bill comes with the car. It was essentially a new 289 and Powershift transmission attached to a rebuilt front end as well as attention to the 3.31 rear end. Pertronics electronic ignition has been installed. The rebuilder - Mountain High Performance - was known as the regional Studebaker expert, as the owner started out working at Denver's largest Studebaker dealer. There are a lot of things specific to Studebakers that traditional mechanics can miss. Accessory components also replaced later on. Replaced AC compressor and clutch in @ 2007. Did blow cold, but have left it alone since then, mainly because when you need AC, weather is hot. That means the constriction of air due to the front condenser makes the car run hot, too. So, here driving up and down the Colorado mountains in the summer, it has not been used. A new alternator installed in 2012, as well as a new power steering ram and kit in 2017. Has Studebaker AM/FM radio - rare for 1963-64 - which can likely be brought back to life. These cars only had one speaker - in the back - so surround sound isn't in the cards. Summary: Now, about 6,000 miles on a completely and professionally rebuilt 289, starting with boiling the block and moving up from there. Hardened valve seats installed with new bearings, high compression pistons, and installation of 4-barrel manifold and new Edelbrock carburetor, raising the engine to essentially 225HP JetThrust configuration. Front end reworked. Drives very nice. Studebakers tend to be prone to vapor lock with today's gasoline. An auxiliary electric fuel pump is installed to assure flow and can be turned on when necessary. In the 17 years since re-build, traditional Studebaker leaks have come back, but none apparently are anything serious. A couple of drips here there, probably. The car has been owned by people interested in collecting. It appears that the exhaust system (dual) was somewhat newer when it arrived here. Front and rear bumpers were either NOS or rechromed and, while stock, were obviously not the parts on the car when it first left South Bend. Orher than a minor chip on the front cowl, the chrome is really excellent. Other brightwork is ok and there are a couple of pieces extra. The real value of this 64 Hawk is its mechanicals. I wanted a 64 Hawk I could drive, not necessarily win shows. Cosmetically, it has been pretty much left alone. Please understand that appearance-wise this car is a 20-footer. Over the years some liberties have been taken with attachment of some brightwork, and the re-paints are several kilometers from perfect. Have not found any meaningful rust. This Hawk is great for everyday driving and going to the local classic car shows. Because the mechanics have been addressed, it would be perfect for someone wanting to use it as a solid base for addressing the cosmetic flaws. The headliner, wind lace, and upholstery are okay, but are worn.. The point here is that they are all attached to a Studebaker into which a lot of investment has been made in making it mechanically sound. The interior is pretty much original. Bucket seats are comfortable. Carpet was replaced, probably. The dash has the tachometer, which was an option the car did not originally leave the factory with.. A sending unit from an Avanti was located and it works fine. The clock was the original electric-wind unit from the factory. It was rebuilt with a quartz movement by Auto Instruments and keeps time perfectly. Other gauges work great, and there are a couple of back-up gauges in the trunk. Gas gauge sender has been replaced, but it still reads whatever it feels like. The important gauges - oil, temp and amps - work. The 3-speed floor shift PowerShift automatic transmission was completely re-built. Still has 2nd-gear start, with selected 1st gear start. Very smooth runner. Current TigerPaw tires have @ 1,500 miles on them and ride great. A lot of paperwork comes with this. The original dealer sticker, and the build document from the factory, also. The sales document from when it was first sold at a Mississippi dealer indicates that the buyer seemed to have paid full sticker for the car. And financed it too. Most of the invoices from the work done on the car come with it.   $23,500 (OBO)"

NEWLY STRIPPED AND PAINTED (JULY 2020) at cost of over $10k, NEWLY CHROMED BUMPERS )($2.5k),NEW MICHELIN XWX 205/70VR14 TIRES ($1.6k) summer 2020 with less than 200miles on them - same as Ferraris had in the 70's & 80's as couldn't bear to put on anything but the best), NEW REAR WINDSHIELD (we're told was last one in the world, shipped in from Dubai) All Modern Amenities including air conditioning (needs a/c hose and washer fluid pump which we keep trying to get but warehouses/parts network in Germany not presently functioning well for these older parts), power windows and power steering. Factory Sunroof. Spare Tire, Comprehensive Service Records. I've had the car since 1992 and have driven it about 4-5,000 miles since. Had it up to 150mph through the desert on the way back from California after I bought it there so the top factory speed of 143 is incorrect. Engine was rebuilt as it was burning oil and now it's fine - all the receipts are in hand and it was done by a German owned and operated small import repair shop in Chicago as referenced above. The German owner (they specialize in Mercedes) would probably be happy to answer questions about the rebuild and the car upon special request but I don't want to burden him with calls at this point. Likewise the car was stored for a long time and I wanted to get it back to 100% shape looks wise so I had Joe Filek at Captain America Designs in Hampshire, Illinois (people ship him their cars from all over the country and he is backed up about 2-3 years) do all the stripping and body work at a cost in excess of $10k and had him re-install the re-chromed bumpers. Update 8/8/2022- although $2k Climate Control Servo installed the system needs some kind of repair on that. This Mercedes-Benz manufactured Homologation Special Edition was specially built in production form to qualify for FIA racing standards, meaning in order to competitively race Mercedes-Benz had to create at least 1000 production vehicles to accompany official rally cars it wanted to race competitively. The 450SLC 5.0/500SLC coupes were produced by Mercedes-Benz from 1978 to 1981 and are among the rarest post-war models. They were manufactured by Mercedes Benz to homologate (make competition race worthy) the 5 liter for road rally purposes. Some cars were competitively campaigned with factory support, but the rest of the production was sold to the European market to meet homologation guidelines. The combination of the lighter weight and higher horsepower made for a quick and competitive car which raced successfully with the introduction of the 5 literengine in the World Rally Championship Series including First Place finishes in 1979 and 1980 at the Ivory Coast Rally. Other notable participation in competition included the Rally of Argentina, Rally of New Zealand, Acropolis Rally and Portugal Rally. The cars were given massive factory support under the leadership of Eric Waxenberger. The fact that the Managing Board of MBAG officially withdrew from world rallying in 1980 makes the 5.0 the last factory-sponsored wholly Mercedes model. The rally racing clock for Mercedes-Benz ended for good with the success of this homologated SLC special. The Last photo in the gallery is of500SLC Rally cars - Four 450 SLC 5.0 being cleaned at a rally in 1979 Along with the performance enhancements and plaudits which are detailed below, this car's comfort and daily drivability combined with every modern amenity led renowned championship drivers of the time period to use them as personal get-arounds.1979 World Champion Driver of Ferrari Team Jody Scheckter chose this as his personal car. Jean Pierre Ganier and Patrick Depailler of the Tyrrell Formula 1 team also chose the 500 as their daily drivers. 2769 of the 500SLC's were made over 2 years in 1980-81 and fewer than 100 cars were imported into the United States. In 1999 Mercedes-Benz SLC specialist Bob Hatch of Hatch and Sons estimated that at most there might be 50 of these cars in the country good enough to interest a collector, but in the years since his statement, given the drivability of the these cars, there are certainly significantly less than that at present. The example be offered here is certainly in the very top echelon of those Mr. Hatch was speaking of due to its meticulous care over the years and frankly I'd be surprised if there's one in better condition after the engine rebuild and bodywork/painting re-chroming, re-'tiring'- and all the miscellaneous new parts - anywhere. This example differs from the stock 450SLCs in several important and distinctive ways. The hood and trunk lids are made from aluminum for significant weight savings. The car weighs 3,333lbs, 220lbs less than the standard SLC. To emphasize the lengths to which MB went to upgrade the car for homologation, it even has an alloy air cleaner to add to the weight savings. The front and rear aerodynamic spoilers the factory added result in a 9  10 % reduction in wind resistance and a top speed which exceeds 142MPH. The 5.0 is the very first Mercedes-Benz aluminum block V-8 production motor and is lighter than the standard iron block . It produces in excess of a whopping 300 HP and 350lbs of torque and true blacktop powerhouse in its day. The 5.0 engine features factory reworked heads with larger valves, pressure fed valve adjusters, cross-bolted main bearing caps (4bolt mains in hot rod parlance) and many other special tweaks. The 500SLC also features the upgraded 4-speed automatic. There's a window until late October/early November where this car is for sale/viewing/driving as it won't see a drop of rain or snow and certainly not salt while it's under my care.   $65,900"

        "text": "Factory Five GTM 2016 $89,999 (OBO)  This an extremely well thought out and extremelysanitarybuild. No money was spared, I've had a bunch of pretty nice cars and has my girlfriend. The amount of attention this car gets isunbelievable. If you want something that you rarely see and that no everyone has, this may be the right car for you! See below. GTM Gen II was acquired in 2016 and the build was completed late in 2018. It was assembled and completed by a professional shop. The car is based on a tubular frame chassis (this is the Gen II that came out in 2012. So any issues with the Gen I whereperfectedand modified for the Gen II's), and the composite body is finished in yellow over a black interior (had thoughts of wrapping the car in a different color. I am not a fan of yellow). Power is provided by a mid-mounted GM Crate 6.2-liter LS3 V8 paired with a new Mendeola SDR5 five-speed manual transaxle for maximum horsepower (not a Porsche transaxle), and additional equipment includes a custom roof scoop, carbon fiber rocker panels, 18 wheels, C5 Corvette-sourced braking and suspension components, a Kooks exhaust system, air conditioning, a Pioneer multimedia receiver, and more as detailed below. This Factory Five GTM is now offered with build records and a clean Arkansas title listing the car as a 1964 Ford GT coupe. This is not a donor car. Everything is BRAND new on the car. Either bought from GM or directly from the manufacture. The bodywork is composed of aluminum and composite panels over a high-strength steel space frame chassis with an integrated six-point roll cage and contoured roof bars. This Car is finished in yellow with a black vinyl stripe and is fitted with optional carbon fiber rocker panels as well as a functional roof scoop. Additional equipment includes aluminum VRaptor Speedworks louvers, fog lights, and a rear carbon diffuser. Staggered 18 Forgestar wheels measure 9 wide up front and 12 in the rear and are wrapped in Nitto tires sized 245/40 and 335/30, respectively. The General Motors-sourced suspension features custom adjustable coil overs with Koni dampers, and braking is handled by C6 Corvette calipers over vented and cross-drilled rotors (front and back). 6 piston calipers I have also installed highperformancedustlessbreak pads. The cabin is finished in black with yellow trim on the center console. Fixed-back black leather seats feature suede inserts and STV Motorsports five-point harnesses, and additional features, A Vintage Air heating and air conditioning system, power windows, Factory Five-branded floor mats, and a 6.2 Pioneer DVD receiver with door-mounted speakers. With backup camera, Bluetooth and touchscreen for easy use. A three-spoke steering wheel on an adjustable steering column fronts a carbon fiber bezel housing Factory Five-branded instrumentation that includes a 200-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer, along with gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The digital odometer shows just under 1,900 miles. The mid-mounted 6.2-liter LS3 V8 crate engine is paired with a Mendeola SDR5 five-speed manual transaxle. A custom wiring harness was supplied by SMC Performance of Auburn Hills, Michigan and additional electrical wiring was provided by Painless Performance Products of Fort Worth, Texas. A Kooks stainless steel headers and exhaust system exits from either side of the license plate. The battery, master cylinders (Wilwood set up including break pedals), (Vintage air extreme) air conditioning components, and a Dewitts radiator with twin electric fans are located under the ducted composite hood. An eight-minute narrated video provided below details the equipment and includes in-car driving footage. Alot of attention and detail was put into this cooling system with oversized radiator and fans.  I purchased the vehicle for my Girlfriend and after 3-4 times of driving it she felt cluster phobic in the car. She has had some pretty exotic cars and said this car drove and handled better than any other car she had. We both agree on that. We also both agreed the car \"floated on air\".

A former 1968 & 1970 Winternationals Stock D Class contestant. 1964 Pontiac GTO, 389 Tri Power, 4 Speed, 17,862 original miles. Rare Sunfire Red color (factory discontinued after 6 months due to lack of interest). Believed to be the lowest mileage Sunfire Red Tri Power 4 Speed in existence. It is also estimated that less than 5 Tri-Power 4 speeds were built in this color. Here is the story. This car was originally factory ordered by Bob Weyrick while living in Ohio, to be used strictly for drag racing in Southern California. He took delivery in Portland, OR. , to get around the California Smog issues. When he arrived to pick up his car, he asked where it was. They pointed to his car and said its right there. Bob said he didnt order that pinklooking color. It turns out he had marked the wrong box on the order form. There were 3 different reds offered that year, Marimba Red, Grenadier Red and Sunfire Red. He decided to keep it and off to California he went. Bob settled in Lompoc, CA. and began drag racing THE OLD GOAT. Bob (hes passed now) said that 12,000 to 14,000 of the miles on the odometer are from being flat towed to the various drag strips around Southern California. There is tons of race history included with the car along with a large inventory of parts. More on that later. The car was raced in the mid to late 60s. Included are lots of time slips from local drag strips in the 1960s .Santa Maria Drag Strip, Riverside Raceway, Lyons Drag Strip and The Pomona Winternationals. Lots of other drag racing memorabilia, brochures from the 1968 & 1970 Winternationals in Pomona, CAwith his name and car listed in them. There is a hand written letter signed by Ed Pink, responding to Bobs inquiry about some engine work on the GTO. Original owners manual and warranty book with the protect o plate.The original M20 transmission is included. It currently has a M22 and the required scatter shield. Posi-traction rear end with 4:11 gears. Original interior. No one has ever sat in the back seat except 2 kids, once, by the previous owner. Bob red-lighted at the start of the 1970 Winternationals and that was it for THE OLD GOAT. He was so frustrated, he quitdrag racing and parked the car in his hanger where it sat for 21 years and he refused to sell it. He finally called the 2nd owner, and he bought it and owned it for 28 years. He was a body and paint guy in Lompoc and repainted the car to the original color. The paint job is show quality. Original spare, jack and jacking instructions on the trunk sticker is still there. Everything works! Included with the cararethe original M & H drag slicks (still hold air and no checking on the sidewalls). Also included are tons of 35MM slides and 8mm movies, original factory repair manual, Book signedby GTO Guy Pete McCarthy.. Sell $85,000.00 Call or text 714-469-1023 Thanks Ron  $82,000 (OBO)"

A work in progress. Needs some work on mechanical, electrical and bodywork. Engine sounds great but has some issues with being a cold starter. Transmission works, but also has issue of leaking and needing topped off here and there. Needs suspension work. Recent work on back brakes. They are drum brakes. Steering seems loose and squirrely. We put power steering in it a few years ago, so it's probably related to that. I do not consider it safe to drive at the moment. The few times we've taken her out for a spin lately, the radiator seems to get hot, but comes with a replacement radiator that we bought but didn't get put on. Not entirely sure that it's even needed, but it will go with the truck anyhow. As mentioned, a bonafide mechanic special! We have had some work done on the body over the years and there is a lot of bondo on it. Still needs work done on it if you're picky about things being perfect. Interior top of cab in particular needs work. See photos. The hood doesn't want to shut down flat like it should, it's raised up some as can be seen in photos, probably needs to be adjusted. This is a newish issue so we haven't really looked into it. The windshield is cracked, I think it's got a bb gun or rock impact crack. Comes with newish truck cover that works great for when you have it parked outside! This truck is not safe to drive on the roads currently, so buyer will have to arrange transport.

        "text": "Porsche 911 1979 $64,500 (OBO)  The 911SC Targa Sportomatic is a rare car and a great example of Porsche engineering at its very best. A masterpiece of engineering, a beauty to drive and admire, it was way ahead of its time.This car makes the perfect addition to any collection. A great car to drive, in excellent condition and an investment in the future. The semi-automatic transmission, Sportomatic, became optional from the late 1960's. This particular car, the 3.0-litre engine 911SC Targa model, was introduced in 1977 and built until 1983. Porsche ceased manufacture of the Sportomatic in 1982 having produced relatively few cars over a 5 year period, making this car today a rare car indeed. A right hand drive vehicle, it is probably the only one of its kind in the USA. I purchased this 1979 air cooled Porsche in London, England in 1982. I brought the car to the USA in 2010 and having made the journey from England the car was completely checked and serviced, including a full Engine and Gearbox rebuild. In his introduction to the 1990 Original Classic Car Calendar, in which this car is featured, Stirling Moss reflected on a time when motoring was fun and sums up the pleasure of owning this type of vehicle. A unique car from the days when cars were built with care and devotion by craftsmen.  $64,500 (OBO)"

This car was bought new in Memphis Tn it is been owned by the same family since new. The original owner passed in 2020 and left it to his daughters. It is a factory red car with white interior. A restoration was started but never completed the engine runs good and the transmission shifts good, the rear end is in good shape as well. The car has power brakes and power steering. The paint is in good shape but it is not a show car by any means most of the interior is with the car the seats and carpet arein good shape the door panels are in good shape as is the headliner although a new one is included. It has probably been driven less than 30 miles in the last 25 years. The trim tag is missing but the VIN shows it as a 68 charger R/T with a 440 375 hp engine. All the body panels are original except the quarter panels and they were replaced with panels from Year One. The floor pans and trunk are in good shape there is a couple of small spots that looked to have been patched many years ago. I am a friend of the family and am posting this for them I can send as many pictures as you want of this car. I will be glad to get it up in the air and take pictures of the undercarriage as well. Again this is not a show car it does need to be finished with some work it would be a solid driver but if your looking for a Mecum car or perfection this is not for you. They are negotiable on the price but within reason. Thank you  $75,000 (OBO)"

I have driven it long distances (60 miles round-trip) and even on the highway with no issues. Its only an 18 HP engine so its not quick, but itll get up to 60 mph with some time and a downhill grade helps. This little car gets attention everywhere you go and is so much fun to drive. It has a Clean Colorado Title and No accidents. Exact mileage is unknown but the odometer currently reads 2240. The paint is shiny and looks good but up close in a couple areas it does have some signs of aging or scratches (see photos). There is one spot under the front hood, where the battery is at, that has signs of a small rusted out area (see photos). The left rear chrome nudge bar just broke the other day when I lifted, with my hands, the car up from it (stupid on my part). You can usually find on a few Fiat websites a nice used set (left and right) for $100 shipped or just the left piece new for about $80. Parts are pretty inexpensive to purchase for this car, you just have to wait for shipping from Italy/Europe. No other signs of rusted areas are visible or known to the owner. The rear sometimes leaks a couple drops of fluid after a drive. The oil level is always good on the oil stick and it's only been about 500 miles since the oil was changed. This is the only mechanical issue I didn't dive into and fix. Other than that, the car runs and drives great. - 4 Speed Manual - Rear Wheel Drive - Sunroof - About 40 mpg - New Wheels and Tires (about 200 miles) - I had the following work done by a Classic Fiat mechanic when I received the car: rebuild carburetor and jetted for Denver CO altitude, new gaskets, adjust valves, adjust timing, new points, new condenser, new spark plug cables set, new spark plugs, new ignition coil, new starter, replaced tranny boots, transmission fluid flush, oil change  Approximate Vehicle size: - Length: 10 ft - Width: 4.3 ft - Ground Clearance: 5 in  $12,500 (OBO)"

        "text": "Chevrolet Blazer 1978 $22,000   I originally purchased this vehicle in march of 1997. In around 2006 I started a rebuild which lasted a couple years then really did not bother with it too much other that drive it around the neighborhood a couple times a week. Now that I work out of state I am not home but a couple months of the year so do not do much with it anymore. Asides from things like setting ring gear, rebuild of the engines and transmissions, I did all the work myself. If you are serious about bidding I will be happy to answer any questions you have and send you pictures on request. If you are VERY serious you can arrange to come buy and see it in person. I will be out of the country on vacation from 11/1 until 12/8.  Buyer will have to pick up or arrange for transportation. Title will be signed and keys handed over after funds are clear. If you want to pay cash that is fine. No, I will not accept a personal check o money order. Front Axle: Dana 60 completelyrebuilt with 5:13 gears and Powertrax Locking differential. Dana 70, 35 spline outer stubs Warn manual locking hubs. Has a skyjacker duel steering damper but the bushings need replacing one damper was removed due to bad bushings. These are the only polyurethane bushings that did this on the whole truck. Rear Axle 14 Bolt GM 5:13 gears and Detroitlocker. 3/4 ton front gm calipers and rotors with laser cut brackets There is no parking break, I was planning to install one in the drive line but never got around to it.  Because of the one tone axles I had to install a 1 Ton Master cylinder as the pedal went to the floor. The booster is original and there is no issue, the truck stops REALLY good. I also replaced the rubber caliper hoses with braided steel  Suspension: Super-lift 8\" front and rear springs 1-2\" dopedfront Heavy Duty shackles 2\" blocks in rear (to level truck after lift) Dropped pit manarm and raised steering arm 3\" body lift I cleaned the bottom of the rear axle for ground clearance and build a crossover bracket to relocate the shock mounting points maintaining the same geometry. The front bumper is a little of everything bolted together, the upper portion is removable The Chinese hood is of a thinner gauge steel and was a disappointment though I did reinforce it after it bent on the first closing. The right front fender was also a disappointment and does not appear to line up. I welded in a new passenger rocker panel the came out REALLY nice though I was not happy with the thickness of the China steal. I got rid of a lot of the rust and welded in patch panels for the right bed side above the wheel but was over doing body work at that point.  Interior: Power leather seats were installed from a later model (at the time) Silverado; the tilt on the passenger seat does not work. Because of the heavy boxes I would have rather not built, I had to put in a more narrow back seat from a Wrangler. I have heavily insulated the truck to keep the noise down and the cold air inside. In around 1999 I replaced all the weather striping except for the corner and topper mount windows and all still seems okay.   Auto Meter Gauges: Water temp, Oil Temp, Oil pressure (Mechanical, steel line), Volts, Tachometer, Vacuum I installed a steel oil pressure line because the high pressure oil pump popped three electric senders in a row, this is what prompted the install of gauges. Because I only use to drive it once a week or so I have used two dehumidifiers inside it to keep things from growing Frame was pulled into spec by Four Star Frame and alignment in Hallandale Florida An updated cross member was installed under the engine to facilitate crossover steering with 2wd steering box Two types of frame reinforcement brackets were installed to support the steering box, this was a weak point in the original design. Custom built 1 ton front and rear driveshafts.  Hooker, once ceramic coated headers (installed in 1997), 2 1/2 pipes cut and re cut to accommodate rear springs, Flow master 3 chamber mufflers. Could really use new exhaust  Drive-train: SM465 transmission with NP205 transfer caseand new 10 spine center sleeve, rebuilt beforeinstallation Twin-stick transfer-case shifter, can not be cross-shifted.  Four row, all metal radiator installed in 1998 Because of the body lift I modified fan shroud with fiberglass making a \"plenum\" so the fan is covered with the shroud and pulls more air over the radiator. Two 10 inch fans installed around 1997 on the condenser.   Engine: 350 4 bolt main professionally rebuilt by AccurateMachinein Ft LauderdaleFlorida High capacity oil pan (8 quarts I think) Double roller timing chain Flat top pistons bored30 over Cylinderheads resurfaced Stamped steal roller rocker Edelbroch Performed Cam and intake MSD HEI distributor, coil, and wires  Quadrajet carb All hoses (coolant and fuel) replace during rebuild Fuel sender assemble replaced with new factory unit OE fuel pump, replaced again in 2017 Always kept tank full.\\ The battery was relocated to the rear of the truck and I installed a master shutoff. There are constant hot wires that lead under the dash along with an extra fuse box over the accelerator pedal. The battery cable going to the starter is 00 gauge (too thick, not practical). I built a supplemental relay box under the hood with the idea of installing lights, a winch, or whatever in the future.  Known Issues: Front windshield cracked. Leaking rear axle seals AC Compressor front seal leaks, It is an A6 so you may want to have something lighter installed or just have the seal replaced. The bushings in the steering damper disintegrated but oddly enough none of the others have. Can set off other people's car alarms when driving through parking lots    $22,000"

The last thing I did was have the original wheels re-powder coated and new Cooper tires installed . I have recently completed a lot of work and it is running great except for some rust issues over the doors I was addressing but have not completed. You will need to complete the body work and some odds and ends here and there. The only real issue I have ever had was this car likes to eat IAC motors for some reason. It may be an problem with the wiring harness but have never got so far to figure it out. Another nuisance is the A/C only works on Max Cold as the blend door motor was stuck on heat so I unplugged it and persuaded it to remain on cold. This can be fixed if you decide to dissect the dash board as the engineers started with the actuator and then built the car around it. Overall I have always strived to keep it OE with the only exception being the test pipes temporary installed to diagnose an exhaust back pressure issue.  As I do work out of state, I will arrange to meet the buyer at my home for the transaction. I will be on vacation between 11/1 to 12/8   Originally purchased in November of 2001 with 40,000 miles, I was the second owner. Oil changes performed every 3000 miles, synthetic oil used. Transmission fluid changed every 20,000 miles. Vehicle was painted 2 times since purchase and is due to be painted again. Vehicle stored under car cover with dehumidifier inside while I am out of town. The majority of recent work has been listed below along with some items as far back as 2019 Air suspension has been maintained over the years.

        "text": "Ford Bronco 1968 $125,000 (OBO)  1968 Bronco high end restoration, uncut, frame offrotisserie, no expenses spared, professionally done with no rust or cover ups. This is my 5th Bronco restoration that I have done in the last 7years and by far this is the best one. It was to be my personal Bronco that I planned on driving for a long timeso a lot of special details and money went into it. This was a 2-year project. Unfortunately I had to have multiple surgeries and the last one this year was ashoulder replacementso it doesn't allow me to enjoy the vehicle as I had planned. It has less than500 miles since it was built. I have been building cars for 50 years and it is my passion. My team consisted of 2 other guys with extreme automotive experience who worked with me on all my Bronco builds. We thought about putting a Coyote motor in but after talking to friends who have purchased classics with Coyote motors and realized the problems that come with the modification that most people do not talk about in a vehicle this size. Some of our acquaintances have rolled the vehicle due to excessive power and short wheel base and height as well as some twists in the frame so this made me decide to put in the 289, which is reliable, with the upgrades giving it approximately the same horsepower as a 302. With the 5 speed it is super fun and very responsive, all the power that an older classic Bronco needs to enjoy this truck to the maximum (these motors were very reliable). The crate motor I put in was a long block with a RV cam and had only 6,000 miles on it. It came to me painted red and I repainted it in the Ford blue and replaced all the outer components as listed below. Out of all the Broncos I had this one drives, steers and handles as well as my new Ford pickup. I wanted it to have a good clean look, no side markers, no side trim and extra insulated for it to be very quiet when driving, not a rattlebox. The smaller tire size that it is photographed in is so that the wheels stay inside the fender wells which is one of the reasons why it steers and handles well. There is plenty of fender clearance for these wheels as well as the extra set of larger wheels that come with it which will protrude1 1/2 inches outside the fenders (see details below).You will not find another one that looks like this, clean, simple, retro inside, custom engine bay and totally restored bumper to bumper. Has always been in a heated garage.I have all the photos and receipts on the build from start to finish. I have the original side glass for the top and 2 brand new chrome side mirrors for the doors if desired. If you are seriously interested please contact me with any questions andI will send you videos of it running and driving. Shipping transport should be enclosed and from Missoula, MT.  The following parts are all new unless stated rebuilt: Body: front fenders, hood, grill, door skins, rear tail light housing (welded in no seams for a cleaner look), tailgate, inner fenders, complete glass, window hardware upgraded kit no wing windows no noise, 3 coats of 3M rubber undercoating including fenders, custom rock guards inside fenders, fuel tanks, fill necks, stainless steel gas lines, skid plate, bumpers front and rear, stainless steel step bar and rock guards, Biminihalf top, custom side windows tinted with flush mount slide vent, chrome license plate holder, chrome exterior door handles, tailgate (all new internal workings with cable rods) and inside handles, weatherstripping, keys and locks door jams, floor pans, approximately $2,000 stainless steel bolts, hydraulic hood and rear window lifts, new red Hi Jack spare tire jack. Tub was replaced with a newer refurbished tub. Paint: 2 coats of primer sealer, 4 coats of color - wet sanded after each coat, 3 coats of clear, cut and buffed. All work was done in my shop.

        "text": "Lincoln Continental Mark V 1979 $18,500 (OBO)  1979 Mark V For Sale 1979 was the last year of production for the famous Lincoln Continental Mark V, the last American Rolls Royce ever built in America! This is one of only 2040 produced in the white Collectors Series (with no opera windows) and 36,000 original documented miles. The car is stunning inside and out, straight as an arrow, stops on a dime and literally seems to float on the road, no squeaks or rattles whatsoever on a brick road with speed humps... nor any fluid leaks! Its amazingly easy to drive, not to mention the turning heads and constant little comments and conversations no matter where you go New tires, battery, starter, relay, battery ground cable, belts, (it still had the original factory Motorcraft), hoses, heater control valve, fuel filter, air filter, master brake cylinder, windshield washer pump, wiper blades, all fluids changed, recored radiator, A/C conversion to R- 134 (not working properly yet),rebuilt carburetor and any other issues related to safety and comfort were addressed and taken care of. The brakes are in excellent condition with 8 mm. on the front and 6mm. in the rear with a very long life, I have the report form Tires Plus as well as several other repair documentation. The blue velvet-like cloth interior (which was an option over leather at the time), is still in excellent condition and the front power bucket seats are super comfy that can be adjusted with the six-way power settings (the passenger side has some issues with the tilt). Between the seats is a huge (and unworn!) armrest with plenty of storage underneath (for your 8-Tracks!) and a center console with its original 40 Channel CB Radio, two handheld mics and a perfectly working power antenna people freak out when you raise it at a red light! The Cartier clock has a bit a mind of its own as well as the fuel to empty, and the 8-Track stereo sounds muffled. The car still wears its original paint and pin stripes, and the body is rust free with only few cosmetic blemishes. The undercarriage does show some surface rust which is very common as the chassis were never painted from factory at the time, otherwise the car is rock solid throughout. This car is loaded with every possible option available at the time except for a moon roof and the drivers side rear view mirror with thermometer. I had the car inspected by Lemon Squad before my purchase and was pleasantly surprised by their report. This Mark V was specially ordered by its first owner in Georgia (see plate on passenger side dash) who was a Ford collector and then passed it on to his son who preserved its condition. The car has been carefully detailed inside and out including the engine bay, new under the hood insulation and new door strikers; it had a doughnut spare which had melted over the years and was replaced it with a full-size spare as the car is very heavy. I am a realtor here in Saint Petersburg, Florida, (Tampa Bay Area), best airports are Tampa or Clearwater. Please feel free to contact me for any queries you may have, inspections, test drive, more pictures, etc. Hope to see you soon!... at the airport!  and who knows, if the car is not for you, maybe I'll find you a lovely home here on the Gulf of Mexico!    $18,500 (OBO)"

The document package included all maintenance records and Heritage Certificate from original owner. I was assured by the E&R representative that it was a good solid car and all systems were working fine and it was ready to drive. But as it goes with on-line purchases, there are always issues to be resolved. The first drive proved that all systems were working fine, all gages working, good oil pressure, good brakes and no unusual sounds. However, therewere issues to get the car to where I feel confident to take it on the road. The project entailed being a serious MOSS MOTORS customer. I replaced the wiring harness with a new fabric cover system. Also replaced battery cables, new dash switches, solenoid, voltage regulator and a battery cutoff switch. Converted to negative ground and replaced tach with proper negative ground type. Externally I replaced grill (the previous ownerhad painted the vertical bars). The shiny grill made the bumpers look dull, so I replaced front and rear bumpers and overriders. Added auxiliary hood release. Replaced exhaust with stainless steel system. Replaced weatherstripping on doors and hatch along with window channels, vent window seals, rider and driver window glass (had scratches on originals) and rebuilt regulators. Replaced both windshield wheel box assemblies along with new wiper arms and blades. Sand blasted, primed and painted all five wire wheels. Replaced front rotors and pads. In the interior, I added sound deadening on floors and replaced all carpeting. The seats were rebuilt with new diaphragms, new foam and black leather with red piping. Same for rear seat. For the engine compartment, I added aluminum radiator, replaced fan and hub, replaced all hoses, clamps and grommets forwater, oil and fuel. Replaced heater control valve and all control cables. All removeable pieces were sandblasted, primed and painted with all new hardware. It was a busy year getting this MGB GT ready. I am retired and enjoy working an cars and getting them to a point where I feel confident and proud to drive them. In my early years I had a blue 67, a primrose 71 and a damask 74. I ordered it early after seeing the pictures of the new rubber bumper model, soI was able to get chrome bumpers. All were GT models as I like the style. That followed with muscle cars, street rods and classics. My problem now is I had recent back surgery which limits my ability to do these projects so I must sell. I am located in Central Virginia and the car is always keptin a conditioned garage. I have documentation of all work that I have done as well as manuals and various leftover parts that I purchased while doing the work. While this is not a Concourse grade car, it is a quality dependable car for taking to local shows and fun drives.  $25,000"

        "text": "Chevrolet Corvette 2010 $43,000 (OBO)  POWERTRAIN With the V-8 engine from the base Corvette, but the suspension setup, brakes and styling cues of the higher-performance Z06, the Grand Sport is effectively another trim level of the Corvette. The optional dual-mode exhaust system, which added $1,195 to the price of our test car, bumps the V-8s output to 436 hp. The Grand Sports brakes are particularly well executed. They are shared with the high-performance Corvette Z06 and feature 14-inch front and 13.4-inch rear cross-drilled rotors gripped by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers. The Grand Sport uses a suspension setup similar to the Z06s, as well as wider alloy wheels and tires  9.5 inches in front and 12 inches in back. Under the hood is the original LS3 V8, rated at 436 horsepower at 5,900 rpm and 424 lb-ft of torque at 4,600 rpm when new. Maintaining the smooth power band of the 6.2-liter engine is easy thanks to the efficient paddle-shifted six-speed automatic transmission. Reviews from its launch state that the car could reach 60 mph in 4 seconds, with a top speed of 190 mph. EXTERIOR This Grand Sport is covered in brilliant Torch Red. The paint is flawless with a clay bar smooth finish. The Grand Sport option is noted on chrome inserts above the vents just behind the front wheels. A tasteful body colored rear spoiler was professionally installed in addition to several interior and exterior carbon fiber-look accents ($5000). The engine compartment is stock and pristine. The car includes the optional glass top. All the glass is in excellent shape with a professional tint applied and the doors seal tightly with no wind noise or leaks. INTERIOR The Light Cashmere leather interior is in like new condition and thanks to the 2LT Preferred Equipment Group option features a few more bells and whistles than a standard model. These options include heated sport memory seats with power bolsters and lumbar support and a premium nine-speaker Bose radio that accepts CDs and offers Bluetooth connectivity. All the gauges, heads-up display, dual-zone climate control, and control switches and accessories function properly. CHASSIS The Grand Sport option features a wider track (with wide-body styling), revised shocks, stiffer springs, and firmer stabilizer bars to provide even better handling than base model Corvettes. Original chrome wheels holding Nitto Invo tires. Optional dual-mode performance exhaust ($1195) adds an extra 6 hp. The Grand Sports brakes are particularly well executed. Theyre shared with the high-performance Corvette Z06 and feature 14-inch front and 13.4-inch rear cross-drilled rotors gripped by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers. The Grand Sport uses a suspension setup similar to the Z06s, as well as wider alloy wheels and tires  9.5 inches in front and 12 inches in back DOCUMENTATION The seller states that this vehicle will be sold on a clean Texas title in his name. This 2010 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport Coupe was purchased when only 3 months old with 6000 miles and has remained in current owners possession ever since. Since then, the car has only been used for pleasure driving. The sale will include all factory manuals and custom cover. The owner admits to not driving the car as often as he should and would prefer to see this Grand Sport Vette being enjoyed on the road instead of sitting in his garage.  $43,000 (OBO)"

Immaculate Camaro medium orange code 78 factory paint color. Paint is Flawless, not one scratch. This is a turn Key ready Camaro, all stock original from the factory. See work done and new parts as listed below. This beauty is ready for another 47 years and will only increase in value. One too many hotrods, forced to sell this beautiful ride. Safeties/certified. Not a numbers matching car, original engine L22 - 250 cu in has been upgraded to a high HP 350 cu in engine. Car is tight; braking, suspension, steering, strong engine, strong transmission with no body or suspension squeaks anywhere while driving. Drives like new! No accidents, all seams excellent, correct from the factory. With 20 years of storage this car needed some love and care. I purchased the car because it has a sound frame, undercarriage and had no rust on the body. Mechanicals, worn components, worn rubber and paint clear coat peel can all be addressed, a rotten frame or body cannot. I have owned 10 previous classic cars. Therefore, I know what to look for in a solid classic car. I had a vision of what this car could be and believe the Z28 accents add value to the look of the car. I targeted a black on orange contrast. You be the judge! The following has been done in the last 8 months by me and my selected automotive partners:  This is a 45k mile car. Original interior, sheet metal all solid outside and inside (all metal car), Underbody excellent, Frame excellent, original wheel wells, doors, fenders, rocker panels, rear frame rails, no rust anywhere, strong 350 cu in/ transmission. All gauges, lights, turn signals functioning as they should (including clock!). A true 45K mile car. Note: MPH on Speedo, this is a US car in origin (If a Canadian car it would be in Kilometers). This car somehow at sometime made its way up to Canada from the USA. Most likely a southern US car because of no rust on the body. Please see all photos and video with the ad. Lets remind ourselves that GMs quality in 1976 was not like it is today. This is a 47 year old car, thus the car comes with its quirks and quality from the factory.  Fraser MacDuffee  $35,500 (OBO)"

This breathtaking 1959 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible is in amazing condition inside and out. It is truly a one-of-a-kind show stopper. This was the personal car of a very good friend of mine right here in Scottsdale, AZ. He wanted the nicest, most unique, jaw-dropping Cadillac on the road, and money was no object. It needed to be a '59 Caddy convertible, so I found him the nicest fully restored 1959 Cadillac I could find. He then took it to one of the best custom shops in town and had it equipped with the top-of-the-line computerized air ride system, custom-ordered 22 polished billet Colorado Custom wheels that were created to match the style of the original Cadillac hubcaps, wrapped with custom 22-inch whitewall tires. They finished it off with a completely hidden, insane sound system. The tasteful modifications were done to keep the car's original look but give it a modern twist. The result is a stunning boulevard cruiser that no exotic can match! This was a solid, rust-free car from the start that was completely restored from front to back. Finished in beautiful Seminole Red with all show-quality chrome and trim. Even the entire front and rear billet grilles were completely taken apart and restored. The sides are straight as an arrow with excellent fit and finish. The interior was completely redone in correct red and white and looks amazing against the matching red paint finish. All the chrome inside the car is beautiful, with a perfect dash and fully restored steering wheel and a perfect horn ring. Inside the trunk, it was finished wonderfully in matching red as well. It has a new white soft top with a matching top boot. It just doesn't get any better than this. When he built this car the way he wanted it, he did it with preservation in mind and kept all the original parts to put the car right back to stock if you ever decide to do so. This is just an awesome cruiser that is so much fun to drive. Drop the top, throw your favorite tunes on from your phone, pick up your friends, and have the time of your life cruising this baby on the weekends. I've owned all the exotics, luxury cars you can imagine, and they do not compare to the fun you have in a vintage bagged Caddy like this!

Finished in a beautiful shade of yellow, with the iconic Road Runner animations and horn, this Satellite has been revamped and renovated into a Road Runner with a 383 V8 with Coyote Duster air system. Other upgrades under the hood include an Edelbrock Eliminator intake manifold, Mopar Performance valve covers, electronic ignition system, MSD wiring and much more. Paired to the engine is a rebuilt 727 automatic transmission which feels smooth while shifting. Outside, the yellow paint shines brightly after a fresh polishing in the Lupo Auto Salon, the Magnum wheels look great with white lettered Mastercraft tires, and the black accents add a nice satin touch. Inside, the all black with wood trim interior shows very nicely. The leather seats appear to be in very good condition and feel comfortable. In the dash sits a Kenwood head unit, paired to Diamond Audio Technology speakers and a Kicker Amplifier in the rear of the car. If you are interested in a Mopar to truly enjoy, this Satellite turned Road Runner appears to be an excellent choice.

The truck was repainted green and fitted with a rebuilt 2.25-liter diesel engine as part of a refurbishment completed in Spain in 2018. It is said to have been subsequently imported to the US and was purchased by the prior owner in 2019. Equipment includes a four-speed transmission, a dual-range transfer case, 16 steel wheels, disc brakes, a tan removable soft top, and seating for six. The truck was refinished in green during the refurbishment and features a tan removable soft top with roll-up sides as well as a split windshield, sliding side windows, dual fender-mounted mirrors, and a galvanized front bumper, door hinges, and hood hinges. Body-color 16 steel wheels wear 205/80 Insa Turbo Special Track-2 tires, and a spare steel wheel with a matching tire is stored against the bulkhead in the rear cargo area. Braking is handled by discs at all four corners. The cab features bucket seats upholstered in black vinyl along with color-coordinated door panels and all-weather floor mats. Equipment includes cowl vents, a center console, two cup holders, and push-button operation for the glow plugs and ignition. A metal bulkhead separates the cab from the cargo area. The banjo-style steering wheel fronts a body-color dashboard housing a Veglia-Bressel 120-km/h speedometer and a Smiths combination gauge for coolant temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 84k kilometers (~52k miles), and true mileage is unknown. The cargo area features four fold-away jump seats, two storage compartments, and an all-weather floor liner. The 2.25-liter diesel inline-four was reportedly rebuilt in 2018. Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Repairs and patches are visible on the frame. Recent maintenance in September 2023, included the following: removed and replaced real axle seals, and transmission seals.  $52,000 (OBO)"

This MINT 2013 McLarenSpider MP4-12C hard-top convertible establishes McLaren as a legitimate player in the elite world of track-ready supercars. This 12C Spider has Vorsteiner (LOOK IT UP!) carbon fiber accents throughout the car - rear spoiler/wing, side skirts, vents, CLEAR PROTECTIVE WRAP, incredible stereo w/ nav, and more. A mid-mounted V8 engine that now makes over 615horsepower is at the heart of the McLarens enviable performance figures, while a supple 2-seat interior and a surprisingly refined ride help make this quarter-million-dollar car more livable than others in its rarified air. Low miles, immaculately taken care of, never has been on a track, and serviced at an authorized McLaren dealer since purchased new. Read the following to understand why this listing is a screaming buy, beautiful car, and the reason I've owned it for five years vs. getting something else! Driving The Used 2013 McLaren MP4-12C Even with all its power and performance abilities, the MP4-12C can be a tame beast when you want it to be. Its a supercar that wont fuss about trips to the market. In \"normal\" mode, the chassis quells rough roads with ease. Switch to \"sport\" or \"track\" settings, though, and the McLaren becomes another car. Suddenly, its compliant ride and smooth shifts from the 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission are replaced by a ferocity that leaves no doubt about the racecars that inspired the 12C. Turbo lag from the compact V8 engine is nearly nonexistent. The McLaren 12C spiderhas a 0-60 mph time of 3.10seconds. The MP4 corners with devastating precision and makes even novice drivers look good thanks to a system that applies brakes when needed to help keep you  and the car  in one piece. Interior Comfort Getting into the McLaren via the upward-opening doors are a nice touch since it allows you to sit on the doorsill before settling into the low designed drivers seat. Once inside, though, the car is quite comfortable. The two seats are appropriately bolstered, and to McLarens credit there is even cargo space on a bench behind the seats in addition to the cavity up front near the bumper (remember, this is a mid-engine car). Directly in front of the driver is the large oval instrumentation that will let you know when youre traveling at jail speeds. This Spider modelfeature a rear glass panel that can be lowered to let in more engine noise in the cabin along with fresh air when the top is up. Exterior Styling The McLaren has more curves than a supermodel and skin as scintillating as one. Massive air intakes define the MP4s sides, while even the vertical-opening doors are a work of design magic. Up front, long and trapezoidal headlights are reminiscent of Ferraris, and the rear boasts high-mounted exhausts that howl from above, not below, the bumper. The McLarens mid-mounted V8 heart, meanwhile, is displayed under a panel of glass for all to see. Spider models have a 2-piece retractable hardtop and dual-purpose tonneau that protects the retracted roof or, with the roof up, covers a small cargo space. My Favorite Features LUXURY RIDE QUALITY FOLDING HARD TOP Standard Features The  Factory Options The McLaren can be taken to even higher heights with carbon-ceramic brakes (nearly $14,000 alone), power-adjustable seats, parking sensors, custom interior trims including Alcantara, an upgraded audio system with satellite navigation, and exterior bits that include carbon-fiber engine panels. An upgraded exhaust system thats lighter and louder than the standard one can be had for even more aural pleasure. A \"Stealth Pack\" doesnt make the car invisible, but rather finishes the rear airbrake and exhaust pipe in a polished metallic finish, with the aim of giving the 12C a more aggressive rear. Engine & Transmission The heart of every McLaren MP4-12C is a twin-turbo V8 engine that has now been tuned to make  Car is located in Auburn AL (30 min. from Columbus GA).

This car is more than just a vehicle, it's a piece of history, a testament to the golden age of automotive design. It's not just a car, it's a lifestyle, a statement, a symbol of elegance and sophistication. This beautiful machine has been lovingly cared for by three owners, all of whom have kept it safely tucked away in a garage, preserving its charm and character. It has a new exhaust system including new chrome pipes.Its sleek silver exterior, a $5,000.00 recent paint job addition, gleams like a moonbeam, turning heads wherever it goes. Under the hood, the engine purrs like a well-fed cat, with a compression of 150 psi in five of the six cylinders and 145 psi in the remaining one. The tires, though not brand new, still have plenty of life left in them, with 5/32 tread on the front from 2000 and 8/32 on the rear from 2005. The brake pads and rotors are in good condition, ensuring a smooth and safe ride. However, like any classic car, it has its quirks. There are small oil leaks, some radiator corrosion, and the idler arm bushing shows some wear. The interior is a sight to behold, with excellent leather seats that cradle you in comfort. The back of the driver seat is coming loose, but it's a minor issue that should be easy to fix. The front passenger carpet shows fraying. The odometer is inoperable, showing 2050 miles, but we believe it has likely rolled over to 102,050 miles. The car runs beautifully, but does experience some stalling when coming to a stop, which we suspect may be a fuel pump issue. Despite these minor issues, this car is a gem, a true classic that will bring joy to any car enthusiast. This car comes with a treasure trove of original documents, including the maintenance manual from the first owner, the original Mercedes-Benz dealer's book from October 15, 1971, the maintenance booklet, the owner's manual, and the Mercedes-Benz 1970 catalog. This car is being sold on behalf of a dear friend who unfortunately passed away in a motorcycle accident. His widow has made the difficult decision to part with this beautiful machine. This is a unique opportunity to own a piece of automotive history, and to continue the legacy of care and love that this car has always known. This 1972 Mercedes 280 SE is more than just a car. It's a statement, a lifestyle, a piece of history and would be considered in between excellent and good condition. It's waiting for the right person to write the next chapter of its story. Could that person be you?  $15,000"

These go anywhere trucks had the ability to traverse rough terrain with ease and had reliability that was second to none. The FJ40 was produced for over two decades, from 1960 to 1983, with various updates and changes made over the years. It has gained a loyal following among off-road enthusiasts and collectors, who appreciate its rugged, no-nonsense design and its ability to handle the toughest driving conditions. This 1968 Toyota FJ40 is a beautifully restored truck complete with a bare metal refinish is gorgeous red! Youll find more of that gorgeous red paint on the interior as well as a set of functional gauges, recovered seats, refinished interior trim, a restored steering wheel and new rubber trim throughout.

The transmission is a 3-speed and shifts smoothly through the gears. She has fresh fluids throughout and we just performed a tune up. This is a great truck to drive around town and about as reliable as they get! Also, incredible for farm and light offroad use.

With its updated styling, upscale interior, and six speed manual transmission, it is a top choice for fans of wind-in-your-hair motoring. Engine The engine is the iconic 2.0L four cylinder that now, with the Turbo option, cranks an extremely healthy 200 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque. However, the fuel economy is even more impressive, surpassing those of the base model with 21 City and 30 Hwy MPG. The easily shifting six-speed manual transmission rates as one of the best of its type. Driving The 2013 Volkswagen Beetle Convertible is an enjoyable car to drive, particularly with the Turbo engine under the hood. It handles very solidly, especially with the sport-tuned suspension that underpins the Turbo model. Safety  Standard safety features include antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control and combination head/thorax front side airbags. Also, standard are roll bars behind the rear seats that pop up in a fraction of a second in a crash. Interior The bucket seats are comfortable with excellent bolstering and ample legroom. A noteworthy characteristic of this model is that the soft top now folds lower atop the rear deck, that improves rear visibility considerably. The convertible top folds down in less than 10 seconds. The trunk has 7.1 cubic feet of space, that can be expanded by flipping down one or both halves of the 50/50-split rear seatbacks.  $9,950 (OBO)"

It was originally delivered to Wright Nissan in Wexford, Pennsylvania and has remained unmodified throughout its life. Equipment includes removable glass T-tops, four-wheel anti-lock power disc brakes, speed-sensitive power steering, and quad exhaust outlets. Finished in Super White over a charcoal gray cloth interior, this Z32 300ZX is now offered with extra keys, owner's manuals, a window sticker, T-top storage bags, a clean CARFAX report, and a clear title in the seller's name. The Super White (code 326) exterior features integrated fog lamps, removable glass T-tops, a power antenna, quad exhaust outlets, and a rear windshield wiper. Aluminum five-spoke 16-inch wheels are wrapped in 225/50 GT Radial Champiro UHP tires that were installed earlier this year. The right rear wheel shows signs of curb damage. The two-seat cockpit has dual charcoal cloth bucket seats with patterned inserts, matched to the door panels, upholstered dash, center console, carpeting, and Z-branded floor mats.

The VG30DE 3.0-liter, 24-valve V6 was rated at 222 horsepower and 198 lb-ft of torque when new. An oil change was performed in May 2023. Power is fed to the rear wheels via a console-shifted four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. A four-wheel alignment and a brake inspection were performed earlier this year. Stopping power comes from vented anti-lock disc brakes. The suspension uses a four-wheel independent multi-link setup.

A Pennsylvania emissions inspection was performed in March 2023. The sale includes extra keys, owners manuals, T-top storage bags, and a window sticker showing an original retail price of $36,509.  $15,500"

IF YOURE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING PLEASE REGISTER TO BID DIRECTLY WITH BRING-A-TRAILER. ITS A QUICK AND SIMPLE PROCESS. PLEASE CALL WITH ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1987-porsche-911-turbo-coupe-34/ This amazing and fully documented 1987 Porsche 911 Turbo with 31,000 original miles is a great example of a highly collectable European Sports Car. This car is a documented two owner vehicle with a clean Car Fax report. The 930 Turbo 3.3L was produced from 1978-1989 totaling 18,770 units worldwide. For the 1978 model year, Porsche revised the 930 with a larger 3.3-liter turbocharged engine with intercooler rated at 282hp. To fit the intercooler a newly designed tea-tray tail spoiler replaced the earlier whale tail spoiler. Porsche dropped the Carrera nomenclature for the North American markets and the car was simply called the Porsche 911 Turbo worldwide. The larger engine helped reduce some of the turbo lag inherent in the earlier models. As the original factory window sticker documents this example was ordered and shipped to Ogner Motorcars, Inc. located in Woodland Hills, CA. It was ordered with a Silver Metallic exterior and Black leather interior. It was also ordered with an electric sunroof and limited slip differential. As the original Motor Vehicle Purchase Order, original Odometer Statement and original Due Bill document it was purchased on July 7th, 1987 by Robert Faust who lived in Sherman Oaks, CA. A receipt of payment made in full was issued on July 20th, 1987. Robert was an excellent caretaker and always maintained the car properly which is documented with 16 service invoices from 1987-2007. Robert moved to New Mexico in July of 2006 which is indicated on the original New Mexico title. On March 2, 2007 Robert decided to sell the car with 26,081 original miles to Willhoit Enterprises which was a used automotive dealership located in Springfield, MO. This is also documented on the original New Mexico title. On March 20th, 2007 the car was sold to Michael Foley who lives in Bristol, RI which is documented with the original Retail Buyers Order. On April 22, 2007 Michael sent the car to Musante Motorsprorts located in South Windsor, CT for a complete service. Musante Motorsports is well-known and respected in the Porsche community. Musante Motorsports suggested an engine out service which is extensive. Some of the service also included some upgraded parts. As the service invoices document Michael invested a total of $30,291.75 in parts and labor which he didnt mind because he was going to keep the car along time. He had the car dyno tested and as the dyno sheet documents it put down 375hp at the rear tires! Michael was also an excellent caretaker and always maintained the car properly. During the next 16 years Michael only used the car on special occasions averaging roughly 300 miles per year. It was stored in his garage on a car lift and was covered with a battery tender. During his time of ownership he found the original owner Robert Fausts wallet under the seat. The wallet contained his license, 1 Admirals Club card, 3 credit cards, 2 California registrations and 3 insurance cards. Michael tried reaching out to Rober to return the wallet and learned Robert had passed. Michael kept the wallet and everything in it which is included. Michael is now retired and in his 70s. He and his wife are moving down south closer to family so he decided to sell the car. Michael contacted MS CLASSIC CARS about purchasing the vehicle before listing it for sale. MS CLASSIC CARS jumped on the opportunity and purchased the car in September of 2023.  Best Offer"

        "text": "Ford GT 2021 $1,025,000  The second generation Ford GT was conceptualized as both a testament to innovation and a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the original GT40's historic 1-2-3 victory at Le Mans in 1966. Ford intended not just to produce a supercar that paid homage to its predecessor but to eclipse it with cutting-edge technology and performance. The development began in secret, under the code name \"Project Phoenix,\" spearheaded by a small group of Ford engineers and designers committed to recapturing the glory of the GT's heritage. Their efforts came to light in 2015 when Ford stunned the automotive world with the unveiling of the all-new GT at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. With a design that was aerodynamically sculpted for maximum efficiency and a nod to the original GT40, the new GT was a striking blend of history and futuristic vision.  Production of the second generation Ford GT started in December 2016, with a plan for a limited run, making it an exclusive supercar emphasizing performance and collectibility. It was outfitted with a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 engine, which was a departure from the traditional V8. Yet, it delivered a formidable 647 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque, further increased to 660 horsepower starting in the 2020 model year. This powerhouse was encased in a carbon fiber monocoque chassis, draped in a sleek, aerodynamically optimized body that paid homage to its ancestors while breaking ground with its efficiency and downforce generation. Ford utilized the most advanced materials and engineering techniques of the time, ensuring that the second-generation GT set a new benchmark for American supercars in terms of performance, technology, and design. With its active aerodynamics, pushrod suspension, and a top speed of over 200 miles per hour, the GT was not just a tribute to the past; it was a bold stride into the future of automotive excellence.  The 2021 Ford GT offered here presents in immaculate, like-new condition, showing a mere 29 miles on the odometer. Nearly $50,000 worth of desirable options further enhance this example's appeal, including the Dark Energy interior upgrade package, a comprehensive cabin overhaul that adds boundless carbon fiber and alluring black finishes. The leather-wrapped F1-inspired steering wheel, Sparco carbon fiber racing seats trimmed with black Alcantara, matte carbon instrument bezels, and anodized black aluminum shift paddles complete the dark, jet-fighter interior. Outside, the car is finished in Frozen White with optional Lightning Blue stripes, a livery that evokes Ford's racing history in an immediately recognizable fashion. Matching blue-painted Brembo brake calipers are mounted over ventilated and cross-drilled carbon ceramic rotors, appearing as jewels under the 20\" satin silver wheels. On the road or the track, the speed-activated splitter and deployable rear wing keep downforce high, while the push-button front lift system makes day-to-day navigation simple. Offered here with special permission from Ford, this example represents a rare opportunity to own a virtually brand-new GT.

        "text": "Ford GT 2006 $495,000  The first generation Ford GT was born to celebrate Ford's centennial and simultaneously resurrect its legendary performance racing history. Conceived in 2002, the development of this iconic sports car was spearheaded by Ford's then-Vice President of Design, J Mays. The design took inspiration from the historic Ford GT40, the legendary race car that achieved an impressive four consecutive wins at Le Mans from 1966 to 1969, defying Ferrari's dominance. The team aimed not just to echo the GT40's aesthetic appeal but to craft a modern supercar that could stir the souls of car enthusiasts and honor the original's legacy. By mid-2003, a concept version had been unveiled, stunning the public with its faithful yet fresh reinterpretation of the GT40's timeless design.  Manufacture of the first generation Ford GT commenced in 2004, with the first deliveries taking place the same year. The car was engineered to be a high-performance machine and a road-legal sports car, a dual character that required an exquisite balance of power, handling, and aerodynamics. It featured a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 engine, which produced an impressive 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Crafted with an aluminum body and equipped with a sophisticated suspension system, the GT was a showcase of Ford's advanced technology and commitment to driving excellence. Its production, however, was limited; over two years, only around 4,000 units were built, making it an instant classic. The GT's blend of performance and exclusivity solidified its place in the pantheon of great American sports cars.  The 2006 Ford GT offered here shows just over 3,700 miles on the clock and has remained with one owner since new; its exceptional condition is a testament to the owner's meticulous care. It is finished in Centennial White with optional blue racing stripes over an Ebony leather interior, perhaps the most iconic and well-known GT combination. Outside, the optional lightweight forged aluminum wheels are complemented by gray-painted brake calipers mounted over the massive ventilated and cross-drilled rotors. Inside the sleek, rocket ship interior, bolstered sport seats trimmed in Ebony leather ensure the occupants stay firmly put even at breakneck speeds while the optional McIntosh sound system provides entertainment. Rarely does a first-generation example of this caliber present itself, and this example checks every box for the discerning collector.

        "text": "Lincoln Continental 1962 $135,000  From the beginning in 1940 the Lincoln Continental was always a high quality and very good looking sporty car originally designed by Edsel Fords own personal use. It was so good looking that all of his friends wanted one which pushed him to move it into production. Fast-forwarding to 1958,Lincoln made a bold move in switching to unitary construction for the 1958 models, but the result was somewhat underwhelming. The largest Lincolns to date and the hugest unibody cars ever, they came across as massive and interesting, competitive at first but pretty dated by 1960. The new, clean design for 1961 started out as a Thunderbird concept and so it wascreated around a Thunderbird cowl. But it was Robert McNamara, Ford general manager and future company president, who suggested it become a four-door Lincoln Continental. This caused quite a stir, since an evolutionary Lincoln, based on the 1958-60 design, was already in process. But Engel's design prevailed, and went into production in November 1960. The Industrial Design Institute awarded it a coveted Bronze Medal which is very difficult to achieve for an automobile. 15 inches shorter than its predecessor, the new Continental was designed for ease of passenger entry: the lack of a wrap-around windshield and use of \"suicide\" rear doors aided in this. And truly modern for the time was a four-door convertible body style. Offered here  $135,000"

Beginning production in 1953 with the iconic 100-4, Austin Healeys 4 cylinder model which proved to be extremely popular for both roadand racing purposes. After a while Donald Healey just couldn'tsqueeze any more power out of his trusty Austin 4 cylinder so he upgraded to a straight six cylinder overhead valve Austin unit with twin SU H6 carburetors producing 130 horsepower, a huge upgrade from the previous 4 cylinder engine. The 100-6 proved to be extremely popular becoming the basis for the iconic 3000 to follow. The 3000 proved to be even more popular and much more refined than its predecessors. The overhead valve six was upgraded yet again now 3 liters versus the 2.6 liter engine in the 100-6. he most refined version and arguably the best came in 1965 with the BJ8 MKIII. These had 150 horsepower over the previous 136 horsepower in the MKII with a bore size of 2 inches and a higher lift camshaft. These also had a wood grained dash board, a 4 speed transmission with overdrive and roll up windows. These were the best road going Healeys. Offered here is one of these great BJ8 MKIIIs that is a very solid original car that is well sorted and is rust free. Finished in red with black coves, this late 3000 is really sharp. Everything works as it should including the overdrive. It has recently been treated to a mechanical service with a new clutch, throwout bearing and rear main seal. It runs and drives incredibly well and is fitted with aa stainless steel exhaust that gives an incredible tone. If you are looking for a great, well sorted BJ8 MKIII than this car should certainly be considered.  $40,000"

The car is painted in the factory color code S (Medium Gold Metallic), and the interior has been changed from the original Nugget-colored interior to a cloth animal print. This Continental comes with power seats, locks, windows, and the trademark suicide rear-hinged doors. The car's odometer shows 39,260 miles, but the total mileage is unknown. This Lincoln is currently located in Chicago, Illinois. The third-party photos of the car show a straight body with clean lines. The car does show some rust on the lower left rear quarter panel and front bumper, and surface rust is present underneath the vehicle. There is also a paint defect on the right fender, and the photos show a cracked fan shroud. A third-party inspection of the car was performed and found that the interior is in good condition despite a tear in the headliner. The inspection also notes that the tire tread depth should also be monitored. All power features in the interior are said to be functioning properly. A video of the engine running smoothly is included in the report. Overall the car is a good candidate for some exterior reconditioning or for the next owner to enjoy as it is. Included in the sale are two sets of keys. This Lincoln Continental is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Chicago, IL. Financing options are available through our recommended lenders. Please find options here.  About the model The fourth generation Lincoln Continental was introduced for the 1961 model year. The fourth-generation Continental is one of Lincoln's most well-known cars, featuring prominently in pop culture. Lincoln consolidated their model lineup in 1961, making the Continental their only model. The fourth-generation Continentals were available as sedans, coupes, or four-door convertibles and were fitted with a range of V8 engines. Production of the fourth-generation Continental lasted until 1969 when it was replaced by the Fifth Generation Lincoln Continental.

The name was used for the top models in Ford's full-size range from 1958 until 1961, in a marketing attempt to appeal to the excitement surrounding the Space Race. In 1958, a concept car was introduced called \"la Galaxie\" which incorporated the headlights into pods in line with the grille and a reduced front profile. The 1963 model was essentially unchanged save for some freshening and added trim; windshields were reshaped, and a four-door hardtop 500/XL was added. A lower, fastback roofline was added mid-year to improve looks and make the big cars more competitive on the NASCAR tracks with less drag and reduced aerodynamic lift at high speed. Very few of these automobile icons are still on the road. Fewer still are the number of road-worthy units in such fantastic condition as this one!

As far as I know this 1961 Cadillac has 20.000 original miles, but after over 40 years of storage it still needs restoration. It was bought new by the owner of Swift trucking co, one of the biggest in the US and they used it mostly or only to drive to their vacation property in Mexico, 4 hours south ofPhoenix. They stopped using it in 70's and even though it has had several owners since then nobody has used or driven the Limo since. The original engine and trans were removed by a previous owner and used for a 1959 Cadillac Ambulance project due to the low mileage. The Bad: no engine or transmission, no front bumper, no title, most side glass broken (I have some good side glass but probably not all), dry interior. I have taken the Cadillac to DMV for a Level 1 inspection and it came up clean. I have the paperwork to go and get a bond and it will go with the car.

It was considered one of the first purpose-built city vehicles and provided an unbeatable economical package for those living in bustling metropolises. At 9'9\" long, there were few places one could not drive, or park, a Fiat 500. The diminutive sedan weighed just 1,100 lbs and was powered by a 479cc, 2-cylinder, air-cooled engine producing 13 horsepower (with later models increasing output to 17 horsepower). The 500 was an instant success and would see few updates throughout its nearly 20-year production run, over which time almost 4 million vehicles were sold. Today, the Fiat 500 is an instantly recognizable and well-loved piece of automotive history with cultural significance that cannot be overstated. This 1968 Fiat 500F is finished in a stylish blue over a black vinyl interior that perfectly suits the car's classic, fashion-forward shape. It is equipped with a factory fabric sunroof and an original-style black Italian license plate. The 2-cylinder engine performs well and scoots the 500 through traffic with ease. The 5-digit odometer reads 13,812 miles, which is believed to be accurate. This Fiat 500 is a joy to drive and turns heads everywhere it goes. It is a fantastic weekend runabout and is ready to be enjoyed by its next owner.  $17,500"

Previously from the Ray Evernham Collection Ray Evernham purchased this car for its quintessential representation of the Sprint Car design ethos of the 1970s, with the era later introducing wings with side boards attached to the top of the roll cage. Believed to be the chassis creation of Charlie Altfater, little of this cars early history is known. What can be ascertained is that this car was campaigned in period by driver Glenn D. Feuerstein of Seven Hills, Ohio. The official records show that it raced only twice with a finishing place of 18th at the 1978 30th annual Payless Super Markets Little 500 and a 23rd place finish at the 1980 32nd annual Payless Super Markets Little 500. What drew Ray Evernham to this car was its iconic in-period shape and setup that included a Stu Hillborn fuel-injected V-8 engine with magneto ignition and Brodix free-flow racing cylinder heads. The stance is typical dirt track with its staggered and offset wheel and tire combination featuring large M&H tires in the rear and grooved Goodyear front tires mounted on Halibrand magnesium wheels with tri-prong knock-offs. During this era of racing, the short, oval, dirt tracks were the stepping stone for a professional ride at the large, oval, speedway tracks like the prestigious Indianapolis Raceway. All of the greatest drivers of the Indianapolis Brickyardincluding A.J. Foyt, Al Unser, Bobby Unser, Wally Dallenbach, Mario Andretti, Lloyd Rudy, Pancho Carter, Johnny Rutherford and morecut their teeth and made their bones driving sprint cars in the short bullrings of Eldora, El Centro, Redding and Indianapolis Park. What made these sprint cars such lethal weapons was their immense horsepower relative to their light weight, all of which was contained within in a very short wheelbase. Driving an open-wheeled Sprint car sideways in close contact with one another separated the men from the boys in this form of racing. Engine last ran on Dyno in 2012 and was put in proper storage. Engine is fresh/ 0 hours ready to run. Worldwide shipping available, please email me for a Quote.  $9,500"

Presenting a nicely crafted 1967 Chevrolet Corvette 427/435 tribute car that captures the essence of its legendary predecessor. This Goodwood green coupe boasts an older restoration build, faithfully recreating the iconic 427/435HP configuration (tribute) with a Tri-Power setup and a 4-speed transmission. From its nicely cared for factory interior to its captivating exterior, this Corvette exudes timeless beauty and offers an exhilarating driving experience. This documented 1967 Corvette comes in its original Goodwood green shade, accentuated by striking white stinger stripes - a combination that epitomizes the allure of mid-year Corvettes. During a previous restoration, the car was partially disassembled and rebuilt, transforming it into a remarkable 427/435 tribute. Notably, it features a date code correct 427/435 HP engine, ensuring authenticity and performance. Step inside, and you'll be greeted by a beautifully restored green interior. The upholstery exudes luxury and comfort, complemented by brand new carpets and restored gauges, which appear crisp and vibrant behind crystal-clear lenses. Impressively, even the clock is in perfect working order. The monochromatic ambiance is enhanced by a real wood-rimmed steering wheel, while the chrome 4-speed shifter adds a touch of coolness. And yes, the AM/FM radio effortlessly tunes in to your favorite stations. Remarkably, the odometer shows only 69,586 believed-to-be original miles. Powering this remarkable Corvette is a freshly rebuilt 427/435 engine, featuring the signature Tri-Power setup concealed under the distinctive triangular air cleaner. With a robust cam inside, the engine emits an authoritative rumble and delivers exhilarating performance. The engine bay showcases proper detailing, though the paint exhibits signs of aging, giving the car a character that encourages occasional drives to let its 435 horses stretch their legs. Recent servicing of the 4-speed transmission and rear end, along with power brakes, ensures an effortless and enjoyable driving experience. Completing the package are the factory-style wheels, adding an extra touch of authenticity. To underscore the car's pedigree and condition, it was personally inspected by renowned Corvette expert Roy Sinor in January of this year (report available upon request). With every aspect nicely sorted and attended to, this Corvette is ready to hit the road and be enjoyed to the fullest. Its mere presence commands respect, and its performance never fails to impress. While a factory-original, matching-numbers 427/435 Corvette commands a substantial premium in today's market, this custom crafted tribute car presents a unique opportunity. Priced at a fraction of its counterpart, it offers the chance to own a remarkable piece of automotive history without compromising on performance or driving pleasure. Don't miss your chance to own this exceptional 1967 Chevrolet Corvette 427/435 tribute car. Embrace the joy of driving and make a statement wherever you go.  $124,000"

They have owned the car for about 30 years and were the ones that restored it way back then. They are hoping someone will give her a good home. The 1964 Starfire was a big car. It was however powered by a pretty stout engine. The 6.5L V8 was more than enough to get this car down the road. Features Include: The Starfire is in need of cosmetic work, but the owners have maintained the car mechanically very well. They have a friend with a local shop who takes care of any issues that may pop up. The car does need paint work, but the body still looks solid with very little sign of rust. The engine seems to run very well. It starts right up and doesn't smoke and I didn't notice any leaks. If you are a first time classic car buyer, this would make a good starter. It's drivable and looks good and any upgrades could be done gradually while you are still able to drive the car and enjoy it. Please feel free to call me with any questions.

Restored under the stewardship of the current owner, it has been treated to regular maintenance and been garage-kept since its restoration. This is a car that currently would be equally at home on the national show fields, a race track or on a trip across town for ice cream. The 1959 Bugeye was the initial U.S. model in the Sprite series, introduced in this market after winning its class in the 1959 12-hour race at Sebring, Florida. A Beautiful Restoration As noted, this Austin-Healey was the subject of a professional frame-off restoration in 1997/8 and garage-kept ever since. The car looks and runs much like it did when it left the showroom back in 1959 and has the British Motor Heritage Certificate confirming its originality. The car is refinished in its original Old English White, complimented by a matching black convertible top, and the quality of the paint attains show car standards. An excellent paint job tends to show a cars every flaw, but there are few flaws to see on this Healey. The underside of this Healey reflects the quality of the restoration and is, of course, free of rust and corrosion. The Red interior was replaced as part of the restoration and is in like-new condition from the dash to the back windowand everything in between. The Black convertible top is in excellent condition and the rear window is clear and free of any discoloration, as are the side curtains. The car is powered by its original (rebuilt) Healey inline 4 cylinder OHV engine with a displacement of 948 cc with an output just shy of 45hp. The engine is fed through its twin SU  It also has its original (rebuilt) smooth case 4-speed transmission that operates correctly. All of the safety equipment works properly (lights, signals, horn, wipers), as do the rebuilt gauges, warning lights and speedometer although the tachometer sometimes choses to stick. NOS Healey seat belts are installed for additional safety. The car has, in keeping with its Heritage Certificate: The Bugeye defines British Sports Cars While the Aston Martins, Jaguars and even the big (3000) Healeys may have set the bar for luxury in British sports cars, the Sprite was an affordable car that the average person could drive or race. And the Bugeye (Frogeye in Britain) was very poplar because it had unique styling, exciting performance, and reliability (first three places in its class in the 1959 12-hour race at Sebring). It is, in short, a true British sports car restored to an as new level. For more information call us at 540-370-4474  $29,900"

        "text": "Sunbeam Tiger 1965 $139,000  The key words to describe this Tiger are UNIQUE and ACCURATE.  Why UNIQUE:  Why ACCURATE:  History of the Tiger: The ownership and location history of #375 has been derived from conversation with the son of the second owner, and the third owner. Both provided oral information and documentation. I was also able to contact Tony Borroz, the son of owner number two, who provided additional insight into his fathers period of ownership. The ownership time period of owner one and two may not be split exactly correctly, but is believed to be pretty close.  The Anecdotal Story goes like this:    car or modify it in any way. I was unable to document his name.  The second owner Joe Borroz, moved to Vancouver, Washington in 1950 where he worked 30 years for Alcoa Aluminum as a tool and die maker. Joe was in his late 40s when he bought the car from owner number one. According to Joes son Tony, Joe did not believe the car should be modified, but rather maintained as stock. Joe regarded himself as the Caretaker of the Tiger, rather than the Owner. In 1995 Joe moved to Sierra Vista, Arizona, taking the car with him. Again, a very mature second owner that also was not a hot rodder or auto-crosser.  The car was always a Sunday car, never a daily driver, which kept the mileage down. To this day the car only has 95,000 miles, which is very low for a 60 year old car. It rains a lot in Oregon and Washington, which also probably helped keep the mileage low.  Fourteen years later in August 2009 Jeff Kane bought the car and relocated it to the Bay Area. The car was very complete and unmolested, retaining all the normal Tiger pieces that typically have been lost and replaced. Thats why Jeff bought the car, as you rarely see unmolested Tigers. Because of its age and unusually low mileage, Jeff commissioned Rootes Group Depot to totally restore and freshen the car. The suspension, brakes, interior and under carriage were redone. The engine was not rebuilt but carb, generator, distributor and radiator were redone. It is very likely that a valve job was performed.  Jeff had another Personalized Tiger that he drove primarily, leaving #375 to sit more than is good for them. When Jeff passed away, I bought the car from Emily Vassos, his wife.  The Freshen Up:  Since the car was in the Bay Area, as is Rootes Group, I asked Bill Martin what it would take to make the car exceptionally concours correct. At the time, Bill and other STOA members were using this car to write the concours correct judging manual. Bill and I spent an entire afternoon going over the car with a microscope. We filled 5 pages of a spiral bound notebook with small and not so small corrections to freshen and make corrections. Bill spent 6 months blowing thru the list. The totality of the result was stunning. It was as if the car was completely re-restored. After taking possession of the car, I did another 2 pages of fixes.  The First Showings:  The car was not finished when we took it to Tigers United 40 in 2019 held in Sacramento. CA. Unbelievably, the car took first place in Stock Concour, and also won the Howie Award for Best Stock Tiger, and then won the Peoples Choice Award.  Due to Covid, the next possible outing was Suni VII, held in Indepence, MO in September 2021. The Tiger easily placed First in the Stock Tiger class in the Concour Judging. Recently, the Tiger was shown at Tigers United 41 in Santa Maria, CA in June 2022. The Tiger won Stock Concour and for the second time won the prestigious Howie Award for best stock Tiger.  Why LUCKY:  So, to Unique and Accurate we have to add LUCKY. LUCKY, that the first two long term owners were very mature. LUCKY they were not hot rodders or auto-crossers. Lucky that they lived and cared for the car far away from the California scene, that destroyed so many cars. LUCKY, the car spent its whole life in favorable climates. LUCKY, that in the cars 60 year life, it has covered only 95,000 original miles.  The car runs and drives like a new Tiger with very tight suspension and steering. This Tiger runs exceptionally cool at both high and low speeds, and even stop and go. There are no oil leaks of any kind. Absolutely everything works properly, as noted in the Functions test at the two events attended.  REFERENCES:  Anyone interested in purchasing this car should very definitely discuss it with Bill Martin, who built the car, and more importantly was and is, the Chief Arbiter of Correctness. The following Tiger Notables Tom Hall and Patrick King are completely familiar and knowledgeable about this car and could be used as references. Of course, the car has been TACd and authenticated.  Potential Spares:  Potentially available spares not included in the purchase price are the following:  $139,000"

        "text": "Porsche 911T 1971 $155,000 (OBO)  - Chassis # 9111110750  The 911 was the model that officially put the Porsche name in front of the world. Both on the street and on the track, it was and continues to be one of the most popular luxury sports cars on the market. The air-cooled 911, produced from 1964 to 1998, went through a number of engines and styles before a full redesign came with the 996 series.  The 1970 and 1971 Porsche 911s were fitted with a larger, 2.2 L engine rather than the previous generations 2.0 L engine that could be mated to either a four-speed 911/00 manual transmission or a five-speed 911/01 manual transmission. The displacement increase brought horsepower figures to 123 hp in the 911T, 153 hp in the 911E, and 180 hp in the top-of-the-line 911S. The T joined its brethren in receiving ventilated disc brakes, making all 911s so equipped. This generation of 911 saw safer external door handles, rubber-mounted dashboard gauges, a steering lock, as well as a US-only warning buzzer to let the driver know the keys were left in the ignition.  For the 1971 model year, only the 911E & S had fuel injection, while the entry-level 911T came standard with Zenith carburetors. This changed in 1972 when fuel injection became standard across all models due to US emissions regulations. All 1971 models did, however, come equipped with three-speed intermittent windshield wipers and crankcase oil squirters for improved piston cooling.  This generation continued offering the Targa version, which gave the car a safer open-air experience to appease the U.S. NHTSA regulations. Rather than a fully open-top convertible, the Targa was equipped with a stainless steel-clad roll bar, a removable roof panel, and a removable plastic rear window.  The collectability and value of Porsche 911s, in general, has been steadily increasing over the past decade or so. Even though the T was the starter 911 for this generation, the US-market cars can be more desirable than their international counterparts due to the slight increase in horsepower. The Targa versions are also the best of both worlds between a coupe and a convertible, offering both experiences without much compromise.  This particular example, Chassis # 9111110750, is a 1971 model fitted with the five-speed 911/01 manual transmission. According to the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, it was ordered with optional front and rear stabilizers, comfort equipment, tinted glass, Targa top, and light metal wheels. It was finished in a fairly unique warm shade of yellow that not many cars at the time wore called Gold Metallic. The interior was finished in contrasting Black Leatherette, a color scheme it wears to this day. Not much is known about this 911Ts history other than the fact that it is a numbers-matching example with a good, driver-quality restoration. The stock Zenith carburetors were also upgraded to Webers, giving the car an upgraded and more reliable driving experience.  When we received it on consignment in June of 2022, we had some servicing performed to get the car in proper running order. Autocar Bespoke, LLC in Philadelphia, PA, started things off with an exterior and brightwork detail before we entrusted Performance Automotive Inc. in Malvern, PA, in September of 2022 with a clutch service that included a clutch cable, clevis pin, and pivot pin. It returned to Performance Automotive Inc. in August of 2023 for a full transmission rebuild that included a clutch pedal shaft, synchro sleeve, synchro rings and teeth, gear teeth, differential bearings, and fresh fluids. They also addressed some fuel system issues that were rectified with a new fuel pressure regulator and a carburetor rebuild.  As it sits, this 1971 Porsche 911T is a numbers-matching, driver-level restored example that is ready for a new adventure. The optional Targa top makes this a perfect choice for any weather while adding a style choice that revolutionized the industry when it was released. Those looking for a classic, entry-level 911 to add to their collection or to kickstart their Porsche lineup would be pleased with what this one has to offer. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the service records on file, the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, and the original spare wheel.

This beautiful -64 Riviera was restored and has been driven around 500 miles since completion. I sold it around 35 years ago to a friend and it was a 100% rust free car even before being restored. The then owner wanted a clean look up front so the headlights were mounted behind the corner chrome louvers and a 1965 Riviera grill installed. It looks like a 1965 Rivieraexcept the chrome louvers don't open. A new piston broke in the rebuilt 401 Nailheadafter 500 miles and the engine was damagedand the Buick went into long time storage. I recently bought a 425 Nailhead from a 1965 Riviera that has been totally, completely rebuilt. Bored with new pistons and rings, crank turned, new cam, lifters, timing gears and chain, oil pump, redone heads with hardened valve seats etc. It was a $5000 plus rebuild. The body of the Riviera is fantastic, never any rust. Mechanically it has been redone and rebuilt, the chrome is a mixture of rechrome and excellent original chrome. The interior was totally redone and it is fantastic also. New tires, in my pictures the car has incorrect wide white wall tires, they have since been replaced with skinnier white wall tires. New exhaust, new alternator, new master cylinder and the complete brake systemhas been rebuilt, rebuilt carburetor, new water pump, new fuel pump, recored original radiator and on and on. The restoration cost around $65.000 and that was around 15 years ago . I don't think there's another restored 1964 Riviera in this condition for sale at even close to my inexpensive price!

        "text": "Porsche 968 1993 $89,000 (OBO)  - Chassis # WPOZZZ962PS815259 When Porsche released the 968 in 1991, it was the last of a few things, including the last new front-engined Porsche until the Cayenne arrived in 2003 and the last of a series of water-cooled front-engine rear-wheel drive models that began in 1976 with the 924 and later the 944. While the 968 was supposed to be yet another revised model of the 944, dubbed the S3, Porsche decided it would be best to make it its own model thanks to the significant changes the engineers had made to the chassis. To appease those with a love for speed, Porsche released a lightweight version of the 968 dubbed the Clubsport from October 1992 to 1995. Many of the luxury features of the 968 were removed or made an option in pursuit of sheer performance. The car had less sound deadening, manual windows, manually adjustable lightweight Recaro racing seats a revised and lowered suspension system, wider 17-inch wheels, a thicker, three-spoke sports steering wheel with no airbag, non-heated washer jets, no engine bay vanity covers, no rear wiper, no rear seats, and a smaller battery. 1993 Clubsport models were only available in Grand Prix White, Black, Speed Yellow, Guards Red, or Maritime Blue with matching seat backs. Clubsport decals were standard in either black, red, or white, but they could also be deleted if wanted. The 968 CS used the same 3.0 L M44 I4 engine from the regular 968 backed by either a 6-speed manual, which this one is equipped with, or 4-speed Tiptronic automatic. The Clubsport weighed 2,910 lb (1,320 kg), or around 220 lb (~100 kg) lighter than the regular 968, which gave it a 5.6 second 0-60 mph time and a top speed of 162 mph (260 km/h). Clubsport models were only available in the UK, Europe, Japan, and Australia, and a total of 1232 were produced over three years. This particular example, Chassis # WPOZZZ962PS815259, was first registered in August 1993 in the Netherlands. It was painted in Speed Yellow over a Black/Speed Yellow Leatherette & Cloth interior, the same color scheme it wears today. Options included Equipment for France, a higher amperage battery, the rare limited-slip differential, air conditioning, and the anti-theft package, according to the Porsche Production Specifications document. It was very well maintained throughout the years, with a plethora of service records attesting to this. Some significant service records to note are new adjustable Koni shocks from V.D. Gugten in Bodegraven, Netherlands, in March of 2013 and new timing belts from RS Motors Porsche Centre West-Vlaanderen in Ingelmunster, Belgium, on July 5th of 2018. Around 2018, the car was imported into New Hampshire, where it was enjoyed until we acquired it sometime in June of 2023. We entrusted Mark Cavanaugh in Beverly, NJ, with performing the few services this 968 CS needed to be as perfect as it could be. Items included new door handle gaskets, windshield wipers, lower plastics, thermostat & seals, wheelhouse liners, power steering reservoir & hose, along with a few hose clamps, minor touchups, and repairs. If a track car is what youre after, you cannot go wrong with a Porsche 968 CS, especially one with the LSD option like this one. The difference in handling will absolutely be clear over one without the LSD, and the impact of the 220 lb loss over the regular 968 is hard to overstate. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the original owners manual, tool kit, factory brochures, German paperwork, the service records on file, and an extra set of keys.

        "text": "Lotus Elise 2005 $59,000 (OBO)  - Chassis # SCCPC11195HL31931  When Lotus debuted the Elise in 1996, the revolutionary fiberglass body shell and extruded aluminum chassis made it an ideal British sports car with rigid suspension, low cost, and weight. The Series 1 Elise was produced from 1996 to 2001, with the Series 2 coming along later that year to meet new European crash regulations. The Series 2 was produced until 2011 and featured a new Lotus-developed ECU and was the first car produced by the British marque to be designed on a computer. The Elise delivered stateside was powered by a Toyota 2ZZ-GE 1.8 L I4 tuned by Lotus to 190 hp and backed by a Toyota C64 6-speed manual transmission. Figures from the test showed a 060 mph time of approximately 4.9 seconds. The small size, great handling, and relatively budget-friendly price of the Elise made it a popular choice for drivers who wanted both a track-friendly car that was equally as usable in the city. Despite its price, all three generations had exotic car-like looks that set it apart from other sports cars on the market at the time. According to apost on the Lotus Talk forums, certificates provided by Lotus historian Andy Graham point to 3,323 examples of the Lotus Elise being produced in 2005, 202 of those being in Racing Green Metallic. This particular example, Chassis # SCCPC11195HL31931, was brought into the port of Charleston, SC from the UK in February of 2005 in Racing Green Metallic over a *** interior. It was delivered to Manhattan Motor Cars in New York, NY in May of that year and was used as one of two demonstrator cars at the dealership. The manual windows point to this Elise being a very early car as subsequent cars had electric windows. The first owner purchased the car in November 2006 with 900 miles on the odometer. The car was upgraded to 2006-spec through dealer-fitted, factory-supplied parts, including the rear wing, the rear Lotus badge, LED tail lamps with European amber turn lenses, and the supercharger. In August of 2007, the selling dealer performed the first service record on file, a 7,500-mile service despite the odometer reading less than 2,000 miles, and serviced the blower motor as well. In 2012, the owner had a number of factory upgrades installed in recognition of the newly announced Jim Clark Type 25 Elise. They had a Type 25 interior fitted by the Lotus dealer on Long Island, which included the Type 25 wooden gear knob, rear window cap, hard top, and yellow highlights on the rear wing painted by Chuck Reiser in 2005 Lotus yellow. The owner also had the correct black Type 25 wheels fitted that currently wear brand-new Yokohama Advan tires. The original Blaupunkt radio was also changed for a similar Blaupunkt model with Bluetooth capability. Any and all of the parts that were swapped out during this transformation were kept and are included in the sale of the car. The Elise continued to be serviced at Manhattan Motor Cars and the Lotus dealer on Long Island until 2015, when it began being kept in highly professional storage in upstate New York. As it sits, this is a well-maintained, one-owner Lotus Elise with less than 5,000 miles on the odometer and unique Type 25 factory upgrades to help it stand out from the rest at your local British-only car show. Those looking to partake in the car that gave Lotus its modern reputation for lightweight, driver-focused cars would fall in love with what this Elise offers, especially with the Type 25 supercharger under the hood. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the original owners literature, purchase documents, window sticker, and service records on file. The car also comes with its original rims bearing an unused set of correct Bridgestone tires, the original Blaupunkt radio, the original unpainted engine covers, soft-top, hard-top, original seats, all the original pieces that were replaced for the 2006 spec update, door cards, lotus branded car cover, original steering wheel, and more.  $59,000 (OBO)"

The Avanti was ahead of its time in design and the Studebaker 289 V8 was a great engine. They offered a variety of models and configurations, but the best and rarest was the addition of the R2 package in any of the models offered by Studebaker; Lark, Hawk and Avanti. The R2 package boosted horsepower with the addition of a huge Mcculloch belt driven supercharger placed on top of the Studebaker 289. The R2s are awesome and could also be had with the optional Hallibrand wheels. The R2 cars were competitive race cars in stock form right from the factory and are an extremely rare sighting today especially a very lateSuper Hawk which was the most refined and most powerful R2 Hawk produced. Only a handful of original Super Hawks exist today. Offered here is an incredibly well preserved 1964 Studebaker Gran Tourismo Hawk with the rare R2 package and just 44,000 original miles from new.

        "text": "BMW Z3 1978 $38,000 (OBO)  - VIN # WBSCK9333XLC89705  The reintroduced popularity of the roadster body style brought about by the Mazda Miata in North America necessitated a reaction from the European Makes to offer their own interpretation on the genre after helping establish a market in the mid-century.  BMW entered into the fray in 1995 with the Z3. In classic roadster fashion, a long hood and short rear deck composed the overall shape. However, the lines were far from the typical teutonic straightedges commonly seen in the period, and instead, designer Joji Nagashima employed the softer, rounder shapes from the roadsters of the past. Every single body panel possesses some form of curvature, an element that surely gave the manufacturing side of the business a bit of a headache. Fortunately, it all works quite well, and today, the Z3 looks like nothing BMW has put out before or since, and the boldness of the design has aged remarkably well.  Enthusiasts of the brand might have been saddened to see an inline-6 unavailable at launch under that long hood, but all could rest assured that BMW would deliver soon enough. Many could be satisfied with the lightness and responsiveness of the 4-cylinder models, but more power always tends to make things better. Just a year after the cars introduction, the traditional Inline-6 arrived along with deliciously punched out fenders allowing for a 2.5inch wider rear track. It was only a matter of time now before the M-division got its hands on the little roadster.  Falling in line with E36 M3, North American examples of the new Z3 M Roadster were fitted with the S52 engine upon release. While down on power from its more exotic, individual throttle-bodied cousin, this bored and stroked M52 motor is not without its merits in the context of the contemporary automotive scene. At the end of the day, a naturally aspirated inline-6 with a 7,000rpm redline makes for an enticing proposition to any gearhead.  The Z3 M Roadster on offer here, chassis # WBSCK9333XLC89705, is a 1-owner example finished in Estoril Blue over a full black interior. Showing just 24,266 miles this is one of the most well cared for examples we have handled. Delivered new to Roadshow BMW in Tennessee, the car was immediately sent to its one and only owner in Decatur, Illinois. From here the owner began thoroughly enjoying the Z3 as he put roughly 6,000 miles on the car in its first two summers. Over the next 6 years usage became less frequent but still regular with proper maintenance carried out along the way. As it sits today this Z3 is entirely unmodified and ready for continued use after a baseline fluids swap as the last service was done in late 2020, or roughly 1,000 miles ago. This Z3 M Roadster presents a great opportunity to acquire a collector grade example of the platform. With a handwritten log documenting every service and the miles corresponding to them you know exactly how meticulously maintained the car really is.  Included in the sale are the tools, first aid kit, black leather tonneau cover, the Z3 Roadster branded tonneau carrier case, and available service records and logs.

This car can be driven as is orbecome an excellentcandidate for full restoration to a show standard. It currently runs but is in need of tuning. The paint is an older inexpensive re-spray in what appears to be the original color. As shown in the photos, there isa solid foundation to work with. The undercarriage is very clean for a 50-year-old car. There are signs of previous rust repair on certain body panels, which is to be expected. Frankly, if addressed by Roadster Salon, we would recommend stripping the entire car to bare metal and addressing any prior body work before moving forward. An enthusiast might notice the hood has louvers from a later model Z, and period correct alloy wheels. The interior condition is very encouraging and original. While never a certainty, it generally portends of a well-cared for example when a car's interior is clean with minimal wear and tear. This lovely car can be purchased one of two ways. Either as is without further mechanical or cosmetic enhancements, or with a detailed restoration contract.

        "text": "Land Rover Series I 1967 $39,999  Up for sale is a Super Rare 1967 Land Rover 109 Forward Control. This Truck came from South Africa and was one of the rare ones that was well preserved. It was used has a extreme safari vehicle, and was retired and later restored. Comes with Clean Florida Title. They were made until the early 70's and later on ceased production. Very few were actually manufactured, and most of them that did were never sold to the civilian market. Most of the Forward Control were sold as work trucks, and were generally worked hard. This hard work combined with relatively low production numbers, means that few Forward Controls survive. Many of the survivors are conversions (e.g.. camper vans and fire engines) that led a less strenuous life. This distinctive vehicle was based on the Series II 109\" chassis but had the cab positioned over the engine, resulting in a greatly increased load space. A new rear sub-frame was attached to the 109\" chassis to produce a flat load space. The result was a vehicle rated at carrying 30 cwt on the road, and 25 cwt cross-country. The original engine was a 4-cylinder 2.25-litre diesel engine and now has a more reliable Chevrolet 250cid Straight-six engine. You can find parts easily for this engine and order them online as well. Has 4-speed transmission. Check out my video of the 109 FC driving. It sits really high and is just cool to drive! It has 2 radiators, one with one big fan and the other radiator with 2 fans. Car runs cool! It has really nice brown upholstery that was redone. Has a roof latch that lets you access the roof area. Also has a full storage area in the back. Has the rear guard bar with full spare. You can also but your bicycle in the back. It also has a water tank. Lots of really cool features. Apparently less then 2,500 were made! I'm located in Miami about 30 minutes away from the airport. Feel free to come see the Truck in person. Any inquires email me. Sold As-is where is. $500 non-refundable deposit. For those interested you can call me at 305 five four two 5662. If I don't answer just leave me a voicemail. Like any cars there's always your normal regular wear and tear items. Buyer responsible for pick up or shipping car. Thanks for looking. Really rare opportunity.  If you're looking to finance I would recommend JJ Best. They can finance your classic car or hot rod and are very pleasant to work with.  $39,999"

In 1965 the Electra-Glide was upgraded with an electric start but the big change was in 1966 when the Panhead gave way to the new Shovelhead. It had an aluminum head with a different-shaped combustion chamber and rocker arms attached to the rocker cover instead of to the head itself. By 1969 the factory King of the Highway package included a removable batwing fairing on the handlebars, hard saddlebags and a top case at the rear. 1970 was the year that AMF took control of Harley-Davidson and significant changes were made to the FLH which included relocating the ignition inside the gear case cover and the generator was replaced with an alternator inside the primary case. In 1972 a front disc brake was added. When it was brand new this particular example was optioned with the King of the Highway package in addition to a Harley stereo pod with stereo and speakers. Other than the wear items this bike is all original. Not only that but it is a 2 owner bike that the current owner purchased in 1985 and has an incredibly low 20,404 miles. The second owner purchased it with just over 19,000 original miles and has barely ridden it since. It was recently serviced and runs incredibly well. Everything is working as it should and it is need of nothing but a new home. If youd like that to be your home we suggest reaching out right away!  $9,900"

He had it consigned at a local dealer who I purchased the car from. One of only 792 produced in \"Calypso Coral\" paint code. The paint is all original with the exception of the passenger front fender that had a repaint back in the 70's. Still shines beautifully but does have nicks, dents, chips, and scratches from its 60 years of existence. 41,000 miles believed to be original but not noted on title. All original Drivetrain that has only been serviced and resealed as needed. Recently I upgraded the front drum brakes to a Wilwood 6 piston Disc brake with power assist. I was able to utilize the original hubs. I upgraded the suspension with a \"wild Horses\" 2-1/2\" lift kit. Very nice progressive springs that ride ultra smooth. I installed Bilstein Shocks on all 4 corners and added US Mag 5 slots with 30x 9.5 15 BFG All Terrains. Great stance. Transmission is the original 3 on the tree manual. Differentials are factory 4.11 gear. The interior was originally white but needed replacement. Seats were redone in Black with houndstooth inserts. The floors were fully insulated and covered in custom fitted German Square weave carpet. I added a Retrosound stereo that has bluetooth with Mic for phone calls with Infiniti speakers. there are also two USB plug ins. An all new Vintage air AC and heat unit was installed that makes driving in the summer much nicer. Its nearly impossible to find a Bronco in such original unmolested condition. Ive kept the original Brakes, springs, heater box etc just in case anyone wanted to bring her back to stock.

Car crafting had gone toward a more radical approach as the 1960s era began, and this creation ---- aptly named Legacy ----- captures that theme from every angle. Of course, programs of this nature began with a 'hot mill,\" as the writers would say, in the case a crrca-1962 327 CI Corvette V-8 engine with extensive detailing and equipped with a front-mounted 6-71 crankshaft-driven blower kit. Using period - appearing side-draft carburetors, gold and chrome plating with custom handengraving abound on this powerplant, while a Hurst shift arm directs the transmission behind it. From the exterior, one notes the roofline ---- which came from a 1957 Buick ----- is chopped 3 inched and then channeled 5 inches at the front, graduating to 2.5 inches at the rear. The rear fender wells are boxed and the fender ends themselves were extended 6 inches and raised 1.5 inches, with 1959 Cadillac tail lights installed. Even the trunk is shopped 8 inches. A 1961 Chrysler front fender assembly showcases extended angular headlamps, with the front fender wells flared with 3/4-inch chromoly tubing and boxed to conceal wiring. Metal fabrication was utilized throughout the build with no fiberglass. A 1962 Jaguar independent rear suspension (widened 8 inches), front suspension and Jaguar universal joints provide underpinnings and components are either gold or chrome plated. The engine rests in hand-built motor mounts, while brake and gas lines have been enclosed within the modified square-tube frame. The deep tones selected for the paint are dramatic, with a power blue custom interior inside. The most modern upgrade beyond that is a set of Colorado Custom wheels that put it to the pavement through BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires. Through a car club jacket is not part of the sale, you'll feel like you are part of a select group of owners with Jim Cusumano's Legacy.  $70,000 (OBO)"

History: I bought this car back in 2009 as a project. It was headed for a turn into a convertible project. It had no engine or transmission in it. The body was all there and most of the trim was complete. The first thing I did was pull the body off the chassis. I had the chassis blasted and painted chassis black. Then the body went off to get body worked and painted. I went with the color it wasHarbor blue and India Ivory. The paint was a modern color Harbor blue. I will describe the car as I remember. I have done the work and have owned this car since 2009. Lets talk about the drivetrain. It has a GM 350 Crate motor with an Edelbrock carb. The transmission is a Metric 200. It has new U-Joints, and the rear end is stock. Today, the 6 th of May 2023, I removed all 4 wheels, inspected the brakes and cylinders, the drums, and the hoses, and they are all good. Pictures attached. I then cleaned the wheels and white walls, re-installed them, and torqued all lug nuts to 95-foot pounds. Note here: The rear tires and rims come off the car without disconnecting the shocks like some of the resto-rods need. The steering is very nice and easy. I had installed the poor mans power steering bearing idler arm kit and it is nice. The original wheel makes the car steer very easily. The shocks were all new. The chassis was black and the under body of the car is blue. You can see that there is no rust on the floors.  The body has ZERO rust. It was solid to start with and has always been in heated storage when not driven. Over the years that I have owned this car, it has had less than 4,000 miles on it. The speedo gear is off quite a bit, so the odometer reading is over what is shows which is 4,300 and some miles. It runs down the road very nicely.  The stereo system in the car is nice and sounds great! I have a radio in the dash only for a filler. The under-dash unit works great and BOOMs as it should.  The interior is done like it should be back in 1956. New seat covers, new carpet, bladder type padded dash, new visors, new headliner (my favorite part of the car), new door panels and the door sills were the last set NEW in the country! They are beautiful.  It has a nice new firewall pad and the under dash is nice. It has new wiring.  It was Safety inspected back a few years ago and passed with flying colors.  You can drive and show this rare beauty to any car show with great results, and you will be the talk of the town!!! Fly in and drive it back to your homeenjoy the ride!!  $32,000"

This investment grade 930 Turbo is among one of the finest examples we have offered in years.

We are proud to offer this incredible 930 Turbo to the most demanding collector, investor, or enthusiast who desires to own one of the very best! Model History: As such, the Turbo name quickly became synonymous with high performance, albeit performance that demanded the talents of an experienced driver: This is a wickedly fast car that can easily punish those who do not approach it with skill and respect. Of course, this only added to its appeal and is still renowned for its driving dynamics today. Also, while the 930 served as the homologation basis for Porsches fearsome 934 racers, it was no stripped-down track weapon. Turbos were luxuriously equipped, with a long list of standard equipment including air-conditioning, full leather, a rear wiper, headlamp washers, and a stereo. Further options, including a power sunroof, were offered as well. In 1978, Porsche updated the model with a larger 3.3-liter engine with a stated US-market output of 253 horsepower, an air-to-air intercooler, revised suspension, and new brakes. With the US emissions restrictions tightening once again in 1980, 1979 became the last model year that the Porsche 930 was specified for the American market for some time to come.  $149,900"

It was designed in the United States by William J. Flajole for Nash-Kelvinator International. At first, the cars were to be sold as the NKI Custom. While the design was American, the cars were built in the United Kingdomthe bodywork was built by Fisher & Ludlow while the mechanicals and final assembly were by the Austin Motor Company. It was the first time an American-designed car had been entirely built in Europe. While most U.S. automobile makers were following a bigger-is-better philosophy, Nash Motor Company executives were scrutinizing the market to offer American buyers an economical transportation alternative. It was designed as a commuter/shopping car with resemblance to the big Nash, but on a significantly smaller scale. Owners reported that the Metropolitan is a good thing in a small package. It is powered by the Austin A50 1489-cc, 52-hp engine coupled with a three-speed manual transmission.

        "text": "Maserati Ghibli 1967 $350,000 (OBO)  Making its debut at the Turin (Italy) Motor Show in November 1966, the Maserati Ghibli coupe made waves within the automotive industry. When deliveries of production cars began in March 1967, the Ghibli had evolved from the two-seat prototype into a fastback 2+2 touring coupe that Sports Car International magazine would later rank in the Top 10 on its list of top sports cars from the 1960s. A total of 1,170 Ghibli coupes were manufactured from 1967 until production ended with the 1973 model year. Tastefully appointed in a medium blue livery with a tastefully contrasting tan leather bucket seat interior, the Ghibli is powered by a front-mounted 4.7L dual overhead cam V8 engine displacing 306 horsepower backed by a five-speed manual transmission. The dash holds full instrumentation, including a 180 MPH speedometer. The car also has air conditioning, something rare on 60s era sports cars. An under hood factory tag indicates this car to be the 74th Ghibli ever manufactured. This vehicle has been a part of the present owners automotive portfolio since May 2021 and has been driven occasionally during his ownership. The car has been housed in a humidity controlled environment since he became the custodian of this rare vehicle. The cars odometer reads 16,571 miles which we believe to be correct but in accordance with Missouri statutes concerning the sale of motor vehicles the Ghibli will be sold mileage exempt due to age. The owner has recently acquired the original prototype Maserati Ghibli Spyder and has decided to offer this vehicle for sale. Evergreen Digital Showroom offers this exceptional and rare Maserati for sale at a price of $350,000 USD. As with all of the vehicles we offer for sale, a pre-purchase inspection is welcomed and recommended. We will gladly arrange transportation of this vehicle at buyers expense or will work with the shipping company of buyers choice to facilitate delivery. For additional information or to make an offer on this car, call sales manager Steve Russell at 417-532-8000. NOTICE Because of the number of vehicles we represent we cannot drive every vehicle for long distances. These vehicles have been part of static displays for long periods of time, in some cases for decades, and are subject to the flaws and imperfections consistent with that. While we do our best to disclose all issues we known about a vehicle in our advertising, these are old cars and something that has always worked in the past might not function properly today. Please check the requirements of your state regarding the licensing and registration of classic vehicles and make sure the vehicle you are looking at meets those if applicable. Unless otherwise noted, all vehicles represented by Evergreen Digital Showroom possess a clean (non-branded) title which will be provided the new buyer when purchase funds clear our financial institution. Virtually all our vehicles are sold as mileage exempt due to their age. We do not warranty any vehicle, nor any part of the vehicle including air conditioning systems, brake systems, electrical systems and gauges, fuel systems, accessories or powertrain components. These are old vehicles and it is very common for them to require certain maintenance and upkeep for them to be operational. In many cases issues with leaks may develop when being driven after a long period of not being used. This is common, as classic cars at some point will leak fluids. For this reason, we do not encourage buyers to attempt driving their purchase home as we cannot guarantee functional reliability of these vehicles. We strongly encourage prospective buyers to be sure they are comfortable with these issues before purchasing a classic car. Descriptions of vehicles represented by Evergreen Digital Showroom are intended to be informational in nature and do not in any way constitute any sort of warranty, expressed or implied. Again, these vehicles are presented as-is, where-is without guarantee or warranty. Vehicles manufactured prior to 1981 will likely not be included in the databases of companies such as CarFax and AutoCheck that provide vehicle history information to consumers.

        "text": "Oldsmobile 442 1969 $39,900  The 4-4-2 (also known as the 442) is a muscle car produced by Oldsmobile from 1964  1987. Originally it was introduced as an optional package for the F-85 and Cutlass models. The 2nd generation was introduced in 1968 which is when the 442 became its own model. In 1969 the changes were subtle and included a division tooth between the grilles, the wing windows were deleted, trunk lid inlets were added for the tail lights and headrests were added to the front seats. This particular example is believed to be a 4 owner car with 38,268 original miles. It retains its original 396026 400ci V8 engine that was professionally rebuilt by Jimmies Motor Rebuilding Co. out of Peru, IL in August of 2021. At the same time the original T400 transmission was also rebuilt and both now have less than 1,000 miles on them. It is fed via an Edelbrock 4 barrel carb and Performer intake. It is sparked by an electronic ignition and exhaust is handled by a set of performance headers and a new performance dual exhaust system which sounds just plain nasty when you get into it. At the same time the engine was rebuilt the suspension received new springs and pads and the brakes received a new master cylinder, wheel cylinders and lines. It also received new steel braided fuel lines, vacuum lines, transmission lines, coolant lines, a new water pump and a new radiator. It was repainted in its original color of Red about 20 years ago which has held up very well but is starting to show its age. All the weather stripping was replaced when the engine was done as well and everything lines up and closes as it should. The interior is all original with the exception of the B&M slap shifter and the aftermarket gauges. Everything works as it should except for the voltage meter and the gas gauge. When it was repainted it was also upgraded with the W-32 dual snorkel air intake which is 100% correct. Pictures of the engine casting and serial #s are posted below. The car is an absolute pleasure to drive and in need of nothing but having a couple of gauges repaired. Based on the current NADA values we would conservatively appraise this beauty at $49,600. We have priced it much lower than that to get her sold quick so if you like what you see dont wait until it is too late to contact us!  $39,900"

If you would like to place a deposit on this one, we will do our best to accommodate most or all of your needs once a deposit has been secured. There will be licensing and registration fees and sales taxes (if you are registering it in CA), licensing and registration costs should not exceed 2% of the overall vehicle cost, and will not be due until the delivery of the vehicle. * Some features of this build could still be modified or upgrades still could be added if someone likes the way this Bronco is being built but they want slightly different features, (not after parts have already been installed on the vehicle).  ** All information is subject to change until a deposit is secured. Scheduled completion date: 12-15-2023  $150,000"

        "text": "Studebaker Gran Turismo 1962 $24,900  The Gran Turismo (GT) Hawk is a grand touring coupe that was sold by Studebaker from 1962 -1964. It was Studebakers top of the line model that evolved from the 1956 Golden Hawk. The 1962 model was brilliantly redesigned by Brooks Stevens by putting on a new grille, shaving off the fins and adding a new squarer roofline. Despite the fact that the Studebaker engine was heavy for its size the GT Hawk boasted performance and handling not typically found in an American made car. This particular example is equipped with its original 289ci V8 rated at 225hp and is mated to a Flight-O-Matic automatic transmission. It was optioned with A/C, a clock, a tachometer, deluxe floor mats and a gorgeous two-tone interior. It was repainted in its original color of Studebaker Blaze Red about 10 years ago and it still shows like new. It is a rust free car that was relocated from Colorado to the Midwest just after being repainted and has not seen a winter since. Everything but the clock works as it should. The A/C was just serviced and blows ice cold. The car has 75,929 original miles and is need of nothing but a basic service and a new garage to park in.  $24,900"

A wonderfully spacious tourer packed with class, Jaguar's flagship where they loved to show off all their gadgets and new gizmos. The fastest four-seater in the world when the car first rolled off the assembly line. The car was rarely delivered as a coup anyway, which now makes this a real collector's item. Anyway, enough about investment and performance, let's talk about what lasting impression this car leaves behind. After all, a Jaguar driver also knows that you have to drive this car with respect. That means that the sports hangover of yesteryear should purr quietly, not roar. It is sometimes said in the car world, the car looks like its owner. However, this tomcat also knows how to take the owner with her grandeur. Indeed, when you get in, you immediately get the feeling that you know about opera, wine, politics and poetry. Ours? Dutch delivered! A 6-cylinder what feels slightly more favourable in terms of consumption and weight ratio than the 12-cylinder and can still slot in well. Fully taken care of on the operating table so you can enjoy this classic car carefree. To top it all off, fully documented too! That's a tasty start, right? - \"Money may not buy happiness, but i'd rather cry in my Jaguar than on a bus\"- Franoise Sagan  $52,500"

The first-generation Dodge Ram trucks were manufactured from 1981 to 1993 and are known for their boxy and utilitarian design. This 1985 Ram pickup truck is one of the cleanest examples you will find from this generation of Dodge trucks. This Ram is a hard-to-find and desirable vehicle for a couple reasons. Being that this vehicle is originally from Arizona, it is rust free. Secondly, it came from the factory equipped with a short bed and full 4WD functionality. This truck is also powered by its original powertrain as it sports its original 318 cubic inch V8 engine that is mated to an automatic transmission. The 4WD shifter sits in the middle of the floor in the cab making it easy to shift into the functional 4WD system. The vehicle shows about 82,000 miles, but total mileage is unknown. The exterior is in great shape and has a very dashing appearance as its bright red and white two-tone color scheme is separated by black and gray pinstripes that can be seen around the entirety of the vehicle. Moving to the suspension, this truck has been upgraded with a Rancho suspension and sits on 31 Dick Cepek all-terrain tires and 15 chrome Ram wheels. The truck features both power steering and power brakes with disc brakes up front. All these features result in a ride that is both comfortable and safe for a classic truck like this one. The interior of this single cab truck is in very good condition and features no rips or tears. You will be cooled down by the factory air conditioning system and will be switching through the different stations through its modern radio system. If you are in the market for a classic pickup truck that will make you feel like you are back in the 1980s then this is the truck for you. Its stock appearance, original powertrain, and super clean body and frame is what makes this vehicle look like it recently came off the showroom floor.

L-head V-8, three-speed manual transmission, solid front axle, semi-elliptic leaf spring suspension, and rear-wheel drum brakes. Wheelbase: 128 in. Vintage speedsters have been produced by enthusiasts on a variety of chassis, but this is one of very few built on the basis of a Peerless, the Cleveland-built car considered one of the Three Ps of great American motoring, alongside the famous Packard and Pierce-Arrow. Peerless was renowned in its time for its durable, conservative engineering, reflected in the long-term reliability of its product. Former owner Ivan Jones and his late wife, Audrey, of Littleton, Colorado, spent the late 1970s painstakingly gathering parts for the car from points East and West. Mr. Jones was a car aficionado and skilled craftsman. Inspired by the speedsters produced by Peerless in the teens, they then built this automobile, together, by hand, completing it in 1981. The car is well-finished, with fenders reminiscent of Brass Era performance cars such as Simplex and American Underslung, a 1922-23 Peerless radiator shell, Peerless Model 66 drum headlights, and cream wire wheels, shod in blackwall tires. The interior features two bucket seats, in the manner of the Mercer Raceabout, forward of a large original Peerless-badged oval gas tank with fillers on both ends, wooden storage box, and dual rear-mounted spares. All components except for the body panels are Peerless, with the seats and teak dashboard being Mr. Jones own creations. The windshield frame was cast from a wooden prototype made by Mr. Jones. He even went so far as to shoot the elk that donated its hide to the seats, lovingly upholstered by Mrs. Jones. Power is supplied by a 1923 332 cu. in. Peerless V-8 and three-speed transmission, on the original frame, all acquired after years spent powering a sawmill in the Midwest. Side exhaust emerges from the right side of the hood and disappears under the body, a touch reminiscent of period Grand Prix cars as well as supercharged Duesenbergs. Current owner added a gear-vender overdrive for comfortable cruising speeds. Ivan and Audrey Jones subsequently traveled the United States with the speedster that they dubbed The Fearless Peerless. Together the trio enjoyed several tours with the Veteran Motor Car Club of America. Among its duties was leading the parade lap for Indy drivers at the Denver Grand Prix in 2006, driven by longtime friend Jimmy Aretakis. It was also well-known in print, appearing on the cover of the May/June 2002 issue of the VMCCA magazine, There are few more distinctive, fun vintage speedsters than this car  a truly one-of-a-kind creation, with robust, well-proven performance and bodywork crafted with love and care. It is genuinely thrilling to drive and ready to add more adventures to its long history.  $59,500"

As the only American-designed, mass-produced passenger car with arear-mounted,air-cooled engine,the Corvair was manufactured and marketed in two-door coupe, convertible, four-door sedan, four-door station wagon, passenger van, commercial van, and pickup truck body styles in its first generation (19601964) as well as two-door coupe, convertible and four-door sedan in its second generation (19651969).In 1962, Chevrolet introduced the Corvairs with few changes at the beginning of the year. The bottom line 500 series station wagon was dropped and the 700 became the base station wagon. The \"Lakewood\" name was dropped. The ever-popular Monza line then took on a wagon model to round out the top of the line. In spring of 1962, Chevrolet committed itself to the sporty image they had created for the Corvair by introducing a convertible version. This first year convertible is really a great, low-mileage example. This is a high performance (102hp) Super Turbo-Air model with the corresponding \"YN\" engine code and crossed racing flags on the deck-lid. It spent most of its life in Georgia and most of its 57 year history is known. After being stored and never driven once between 1974-1989 it was purchased by the 2nd owner. He drove it periodically and decided to complete a restoration in 2004. Photo documentation of this first restoration accompany this sale. The seller also provided us with a large stack of documentation including GA registration history, period literature, original dealer badge, and several receipts. When we received the Corvair this year it had just enough wear that we decided to complete a second restoration. Our first step was to leave the Corvair with a local expert who did a complete rebuild of the drivetrain. We then did a complete repaint in the original Antique White. The battery is new and the Corvair just received a full tune-up. The final addition was a set of 185/80 R15 White Wall Tires! Needless to say, we think we have this 72k mile example standing tall and ready for the next owner to enjoy. Contact us today for further details or to start the ownership process.

You made it in life, if you had one of these. Unique lines combined with that front and back end that only a top of the line Lincoln would possess. Power & a Ride like no other but only room for a few good friends. Current owner is a true Ford & Lincoln fan, and has owned this Mark III for about 14 years now. He found it in North Jackson Ohio and it was originally delivered new by the Lincoln dealer in Ambridge Pa. New battery and tray, 4 new shocks, new calipers & pads, brake cylinders & shoes completed fall of 2021. Though driven little, you are seeing it in its natural condition without any professional detail. Oil and filter change every year or two. Owner is also a Torino fan and has one of those. Cant drive them all! 4 extra original hubcaps go with the car.  For more information and photos visit our site at www.autoconnectioncars.com or call Chad at 330-353-1750  DETAILS OF CAR:  460 V-8, Auto Temperature Control Air Conditioning & Heating, Unique Factory Vinyl Top, AM-FM Stereo, Power Steering, Power Brakes, 6 Way Power seats on driver & passenger side, Auto Transmission, P Antenna, White Wall Radials, Inside Trunk Release, Remote Drivers Mirror, Traction Lock with 2:80 highway Gearing. Tilt Steering Wheel, Sure Track Braking, Reclining Passenger Seat, Split Bench Seating. Also includes an owners manual (see pics)  Marti Report and Marti window sticker included / title Indicates actual Mileage  Paint  * Paint has a very nice reflective shine and a finish that looks much as when they were produced in that era. Slight orange peal as typical.  * Paint matches well all the way around the sides and upper surfaces  * Looks and seems to possibly be all or mostly all original paint that it was born with. Read comments in magnetic paint gauge section for explanation. We cant be 100% sure since owner hasnt had car since 1971 when new  * See pictures for details of small defects that exist in paint finish.  * There are a few nicks and worn spots (above left rear tire) in the paint. A couple or more nicks on fenders, doors, and quarters and a few scuffs not completely through the paint and might possibly be polished out. (see pics)  Body  * Body panels in general are very nice and straight.  * Exceptions being 3 very slight dimples you can see on the hood and 1 slight dimple in the pass side door, but only at just the right angle and under high intensity lighting. (see pics)  * Fits and gaps around hood, trunk, and doors are very consistent with what you would have expected to see when car was new. (See pics)  Magnetic Paint Gauge  *   * Hood and trunk readings were consistently in the 4 to 5 mils range. This in our opinion would more likely be consistent with an aged and polished original surface vs a repainted surface.  * Side panels (front to back), readings were typically in the 4 to 6 mils range with below the lower body line being more in the 2-4 mils range.  * Along bottom of all body panels showed no higher readings indicating repair of rust or paint.  * inspection of door jambs did not indicate any obvious signs of repaint or over spray and actually showed human & weatherstrip wear consistent with use and older paint.  Bright work  *   * Overall bright works has a nice highly reflective finish and shows well.  * Bright work surrounding windows is very reflective with some scratching below drivers door glass and typical pot metal pitting on molding immediately behind the LR window. (see pics)  * Moldings running along the top of fenders and doors are very shiny and mostly flawless. ( couple little scuffs)  * Door handles are very reflective with just a few typical scratches along the top.  * Drivers rear view mirror shell is very reflective with a small amount of pitting on top.  * Grill work, front and rear bumper all have good reflective qualities but show a little bit of light wear  * Rear bumper middle has light impact crease running top to bottom and has affected the molding directly above (see pics).  Glass  * Windshield, rear glass, and all 4 side glass all have the Car-Lite emblem  * Glass is all nice and clear. We do not see any discoloring, delamination, bulls eyes, cracks, or any wiper wear.  * Windshield may have a few pin head sized nicks from normal driving and drivers window does have a group of light vertical scratches at top from normal window movement (see pics).  Vinyl Top  *   * Seams running down both sides are in good condition without any signs of splitting apart.  * There are a couple little bumps by lower right rear window glass but top doesnt show signs of significant rust issues under material ( see pics)  * Coloring is a dark green but does have some areas of slightly lighter appearance. Professional cleaning or dressing may offer some improvement (see pics).    Mechanical   Test drive  Chad rode with the owner for about a 5 mile ride in the country. Chad then drove back on different road conditions. The engine and transmission seemed to perform smoothly and correctly. Car steered, turned, stopped, and accelerated as you would expect. Braking was smooth without pulsation or pulling. Ride was beautifully smooth and quiet. I would say the car pretty much operated as it was designed to. Premium fuel and lead additive recommended.  $18,100"

This Lola T492 is one of the nicest Sports 2000 cars you will find. With approximately $50,000 in recent maintenance and upgrades, this one is ready to go. It is mechanically sound with a recent engine rebuild and many other items as described below. Further, it looks fantastic with recent paint and body work along with the plated roll bars. There is also a nice cache of documentation and spare parts. While you may find plenty of old race cars on the market, few offer this level of readiness. The first of the cars three logbooks was issued by the SCCA on September 9, 1978 for the SR2000 class. Its first recorded race was an SCCA event at Lake Erie in May 1979. It was subsequently raced throughout the United States (SCCA) and Canada (CRDA). It was later raced in vintage classes with SVRA, HSR, and VS2NA. It was most recently on the track at Road America in April 2023. This car has seen three stages of rebuild and refurbishment in recent years, thus its exceptional condition. The first ran from 2010-2012 and consisted of new plating on the tub, new skid plates, replacement of the roll bar and bracing, nickel-plated bulkheads, Kephos upright coating, and fresh outer tub skins. The rear subframe was media blasted, repaired, and powder coated, while a replacement fiberglass body from Motorsport Composites was fitted. Both the engine and gearbox were rebuilt as were the suspension and braking systems. New wheel bearings, hubs, and CV joints werealso installed. Finally, the car received newrain and brake lights along with headlight wiring.  The second stage of refurbishment was from 2019-2021. This involved replacing all rod ends, the fuel cell, and the fire suppression system. The roll bars were extended and now reach to the drivers feet. A carbon fiber splitter was fabricated and installed along with a new wicker bill. The rear disc brakes were moved outboard for improved cooling and easier maintenance. The car also received new Koni double-adjustable shocks and Aurora rod ends. A quick-release OMP steering wheel, RGE wiring harness, and Racetech instruments were also installed along with a fuel gauge. In addition, the engine received a fresh rebuild and a new Fireball ignition, throttle cable mount, and Burns stainless steel exhaust. This was followed by a third stage of work completed in early 2023.The body was sent out for a variety of fiberglass repairs along with a full repaint. The seat was reconfigured from a custom molded unit to a new Kirkey setup with fabricated brackets. This arrangement offers far more flexibility for the next owner, though the old Lola fiberglass seat is also included. Note the Sabelt six-point harness is good through 2024. Finally, a nut-and-bolt check was performed followed by track time at Road America in April 2023. This Lolas drivetrain starts with a Ford 2.0L inline-4 with a dry sump oiling system, Mocal oil cooler, and Weber carburetor. Its most recent rebuild was in 2021 by Elite Engines of West Bend, WI with only 9.0 hours since. The fuel pump, fuel lines, test port, and filter were all replaced as well. Cooling is provided by dual side mount aluminum radiators with updated water pipes and blue SAMCO hoses. The transaxle is a Hewland Mk9 dog box 4-speed that was rebuilt by Averill Racing Stuff with a new ring and pinion, shift forks and springs, reverse idler gear, pinion bearing, and input shaft seal. The hydraulic clutch received a new release bearing, master / slave cylinders, and a reinforced clutch arm. Braking is provided by Wilwood 4-piston calipers, vented floating rotors with alloy hats, Hawk brake pads, powder coated hard lines, and a Raceparts bias adjuster. The black 13 Revolution alloy wheels wear Avon racing tires. Literature includes the previously mentioned log books along with Lola system diagrams, Ford and Hewland data sheets, and a setup notebook. Spare parts include extra wheels and tires, eight additional gear sets, a fiberglass seat, intake manifold, coilovers, starters, brake cooling ducts, and many other miscellaneous parts as shown in the gallery. Also included are the spats that were removed from behind the rear tires. Note this vehicle is not street legal and does not have a title; ownership will be transferred via bill of sale only. The S2000 class is very popular and offers plenty of racing opportunities on a reasonable budget. Further, this Lola is easy to drive and will perform at the limit, with lap times in the upper 2:20s at Road America (most recently run in April 2023). It is in race-ready condition and has been professionally maintained by Wynnfurst Racing for the last few years. Whether you are looking to venture into amateur racing or augment an existing stable, this one has a lot to offer.   $49,500"

The owner took the photos. The car is well documented and has 2 ring binders of paperwork. We will show some of the documents in our photos. There is the Marti Report as well as the original Ford dealer order. There are also receipts for almost every part changed or added to the car. Our seller purchased the car about 3 years ago. The books that came with it document everything right down to a wiper switch and battery hold down. Other examples are the installation of the 15\"Magnum 500 wheels in 1995, motor rebuilt in 1996, front end rebuilt in 2017 with the addition of disc brakes at that time. Since our seller purchased the car there is a grocery list of items that he either installed, upgraded or replaced. He did not change the car in any way that would take away from it's matching numbers originality, just improved a great car. He also kept any original part he may have removed. Here is just a recap of most of them. As I mentioned before, there are receipts for all major parts and everything the previous owner did. You will receive the books with the car. The 8-Track rebuild cost over $1200. alone. This is a very nice Mach 1. The current owner knew it had some cosmetic issues, which we show in our later photos, but it did not bother him. It is hard to find a really nice matching numbers documented Mach 1 today. According to the Marti Report, this car is one of only 2987 produced with this engine and transmission set up and one of only 1952 with this exact paint and trim combination. He is very meticulous and mechanically you won't have to do a thing to this car. It runs and drives great. We are limited to the number of photos in our ads, but if you are a serious buyer, I can send almost 200 photos in a file. Please be sure to watch the video to hear this car run. Feel free to call me at any time with questions, which I am sure you will have. Call 214-616-2317. I can also assist with shipping and financing. Thank you for viewing our ad.  $52,500"

This Trans Am features a nice repaint in factory Yellow, a beautiful mostly stock interior, a good running Pontiac 400 engine and a four speed manual transmission. This Trans Am is finished in the beautiful and desirable color combinations of Yellow over Black vinyl interior. This is the factory color scheme as verified on the trim tag pictured above. This factory color combination is fairly rare and I have not seen many in this color scheme over the years. Exterior  The Yellow exterior is in good overall stock condition. This Trans Am has nice Yellow paint and was repainted 26 years ago. The paint is in good overall condition and still shines well but has a few blemishes due to age around the car. The decals still look great and the emblems show well around the car. There are some minor imperfections and paint touch ups that may not be noticeable in the photos, but nothing was intentionally excluded from the photos. The tires have good tread left and the OEM rally wheels are in great shape with no curb rash and come with original trim rings. All weather stripping and window sweeps are in good condition. Trunk is solid and clean with the original space saver spare tire and jack, with a felt trunk mat. This TA was rust proofed when new and much of the undercoating is still visible on the underside of this car.  Interior  The Black vinyl interior of this Trans Am is in very nice stock condition. The seat covers are in great overall condition. There are no rips or stains and the seats are super comfortable. The carpet is in great condition with no major wear, but there is a mar in the rear passenger area. The original dash is in excellent condition with no fading, cracks, or warping and the dash bezel is in good condition. The stereo was upgraded years ago to a after market Pioneer CD/MP3 player and new front and rear speakers were added. The system sounds great and offers a lot of musical variety. The door panels are in great shape and both door pulls are solid and in tact. The headliner and package tray are in good overall condition but the headliner is drooping on the sides. All interior lights and gauges work as they should outside of the clock. The stereo, horn, wipers, and blower motor also work. This car has not been smoked in; there is no aroma what so ever.   Mechanical  This Trans Am is in good mechanical condition and comes with a good running Pontiac 400 engine and a four speed manual transmission. The engine was rebuilt around 26 years ago when the car was repainted. Approximately 25,000 miles have been added since the restoration 26 years ago. This Trans Am is a good driver that feels good on the roads. There is no smoke when starting or driving the car. It starts right away every time, idles well, and runs good. The Dynomax muffler was recently added and a newer style cat was added at some point. Also, the engine is clean and nicely detailed as one can see from the photos. This is a factory NON AC car which really cleans up the engine bay and adds to performance.       $29,900 (OBO)"

Seats are comfortable and there are seat belts for all 5 seating positions. Dash is beautiful with no cracks. All gauges, lights, radio, wipers, and heater work great. Power top goes up and down perfectly. Top in good condition with no cuts or holes and has a crystal clear rear glass. Top boot cover (for when top is down) is original and a little crispy with some discoloration. Replacements are readily available if you wanted to replace it. I think it looks good enough to retain the original.  The powerful 350 V8 runs great and does not smoke. The 3 speed transmission shifts great. Rear axle seals and brakes were just serviced. Optioned with power steering and power disc brakes.   Paint is gorgeous, very straight, fully sanded and buffed to a show quality mirror finish.

        "text": "Jeep Grand Wagoneer 1987 $109,900  Frame off restoration undergoing mechanical and cosmetic works with estimated completion date of thirdquarter2024 Reserve Now!  Grand Wagoneer by Classic Gentleman, internationally recognized as a leading buyer, restorer and seller of low mile, excellent condition Grand Wagoneers, presents this low 108,xxx original mile 1987 Grand Wagoneer. .Until our purchase, her entire registered life was deep in the state of Texas She has never seen any winter road salt ever, not even any snow ever, (But snow doesnt hurt a Grand anyway. it is the corrosive road salt). Since she hasnt been exposed to road salt, her frame and undercarriage are solid and making her worthy of the investment required in a Classic Gentleman restoration. There is nothing more important for a 35 year old Grand Wagoneer than it comes from the right areas of the country that have kept their frames and undercarriages out of the winter road salt. Frankly for us, it is the difference between a restoration candidate or a parts car. Carfax confirms the lifetime Texas registration, no accidents reported and the low 108,xxx miles as original and true. (That works out to just a little more than 3,000 miles per year.). We have scheduled this 87 to be finished in the popular and seen next to never gorgeous Spinnaker Blue Metallic paint finish but there is still time for the next owner to pick whatever color they would like. Have a look at the restoration page on our website to see how considerable our full color conversion process is. Here is just one specific, we even paint the metal floors under the new floor carpeting the new color. OUR FRAME OFF RESTORATION PROCESS Exterior cosmetic restoration works: Interior cosmetic restoration works: Electrical/mechanical works: Engine: Modern fuel injection includes: Transmission & 4 wheel drive systems Air conditioning & coolant systems Braking, wheel components & undercarriage Key electrical components & parts replaced Why buy from a Grand Wagoneer specialist? Our entire focus is on Grand Wagoneers and we know these unique vehicles inside and out. When you purchase a Classic Gentleman Wagoneer it has been thoroughly inspected and works completed by professional mechanics, some with over forty years of Wagoneer experience. We purchase fine example Jeeps from a variety of sources including other dealers and private parties. We are often told by the seller, My Jeep is excellent and needs nothing however, being in this profession, we know to expect and plan for a great deal of sorting. Remember the average age of these vehicles is over thirty years old and even with loving care many the cosmetics and mechanical parts have aged and worn accordingly. When a Classic Gentleman Grand Wagoneer arrives at your home, it is a special occasion and the Grand will be in beautiful condition. Yes, our sales are as-is, but as you will see from our detailed document files that your Grand has been looked after carefully. Our goal is to see that the joy and enthusiasm of Grand Wagoneer ownership begins immediately with your purchase and that it will be there for years to come.

        "text": "Chevrolet Impala SS 1962 $49,500  All vehicle trades considered including classics and performance. We can assist with financing and shipping as needed. This 1962 Impala SS has a lot to offer. To begin, this is a real black-over-red Impala SS; no color changes or fake badging here. It underwent a refurbishment in 2010 that included new paint and many new parts. It still wears a number of period modifications from the 1960s and is powered by a fresh dual-quad 327. And while some of these classics change owners frequently, this Impala has been with the same individual for 55 years! This one has a colorful history. Its last owner purchased the car in 1968 when he was 16 years old. The car was well-known on the street and had been fitted a variety of performance parts. This included a Corvette 327 fitted with a cross-ram intake (necessitating the teardrop style hood). While the car won plenty of races, it was also the owners primary transportation, getting him through high school and then tech school. They continued through life together. After decades of service, the car received a major refurbishment in 2010. This included replacing the floor pans, trunk pans, and some cross bracing. It was repainted in its original code 900 Tuxedo Black with four coats of clear. It was recently buffed as well for a nice shine. Most of the brightwork remains original including the front grille. The car was also fitted with 15 Weld aluminum wheels and Goodyear Eagle tires.  The 327ci engine received a professional rebuild by Dick Skarlupka in 2019 with approximately 4,000 miles since. The 3782870 block was bored 0.060 while the crankshaft was turned 0.010/0.010. It was fitted with 10.5:1 pistons to give healthy compression but still work with pump gas. The rotating assembly was balanced to 9,000 rpm for smooth operation. The valvetrain was fitted with hydraulic lifters and roller rockers, and the double-hump cylinder heads received hardened valve seats. Up top is the vintage Edelbrock X-C8 intake topped by dual Holley carburetors. Such a great period setup! There is also a 4-core radiator and headers feeing a dual exhaust with cutout plates. The automatic transmission was upgraded from a 2-speed Powerglide to a 3-speed TH350 with a shift kit and lockup torque converter. The driveshaft was rebuilt accordingly and a new center support bearing installed. The Positraction rear end received new bearings and seals. Additional mechanical work included going through the front and rear suspension along with the steering components, and the braking system was upgraded to front discs with a dual reservoir master cylinder. The factory code 875 red vinyl SS interior received some updates too. The bucket seats were redone with new foam and upholstery, while front and rear seat belts were installed. The carpet was replaced and comes with a set of rubber floor mats. A trio of underdash gauges was installed along with a column mounted tachometer. All the lighting works properly including the low / high beams, running lights, brake lights, turn signals, backup lights, dash lights, and courtesy lights. The horn, wipers, heater, and parking brake all function properly as does the aftermarket digital radio. A spare tire and bumper jack reside in the cavernous trunk. This Impala just oozes character! It is a beautiful, solid car with a great blend of vintage and current upgrades. And with all the recent work it is in excellent mechanical condition as well. While you may be able to find another nice black/red 62 SS, this example is a real standout and has an incredible run of ownership. You wont find many like this one.  $49,500"

First owner was a woman who drove the car for only a few years, second owner bought and sold it to his friend who has kept the car for 45 years. In 1982, 41years ago he had it repainted in the original color and he had the interior redone at the same time. Except for that the Mustang has been used sparingly, it today has128.500 original miles on it. The 302 engine has never been worked on and itruns absolutely excellent still. The transmission was rebuilt recently. The car drivesalmost like a Cadillac, no rattles or strange noises and it runsand drives down the road probably as well as it did in 1973. The car is not a show car but an excellent driver as is. It needs nothing to be used for local car shows or on Sunday trips with your sweetheart! And it is pricedaccordingly.

The 3rd generation Continental was produced form 1958  1960 and marked a significant body design to separate itself from the Mercury line to enable Lincoln to outdo Cadillac. With an overall length of 227 inches the 3rd generation Continentals were the longest mass produced vehicle ever sold in the U.S with the exception of the very rare 34-37 Cadillac V16 convertibles. For 1959 the Mark IV saw minor changes with the restyled grill that enabled the headlights cluster to be integrated into the egg crate grille. Standard equipment is the 430 ci V8 mated to a 3 speed Turbo-Drive automatic transmission. This particular example was finished in a gorgeous Copper Poly paint with a Glacier White vinyl interior and top. It is nicely optioned with 6-way power seats, power locks, power vent windows, a heater & defroster, a locking gas cap, rocker panel moldings, a Travel Tuner AM radio with dual speakers and white sidewall tires. It is a 4 owner car with 97,846 original miles and everything is 100% original with no restoration work of any kind having been done. It was just serviced and tuned up. The tires and battery were changed not long ago so she is in need of nothing but a new home. Based on its present condition and factoring in the flaws you will find in the paint, interior and trim work we would classify this as # 3 vehicle and as such would appraise it at $48,700. We are serious about finding it a new home and have priced it accordingly. If you have been looking for one of these you know what you have just found so you best contact us before it is too late!  $29,900"

Internally referred to as W121 (BII or B2), it was first shown in prototype at the 1954 New York Auto Show, and was available with an optional removable hardtop.The 190 SL was powered by a new, slightly oversquare 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) Type M121 BII 1.9 L straight-four SOHC engine. Based on the 300 SL's straight six, it had an unchanged 85 mm bore and 4.3 mm reduced 83.6 mm stroke, was fitted with twin-choke dual Solex carburetors, and produced gross 120 hp (89 kW; 122 PS). In detuned form, it was later used in the W120 180 and W121 190 models. Description: This is an unfinished Mercedes-Benz 190 SL project. Finished the throughly prepping process, the car was painted original white color . Painting process started with epoxy primer, seam sealer and finished with high grade PPG paint. Result was a perfect \"bondo free\" smooth body. Many interior parts were already redone, but there are still some parts to be properly finished. All brakes, suspension, sub-frame, Differential and miscellaneous parts were carefully media blasted, and are ready installed back to the car.  $87,500 (OBO)"

Other notable options this Charger features are bucket seats, power steering, tachometer, interior light package, hood mount turn signals, AM w/ 8 track, and more.

Purchased new by the current owner's grandfather on March 26, 1963, at Ames Ford in San Rafael California. This special example left the factory in Rangoon Red with a red interior, a 390 cubic inch V8 with a 4bbl carburetor paired to a Cruise-a-Matic, a 3.00:1 ratio axle, and power steering. It has been garaged and pampered since new and it shows. It includes the original owner's manual and information tags. The exterior still wears its original Rangoon Red paint which has held up phenomenally. The chrome, trim, emblems, hubcaps, original issue black & gold California license plates, glass, and lenses are equally well-preserved making this attractive old Galaxie an anomaly and a glimpse of 60 years into the past. Inside is equally as amazing and completely original including upholstery, door cards, panels, headliner, dash, gauges, and even the carpet is factory original. The car is comfortable and quiet inside with all working gauges, the only inoperable item is the clock. It is a lovely ride indeed. The trunk still has its original panel cars, mat, spare, and jack instructions. The original factory 390 cubic inch engine fires up effortlessly and has excellent power. It runs smoothly, quietly, and burns clean. The braking, steering, and handling feel tight though the steering rack is leaking and should be renewed in the not-too-distant future. It is a truly amazing experience to drive such a low-mileage, well-preserved vintage Ford! Be sure to check out all 370 photos and the video at www.leftcoastclassics.com.

To reduce weight the brakes, clutch, and transmission were eliminated. They are a direct chain drive that are push started. Racers were generally factory sponsored in the early days of racing, but if you were not factory sponsored you were known as a Privateer. The paint detail on this bike is based upon a Privateer racer of the day except for the paint color combination which was not adopted by Harley Davidson until much later. The white tires are made from natural rubber and were quite popular at the time. These motorcycles were normally raced on hardwood racetracks and thus were commonly referred to as board track racers and they obtained a top speed of over 100 miles per hour.  NOTE: When this motorcycle was manufactured titling was not required and therefore, because this is as racer no title was ever issued for this motorcycle, so it comes with a Bill of Sale only.  $34,900"

Take a good look at this custom built bike by Ashcroft Motorcycles. This bike is well thought out, and customized in such a way that you can actually ride it anywhere. The engine fires right up and runs great, like an Evo should. The 5 speed transmission shifts smoothly with it's new clutch assembly, and all components on the bike work as they should. The exhaust system gives a nod to the Choppers of the 1960's, and assists the big V-Twin in making it's signature rumble.

This is my personal car that I have decided to let go of as I'm downsizing my small collection. It was purchased new in California and has remained here since new. It comes with a clear, California title and clean Carfax report. The 3.0 Liter engine starts easily, runs and idles smoothly and clean with plenty of power, and passes the California smog inspection without issue. The shifting is tight along with the braking and handling. It is a very nice driving W126 all around. The exterior shows nicely and all of the paint looks to be original and well-preserved with only the front left fender looking to have been repainted. The trim, glass, and lenses all look nice however the chromed factory wheels are corroded so its new owner may wish to strip and repaint. Otherwise, it's a great-looking car that appears to have spent most of its life indoors. The interior is immaculate. The leather on the front seats is in excellent condition having been covered in sheepskin for years. All systems are in very good working order though recently the radio reception has failed. The gauges, switches, horn, and lights all work well and the air conditioning blows cool at 62f though I will add a can of refrigerant to top it off before delivery/shipping. The trunk is equally nice with tools, jack, and spare all present. You'll notice in the trunk the personalized \"W126\" California license plates, these were on the car when I purchased and I am happy to transfer them to the new owner should they decide to use them. Be sure to check out the nearly 300 photos and the video at www.leftcoastclassics.com. Call or text Donn with questions. 707-332-8331.  $7,500 (OBO)"

        "text": "Chevrolet K-10 1970 $114,995  What would Chevrolet do if they built a 1970 K-10 in vintage style today? That is exactly the question that this restoration project was designed around. Built in the factory as a K-10 Short Box with 4x4 option, the restoration was completed by the very talented JD Lusardi at Street Rod Factory in Mountain Home, Idaho, a builder with Riddler Award winning involvement in his history. According to the owner and JD, no stone was left unturned in this frame-off restoration. Now sporting a rebuilt LS V8 and rebuilt 4L60e automatic transmission, the truck now has the power needed to feel like a modern sports truck. Everything underneath was powder coated and polished where possible to create a beautiful show piece. A Rough Country 4 inch lift was installed to better fit the white lettered 33 tires, which are wrapped on 18 Detroit Steel Smoothie wheels. These wheels are retrofitted to fit the factory dog dish hubcaps for the true vintage look. Looking around the exterior, the Chevrolet Victory Red color may have never looked so good with lots of clear coat sprayed on top, sanded and polished as best as possible. An all new bed and floor were installed to insure no filler or rust, and every piece of chrome is new on top of that. Inside, the all new interior features a beautiful leather wrapped bench seat, dash cover and door cards. To keep it still vintage style, the builders opted for keeping the manual crank windows and leaving the headlight dimmer switch on the floor. Modern touches such as a retro looking radio with Bluetooth, Dakota Digital retro looking gauge cluster with LED displays, and Vintage Air keep the ride comfortable and modern. Whether you are looking for a show truck or one to enjoy, this K10 4x4 is an excellent option for either.  Restoration Highlights Include: Rebuilt 2005 LS V8 Reworked Heads with Larger Valves and Stiffer Springs Larger Camshaft New Water Pump New Oil Pump Rebuilt 4L60E Transmission Flowmaster Mufflers Rebuilt Transfer Case New Front and Rear Axles - 3:73 Ratio New Vintage Air System Dakota Digital Gauges And Much More  VIN: CS140Z160860 Mileage Shown at Listing: 28  Please contact us with any questions, for more information or a shipping quote.  $114,995"

One of the most significant show cars built in this era of the Ghia-Ford relationship is the Megastar. With a very exaggerated \"greenhouse\" feel on the outside and inside with amazing visibility, the sides of the car are 80% glass! Aerodynamics were in full effect with a wedge shape, low centre of gravity and round smooth sides, this was the beginnings of the modern supercar age where this shape defined the futuristic supercars of the era. It certainly was influenced by a few previous Italian designs such as the 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo concept by Bertone, the Ferrari P5 and P6 by Pininfarina and of course Ghias own DeTomaso Mangusta and Pantera designs. Based on the Ford Granada chassis, the Megastar is powered by a pretty powerful 3 liter V6 and an automatic transmission for comfort. It even has dual exhaust that has a pretty aggressive tone. The inside certainly has an Italian feel with a leather wrapped dash and Italian sport steering wheel, but the shapes are very futuristic with a mid-century twist with square shaped gauges and a mechanical analog clock smack center of the dash. Four color keyed bucket style seats with very defined futuristic cushions give it a very spaceship feel. Originally upon its completion, the Megastar was revealed at the 1977 Geneva motor show where I am sure it gained some big attention. It was also shown at the 1978 Chicago auto show on the Ford stand. From then on the Megastar disappeared into the storage facilities of the Ford Motor Company. Now on offer for the first time and in fully serviced running and driving condition. Contact us today for more information  $125,000"

The name \"Hudson\" came fromJoseph L. Hudson, a Detroit department store entrepreneur and founder ofHudson'sdepartment store, who provided the necessary capital and gave permission for the company to be named after him. Hudson caused great excitement to the U.S. auto industry with its new step-down unibody in 1948. The unibody made the Hudson Commodore lighter and stiffer than more conventional designs, and also reduced weight, all of which meant the cars were actually quite capable. The new design was aerodynamic and surprisingly fast and set the car apart from most everything else on the road. Coming to us from a well-known Hudson collector, RB Collection is pleased to offer this rare, desirable, and meticulously restored 1949 Hudson Commodore Convertible Brougham Model equipped with a Super Eight 254-cid, 128-hp straight-eight engine, VIN 494153232, with an attractive Roman Red paint over an exquisite burgundy leather interior and convertible top.  The low center of gravity and powerful eight-cylinder engines made Hudsons some of the best-performing postwar cars and they have become collectors' favorites. This 1949 Hudson Commodore 8 convertible is a perfect example of the appeal of these cars. Powered by the 128hp 254 cubic inch eight-cylinder engine, it has been thoroughly restored to pristine condition with excellent paint, a gorgeous interior, sharp chrome, and a thoroughly prepared and cleanly presented engine compartment. It has a 3-speed manual transmission, hubcaps, trim rings, wide whitewalls, rear wheel fender skirts, power windows, radio, heater, power top, grille guard, and the original Owners Manual. We are very pleased to offer this outstanding example with exceptional restoration as a rare opportunity of acquiring a vehicle that represents American history.

The B introduced new front and rear sheet-metal, while retaining the curved front trunk lid and rounded fenders of the A series. The B also added some features requested by American customers, such as raised front and rear bumpers with over-riders to better protect the body from parking incidents. The headlamps were raised, a larger hood handle was added, and front vent windows appeared in the doors. A new steering wheel and column similarly refreshed the interior, along with redesigned rear seats. The 356 B also reflected Porsches continuing effort to improve the lines mechanical components, with stronger engine internals, transaxle, shifting linkage, and better Alfin brakes.

Less than ten thousand Citations were built, and this restored example is finished in the factory Frost White and gold and is complimented by cloth upholstery in the same colors. The car features a Teletouch push-button actuated automatic transmission found on the center of the steering wheel. Other features include a rotating carousel-style speedometer, along with other amenities such as power windows. Mechanically, the car is equipped with coil spring front suspension and a four-barrel carburetor. The five-digit odometer shows 79,038 miles, but the actual mileage is unknown. It is located in Englewood, Colorado The third-party photos and inspection represent well the condition of this Edsel. The car was restored by the owning family around 2007, and the condition is evident in the photos. Further restoration photos are available. The exterior white paint shows typical scratches and chips that one would expect on a car of this age. Small spots of surface rust can be seen on the interior and exterior of the vehicle, and the cars power steering has limited functionality. The interior of the car is a matching two-tone white and gold with the hallmarks of fifties styling. Some wear on the dash and minor wear in the upholstery are evident, and there is also a crack in one of the lower shrouds of one of the seats, and the radio does not currently function. Mechanically, the car runs and drives as intended by the manufacturer. The car is in overall good condition and still reflects the older restoration performed. The original owners manual and one set of keys are included in the sale.  This Edsel is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Englewood, CO.  About the model The Edsel Citation was a family of full-size cars that debuted for the 1958 model year. The Citation was offered in two-door hardtop, four-door hardtop, and two-door convertible body styles and was Edsel's flagship model. This family of rear-wheel drive cars was powered by a 6.7L V8 engine paired with a three-speed manual transmission. Due to Edsel's commercial failure, the Citation was only offered for the 1958 model year before being discontinued, with a total of 9,299 examples made.

Restored around 1990 and includes some records, a photo album of the build, and a clear California title. The 1991cc inline 4-cylinder Triumph engine was rebuilt 12k miles ago.

It has excellent braking with new rear shoes and cylinders installed and newer front brakes as well. The front suspension was renewed fairly recently so handing is nice making for a fun driving experience. The cockpit is comfortable and complete with all gauges and lights/blinkers in good working order. The interior is clean, comfortable, and ready to enjoy. The outside was restored years ago and shows well though there is some blistering in the paint which I've covered in detail in the video. The top and side curtains are in good shape with nice fitment. The wire wheels are wrapped in an older set of Firestone 165 R15s with plenty of treads but should eventually be replaced due to age.

        "text": "Chevrolet Corvette 1979 $24,900  All vehicle trades considered including classics and performance. We can assist with financing and shipping as needed. Here is a vintage Corvette that is much more affordable than so many others but is still an exceptional car. We are talking about a 1979 model with the optional L82 engine, rare M21 close-ratio 4-speed transmission (7.5% of production), glass T-tops, air conditioning, Gymkhana suspension, aluminum wheels, power windows, and more. It looks fantastic, is very fun to drive, and has a long maintenance history. Further, this Corvette is exceptionally well documented with a GM invoice, original bill of sale, dealer paperwork, financing records, and receipts dating to the early 80s. This C3 has only had two owners and shows 67k miles. Built in St. Louis in March 1979, it was sold new at Adcox-Kirby Chevrolet in Chattanooga, TN and remained with its original owner until 2020. It still looks great in its dark blue metallic paint and glass T-tops (which are etched with the last six digits of the VIN). This one also has the optional D35 sport mirrors and the N90 slotted aluminum wheels with brand new 255/60R15 tires. Everything looks factory stock; no add-on spoilers, badges, luggage rack, or other such items. Under the hood is the higher performance L82 engine rated at 225hp. Here too everything appears original though the single catalytic converter has been removed and a true dual exhaust installed. The oil pan has been replaced also. The engine starts right up, has a nice idle, and moves this 79 right along. The M21 close-ratio 4-speed (which was only available with the L82) shifts smoothly through all the gears and really adds to the fun factor of any C3. Additional features include power steering and power 4-wheel disc brakes. The fully independent suspension was factory equipped with the FE7 Gymkhana setup and has four new shock absorbers. The optional black leather interior appears stock as well. The seats received new foam and upholstery in 2022 so they feel as good as they look. Additional interior options include a tilt / telescoping steering column, power windows, and an electric rear window defogger. The car was also equipped with factory air conditioning thathas been converted to R134a. There is also a vintage dealer installed AM/FM/CB radio with a working 8-track tape player! Note the CB antenna has been removed. The headlights, wipers, heater, defroster, horn, turn signals, parking brake, courtesy lights, and power windowsall work properly. There are plenty of C3 Corvettes on the market but not many like this one. Aside from being in remarkable condition, it has a great list of performance options and features that can be hard to find. It also has documentation that you dont often get with a car from this era. Yet all this is priced less than the dealer mark-up on a C8 Z06, making it a perfect way to join the Corvette club without breaking the bank.   $24,900"

        "text": "Pontiac GTO 1969 $87,000  Details This fully restored 1969 Pontiac GTO shows just 27,523 miles, although the actual mileage is unknown. This American muscle car is powered by a Ram-Air 400ci V8 engine with the last six digits of the VIN matching the last six of the engine block stamping. Power from the V8 runs through a Muncie four-speed manual transmission to the rear wheels. The car was sold new at Star Pontiac of Washington D.C. and still wears the correct Starlight Black (10A) paint with an Ivory white convertible top and matching Parchment (257) white vinyl upholstery. This GTO was equipped with front power disc brakes along with power windows and steering. Other features include the hood-mounted tachometer and Endura front bumper. The car was the recipient of a frame-off restoration by a previous owner at an unknown date. It is currently in Warren, New Jersey. The quality of the restoration performed on this vehicle is evident in the third-party photos and inspection. The black paint is deep and shows well in the photos. The hideaway headlights and power top both function as they should. The Rally wheels are also in good condition, but the next owner will need to monitor the tread depth of the tires. The Parchment colored interior has no rips or wear, and the dash shows no cracks. The teak wood three-spoke steering wheel is also in good restored condition. The inspection report includes a video of the engine idling smoothly, and a test drive revealed the vehicle to be in good working order. This Pontiac GTO is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Warren, New Jersey. Financing options are available through our recommended lenders. Please find options here. About the model The second generation of Pontiac GTO was introduced in 1968. The second-gen GTO saw updated styling, and various mechanical upgrades, as well as the introduction of a 455 cu. in. V8 in 1971. One of the most notable GTO variants were cars fitted with The Judge package, that was a stripped GTO made to compete with the Plymouth Road Runner. For 1972, the GTO returned to being an option package for the Pontiac LeMans.

They were functional, tough, and always had the needed accessories to pull off the rescue or get-a-way. Black Horse Garage is proud to represent this adventure truck, a 1972 Chevrolet K20 pickup. For this truck, Black Horse Garage drew inspiration from the action TV series The Fall Guy. While its not the same make or color as that one, we were looking for a similar feel. This K 20 has been blacked out everywhere including tinting the windshield and windows. Like the Fall Guy, we added a roll bar with 8-inch KC lights, side steps, a front bully bar, and KC off-road lights. That was just the beginning though. Here is a list of some improvements made and accessories added on at Black Horse Garage: One of the biggest things we did was give the K20 power steering with the EZ Electric power steering kit. It makes the truck easy to drive, steer, and handles tremendously. Its a lot of truck! All action trucks have a larger than life feel and this one is no exception. It has been given a lift with a Rough Country 4-inch lift kit. Five-inch leaf spring bolts and new killer Nitto Ridge Grappler tires complete the look. This K20 is a beast, so it has to sound good as well. We installed Flowmaster headers that have the most aggressive sound in the Flowmaster line. It also has a Flowmaster universal exhaust kit. The kit has cross pipes with cutouts that balance the exhaust pulses for increased torque and horsepower. We had to install a 120-amp alternator to handle all the additional power needs for the Chevy truck. It has LED lights inside and out. Modern and vintage are mixed together with an Alpine Apple Play digital multimedia receiver with 7-inch touchscreen and a CB radio with whip antenna. Safety features are abundant as well with not only a back-up camera, but two side cameras with an independent viewscreen. The K20 has less than 39k miles on it. It is powered by a Chevy 350, 5.7 -liter V-8 engine with a 4-barrel carburetor. It has a 4-speed manual transmission and is a 44.

The car is finished in Burgundy (N-N) over a Black (223) interior and came equipped with a WT code 389, 4-speed transmission, and 3.55 rear end. The car is PHS documented and received a GM Award of Excellence at Carlisle in 2010 shortly after the restoration was completed. The car is the result of a frame-off rotisserie restoration and it is drop-dead gorgeous. The bodywork on the car is very straight, and the gaps on the GTO are tight and nice throughout. The glass is all in very good condition and was replaced during the restoration. All of the chrome is new and all of the stainless is either new or restored. All of the rubber seals on the car were done as well at the time of the restoration. Overall, its a beautiful show car. While the body was off the frame, the frame was stripped to bare metal and refinished in the proper GM satin black. All the suspension and steering components were replaced as well including all of the bushings, tie rods, ball joints, and brake components. The steering gearbox was also upgraded to a quicker ratio 12:1 unit. The interior is all redone and looks crisp. The dash has the factory tach, and the car is equipped with a factory console and push-button radio. All soft panels are new including the seat covers, door panels, carpets, carpet underlayment, headliner, dash, and package tray. The engine was cast on March 10th, 1966 and the engine casting number is 9778789. Its important to note that GM did not stamp VIN codes on these motors until late 1967, so calling them \"matching numbers\" would not be the correct usage of the term. What we can say about this car is that the engine was cast a few months before the build date of the car and that it is a WT code that matches the PHS docs we have with the car. During the restoration, a Tri-Power setup was added to the car, however, the correct 4bbl intake, carb, and air cleaner have been retained with the GTO. The GTO is equipped with the correct 4-speed wide ratio transmission and YH safety track 3.55 gears. The car runs very well, is properly tuned, and is a blast to drive. With the faster ratio power steering and power brakes, its also easy to maneuver, and with the 3.55 gears, you get a good balance of quick acceleration and easy highway cruising. For the GTO nut wanting a PHS documented, drop-dead gorgeous Goat, this one is for you!  $85,900 (OBO)"

Grand Wagoneer by Classic Gentleman, internationally recognized as a leading buyer, restorer and seller of low mile, excellent condition Grand Wagoneers, presents this factory original color Hunter Green Metallic 1991 Final Edition. At a time when many collector vehicles seem to be reaching benchmark prices, the 1991 factory original color Hunter Green Jeep Grand Wagoneer is truly a benchmark standout. 1991 was the final year for this iconic precursor to the modern SUV. Wikipedia details only 1560 Grand Wagoneers rolled off the Toledo assembly line in 1991 and whilst other sources quote slightly higher final year production numbers, still 1991 is the lowest production year as Chrysler ended production on June 21th, 1991. A fresh new color was added to the line and it would only be produced in the final year  HUNTER GREEN METALLIC. This unique color would be selected to represent the Grand Wagoneer in the Chrysler Museum and the last Grand to complete on that final day was also a Hunter Green model. Even from the start the factory execs knew this was one beautiful color contrasting with the wood tone applique. How rare are these? The most often quoted production number is 150  that number could be plus or minus a few  but you get the idea- they are really rare. Few vehicles in modern automotive history have been produced in such limited numbers. Each time we acquire a 91 Hunter Green Grand Wagoneer we feel quite fortunate that we have the opportunity to restore one to its original glory. This is truly a Benchmark vehicle for the discerning collector . Industry experts predict that Grand Wagoneers will continue to appreciate in the coming years and that 1991 models will be at the forefront of that appreciation- especially the rare Hunter Green edition. This investment grade Final Edition was just a two owner piece until our acquisition and apart from our purchase, the only state shown on the Carfax is the southern state of Arkansas. Her former owners cherished this Grand and past down from one to the other was the original window sticker. ($30,289.00 was the sticker price, if your are curious). The 147,200 miles are shown as actual (still under 5,000 miles per year) with no accidents reported against her. The frame off restoration is extensive, from a newly remanufactured original spec 360ci V8 engine, rebuilt transmission to a whole host of other cosmetic and mechanical/electrical works with the highlights detailed below: OUR FRAME OFF RESTORATION PROCESS Exterior cosmetic restoration works: Interior cosmetic restoration works: Electrical/mechanical works: Engine: Modern fuel injection includes: Transmission & 4 wheel drive systems Air conditioning & coolant systems Braking, wheel components & undercarriage Key electrical components & parts replaced Our entire focus is on Grand Wagoneers and we know these unique vehicles inside and out. When you purchase a Classic Gentleman Wagoneer it has been thoroughly inspected and works completed by professional mechanics, some with over forty years of Wagoneer experience. We purchase fine example Jeeps from a variety of sources including other dealers and private parties. We are often told by the seller, My Jeep is excellent and needs nothing however, being in this profession, we know to expect and plan for a great deal of sorting. Remember the average age of these vehicles is over thirty years old and even with loving care many the cosmetics and mechanical parts have aged and worn accordingly.

The Acapulco Thing was built from May to July 1974 only, and a mere 400 were produced in total. All were white with blue accents on the front hood, the rocker panels, the bumpers and the dashboard. The seats were upholstered in a blue-and-white striped fabric, and the same fabric was used for the standard surrey top that was stretched over a metal tube frame. This car is a true time capsule wearing its original paint (with the exception of drivers front fender due to a minor scratch years ago) Paint shows nicely with a little fade from age and minor scratch's, chips, and imperfection from use over the years. Extremely solid and rust free with the exception of a very small spot of rust in front of the right rear fender and behind the drivers front fender (close up pictures in gallery) Original interior in great shape for its age, the blue has some fading in front. The original floor mats are intact except for the passenger rear which has gone missing. All gauges, wipers, lights, and radio work great. Runs very well and drives out nice. Shifts easily and the brakes feel great. Look Close at all the pictures, there are so many little tags, stamps, and details that this Acapulco Thing retains because it is original with low miles. Restored ones lose all of those original details. Many people restore their regular \"Things\" to look like Acapulco Things so don't get fooled by a fake!

It has been meticulously cared for and has records dating back to its original purchase from a California dealer. The 250SL was the second version of the W 113 SL series and featured a number of improvements over the earlier version. It is also very collectible since of the 48,912 SLs made in that series (1963-1971) fewer than 5,200 were 250SLs. A Wonderful Example!

The chrome is in very good condition and nicely compliments the paint. The pagoda hard tops paint (same Ivory as body) is in very nice condition, as is the headliner. The convertible top is in good condition. The seat upholstery is red , contrasting nicely with the Ivory exterior and in very good condition. The carpeting is also red. The wood trim on the interior is in good condition as is the red dash covering. The instrument cluster and the rest of the interior looks very nice. The cars 2.5 liter fuel-injected engine starts and runs nicely. It has plenty of power to pull this car along briskly at modern highway speeds. The transmission is 4-speed manual.

Not only is this truck a short bed and a mainly original example of this generation of F series, but it is also representative of the time that it is from with its retro color scheme and its different memorabilia and gadgets.  It is difficult to find a truck like this in clean condition, which can be explained by the fact that this truck has been in storage for nearly 40 years. The truck is a real time capsule as it still sports its inspection sticker from 1984 as well as a city of Chicago and town stickers from the same year. Other vintage decals include NRA stickers on either side window and a hunting club the owner must have been a part of back in the early 1980s. These pieces of memorabilia pair well with its groovy Turtle Top color scheme and the fact that this truck still sports its original sheet metal.  Going along with the theme of originality, is that this truck still features its original powertrain. This F150 is powered by a 351 V8 engine that sends power to an automatic transmission making for a comfortable yet exciting driving experience. The truck rolls along on its original turbine style wheels that are wrapped around by BF Goodrich all-terrain tires. Another notable feature about the exterior of this truck is that it is the desired short bed configuration with the bed coated in Line-X for durability and is in great shape. Up front the truck wears a bull bar that is outfitted with a pair of fog lights.  Moving inside, this trucks original shag carpet interior pairs well with the Turtle Top exterior, which really completes this trucks nostalgic look and really makes you feel like you are back in the 70s when driving this vehicle around. Other cool features inside the truck are a Cobra CB radio, tilt wheel, and air conditioning. The headliner and carpeting are in great shape and the seats are overall in pretty good shape with some signs of wear and tear that is expected from an over 40-year-old vehicle.  Overall, if you are looking for a truck that will make you feel nostalgic as if you are back in the 70s then this is the truck for you. Its interior and exterior color schemes are representative of the era that it is from, and the truck sports most of its original components. To bring it all together this truck features different pieces of memorabilia that are exemplary of the time it is from including its inspection and club stickers as well as its CB radio. Classic vehicles of all sorts have the ability to bring us back to a simpler time and this vehicle is surely one that will do that for you.  $35,000"

Purchased by its current owner in 2007 who shortly thereafter embarked on an exhaustive nut/bolt, frame-off, rotisserie restoration. It is beautifully re-finished in its original Caspain Blue (74) with a proper tan leather and cloth interior, tan cloth top & boot cover with just 4,000 miles since the odometer was reset after its complete restoration. It comes equipped with the 257ci Inline-Eight and a Hydra-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission and includes a large cache of records, books & manuals, and a clean California title.  The exterior was fully disassembled, the body removed from the frame along with doors, hood, and trunk, fully stripped, and painted to the highest standards in single-stage Caspain Blue on a rotisserie. The finish is smooth as glass including the body, jambs, and undercarriage and the alignments and fitment are outstanding. The chrome was replated, trim polished, lenses refreshed and all rubber replaced. The new top was reinstalled onto a fully restored frame and fits beautifully. The 15\" steel rims were finished in classic red and wear correct trim rings and hubcaps and are wrapped in 7.00-15 Firestone Deluxe Champion whitewall tires. Even the frame and undercarriage components have been professionally powder-coated. The car maintains a stunning appearance and looks nearly new. The interior is immaculate with new two-tone leather & cloth seating, door panels, cards, and matching rugs with tan piping. It has a lovely refinished woodgrain dashboard, a working AM radio along with fully operational lighting, the proper 6-volt system with new wiring, a working clock and wipers, rebuilt power top, and all working gauges (with the exception of the fuel gauge). It is a very comfortable example even for the longest drives. 257ci Inline-Eight was fully rebuilt, it starts easily, runs cool, and idles quietly and smoothly. The rebuilt Hydra-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission shifts at all of the proper shift points and the restored braking and suspension work as designed. New bushings, mounts, and suspension all make for a factory-new driving experience for this exquisitely restored classic Oldsmobile. This is a great opportunity to own a truly investment-grade vintage Oldsmobile, a classic piece of American history that is ready for its next 76 years!

Under the hood was a 4.4 L Tipo F 101 AC 000 Colombo V12 engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission that put out 335 hp. Rather than a transaxle setup like the Daytona, the 5-speed transmission was bolted directly to the engine, giving the 365 GTC/4 a near-perfect 51:49 weight distribution. US export models received three-point seat belts, side markers, and numerous engine modifications to comply with Federal emission standards, including air injection, a carbon, and a different exhaust system which lowered the engine output to 316 hp. Only 505 examples were built over the cars two-year production span. Today, the GTC/4 stands as the more elegant and manageable younger sibling of the infamous Daytona. With a dramatically more street-worthy nature, the GTC/4 has the looks of the much pricier Daytona while being far more pleasant and comfortable to use on a daily basis. Pricing on the GTC/4 has been very solid over the last 5 years while continually trending in a positive direction. Having driven both extensively, we feel that the GTC/4 is overall undervalued given the fantastic V12 experience it provides in addition to its timeless good looks, and we see ample room for increased future value. This particular example, 101AC101147745, was delivered in 1971 to its initial owner in Crepaldi, Italy, finished in metallic blue with a tan leather interior. It was later transported to the US, where it was offered for sale by Ferrari of Los Gatos in Los Gatos, CA, in 1978 and again in 1988 with a reported 18,875 miles on the odometer. The car was then purchased by a new owner out of New York and repainted black, and later that same year, it was yet again offered for sale by Berlinetta Motorcars in Huntington Station, NY. Two years later, in 1990, the Ferrari was offered for sale by Tim Stanford Foreign Cars out of Fort Lauderdale, FL, with a reported 19,500 miles on the odometer. It remained in Florida for the next three years, where it was offered for sale by the same owner in 1991, 1992, and 1993 before it eventually exchanged hands in 1993 with 19,847 miles on the odometer. Following a six-year ownership in Miami, FL, this GTC/4 was offered for sale in 1999 to a fellow Floridian who owned the car for the next seven years. It made its way to Motorcar Gallery in Fort Lauderdale, FL, on July 2006 and was reportedly freshly serviced before being listed. It was purchased in August by its next owner out of Mars, PA, who continued owning the car for the next five years. The Ferrari made its rounds on eBay in late 2011 and early 2012. It was described as having undergone a bare metal Rosso Cordoba respray with a new Interior, re-chromed trim, engine detail, freshened camshaft by Web Cam Inc, rebuilt carburetors, starter, alternator, AC system, and brake booster. Sometime in mid to late 2012, it was purchased by its next owner out of Charlotte, NC, which is when the service records on file begin. Throughout this ownership, the car was mostly serviced at Automotive International of Charlotte, NC. In August of 2012, it received a brake system flush, cleaned wiper assembly, as well as some minor interior electrical repairs. It returned in October of the same year for further minor services that included an inoperative heat fan and a broken fuel enrichment system. A new window switch and lighter plug were installed along with new headlamps in August of 2013 by the same shop. A new ignition coil was installed in June 2014 to correct an intermittent ignition issue, and new engine mounts were also installed. The passenger wiper was repaired in March of 2015 due to a broken wiper arm post shaft, the voltage regulator was rebuilt, and the rear right wheel bearing was replaced. In May of 2015, new ignition boxes were installed along with the corresponding wiring and ignition coils. A couple of small holes in an exhaust were repaired as well. The car would exchange hands again in 2018, where it ended up with its current owner and consignor, who is a good friend and enthusiast. Being very knowledgeable about the workings of cars, he completed a number of maintenance items on his own, which included having the brake booster and master cylinder rebuilt, replacing the spark plug wires with factory-correct ones, replacing the fuel and vacuum hoses, balancing and tuning the carbs, and replacing the fluids and oil in 2020 then again in 2022 As it sits, this is a well-sorted and very correct example of one of Ferraris most underrated V12 grand touring machines. High-speed and long-distance driving are what this car was built for, and its lengthy service history will allow its future owner to enjoy it to its full potential. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the original toolkit, owners manual, and all service and history records on file. In addition, we are working on getting a Massini report for the car, which will be uploaded to the listing and included in the sale as well.

A solid rust free Phoenix Arizona car all its life until it moved a few hours south to Tucson Az about 2 years ago. This Impala retains all of its original body panels and was accident free with original paint still on the car before its comprehensive restoration started in 2005. The car was stripped to bare metal and put on a rotisserie for repaint to show quality standard in its original color of Honduras Maroon. Extra care was taken to clean the car before stripping to uncover factory stencil and paint markings so that they could be replicated after paint. All gaps are extremely good and body panels are straight, paint is fully sanded and buffed. The undercarriage has the correct oxide sealer finish and the trunk is spatter painted as original.  The interior was restored in the cars correct Fawn color with factory correct materials throughout. All gauges were rebuilt or replaced and all function properly. The factory original Sun Tach is mounted on the column. The AM radio works as do the wipers, blinkers, etc. This is a very well sorted car.  The original 409 engine was fully balanced and rebuilt with forged TRW 11.1 pistons and upgraded stainless valves. In 2017 the next owner after restoration upgraded the cam to a Comp Cams 48-000-5 and added roller rockers, HD springs, and titanium locks and retainers to strengthen the top end. Bob Ream rebuilt the Date code correct original Carburetors in 2018. This car runs Flawlessly, starts right up cold and idles immediately dropping RPMs as it comes off the choke just like it did when new. Sounds tame through the factory NOS exhaust system with mufflers and resonators but dont be fooled this 409 burns rubber all through first when floored and rips right up to 6000 RPM QUICK! The factory Correct Borg Warner aluminum T-10 4 speed was rebuilt and shifts perfectly. Out back the original 3.08 Posi Traction rear differential was rebuilt as well. The car has correct NOS spiral shocks that are dated for the car but the fronts have been replaced with Bilsteins for ride improvement. Original NOS front shocks accompany the car as does the Original Cam, rocker arms, etc. The pictures show Additional parts included as well as Date code and part # list of all major mechanical parts on this car.  You would be hard Pressed to find a nicer example at any price. In 2011 the car was awarded at the VCCA national event in Flint Michigan. No awards accompany the car as they were retained by the restorer. The car comes with a stack of receipts, restoration photos, assembly manual, its original keys, and other documents.

        "text": "Harley-Davidson FLH 1977 $8,900  Harley-Davidson released the Shovelhead with the 1966 Electra Glide. It boasted an aluminum head with a different shaped combustion chamber and rocker arms attached to the rocker cover instead of to the head itself. The Electra Glide was a serious long distance tourer with a top speed just under 100 mph. A front disc brake was a welcome addition in 1972 and even at a hefty 738lbs the quarter mile time was a decent 15.42 seconds. The first Classic FLH appeared in 1977. This particular example has 20,474 original miles and has been completely gone through within the last 4 years and 4,000 miles. The engine was completely rebuilt during which time it was bored .030 over. During the same time it received all new lines and cables. It was repainted in a gorgeous Metallic Green about 10 years ago and it still shows great. Within the last 2 years it received new spoked wheels with wide whitewalls, new chrome 12 bars, new brake calipers and rotors, new fork seals, new bearings and a variety of new chrome covers. It is fed via an S&S carb and it sounds incredible ripping through its newer performance exhaust. It has been serviced every 1,000 miles since being rebuilt and everything is working as it should. In the last 4 years close to $15k has been spent on rebuilding and reconditioning this beauty yet we are barely asking half of that. It is priced fairly so if you like this bike reach out before someone else beats you to it!  $8,900"

This California bus has a rebuilt engine and is in good working order. The stock replacement engine was rebuilt a few years ago at Joels Harmon Garage, VW specialists in Cotati. It starts and runs smoothly with excellent oil pressure and plenty of power. Shifting is smooth though the gears and the suspension and braking feel good. The exterior is complete, the body has been primed over its original paint, is mostly straight, and should be a fairly easy restoration. The floors are solid except for some minor degradation in the driver's foot-well area. The pop-top goes up and down and the tent is usable as-is. The windows open and shut fine and the screens (not shown) are included. Inside is mostly complete though showing its age. The windows roll up and down easily, and the heater is in working order along with the wipers, horn, and exterior lighting though the speedometer and RMP gauges have stopped working. We are taking a look at that and should be able to address it. This is an honest, nice-driving California bus that could be enjoyed as-is or driven while restoring.

Originally built for World War II, the Jeep has always been built with ruggedness in mind to go over any terrain. Over the decades there have been many generations, but the overall boxy look has mainly stayed the same. This rings true for the Civilian Jeeps or more commonly known as CJs. The CJ-7 was produced from 1976-1986, and it is a good mix between the iconic Jeep look and the overall rounded and curvy design of many cars from the 70s. This 1984 example is representative of that design and is in beautiful stock condition. Hailing from out west, this vehicle has spent most of its life out in California and Nevada, which can help explain why this vehicle is so clean. Along with that, this vehicle has been comprehensively restored. Finished in a beautiful blue this color pairs well with the Laredo decals that run along the body of the vehicle. This Jeep also comes with a removable black hardtop that has also been refinished. This CJ is powered by a fuel injected 4.2L inline 6-cylinder engine that drives power to a 5-speed manual Borg-Warner T5 transmission. The vehicle sits at stock ride height and wears factory CJ-7 wheels that are wrapped around by 31 Toyo Open Country all-terrain tires. A matching spare wheel and tire sits on the tailgate. This vehicles stock condition makes it easy to drive and the fuel injected engine paired with 5-speed manual transmission gives you a simple and reliable yet fun driving experience. Moving to the interior, one will see a pair of front bucket seats separated by a locking center console. Sitting in front of the gear and transfer case shifter are a few different gauges. On the floor are a pair of Bestop floor mats, and out back is a nice bench seat for two. This simple interior is commonplace among Jeeps from this era. This vehicle is perfect for someone who is looking to buy a stock Jeep CJ in excellent condition. Its beautiful blue exterior pairs well with the Laredo badging that fit the body lines of this CJ well, and its stock condition makes this Jeep fun and simple to drive. For more pictures and information please give us a call at 508-775-3276 or email us at   $35,000"

A bright shade of green covers the exterior, and it is contrasted with beige leather upholstery and black carpets. The car is equipped with Zenith carburetors, head restraints, a collapsable Targa roof panel, fog lamps, and a new AC system from Straat. This well-documented vehicle has been under the same ownership since 2016 and received a restoration in 2021. The car's five-digit odometer reads 69,743 miles, but the total mileage is unknown. It is located in Miami, Florida. The recent restoration of the interior and re-paint of the exterior of this 911 show well in the third-party photographs and inspection. The car's green paint is in excellent condition after a glass out respray of the original color. The car retains its original sheet metal. The re-trimmed interior carpets and upholstery are without blemish, and the dash is without cracks. The new AC system is reported to work as designed, and the sound system functions as it should. Mechanically, the car is sound, thanks to a mechanical restoration by Klub Sport Racing in 2016. Recent receipts show service to the shifter and carburetors to ensure the car is running as intended. Included in the sale of the vehicle is a detailed log of repairs, oil changes, fuel refills, and tire purchases from the original owner dating from 1971-1986. Additional information about, and receipts from the recent restoration performed by Carparc in California are also included. The tool kit, jack, owner's manual, and spare tire are also still with the car. This Porsche 911 is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Miami, FL. About the model The Targa version of the 1971 Porsche 911T 2.2 Liter was introduced in 1970. These semi-convertible sports cars were powered by a 2.2L naturally aspirated flat-six engine that sent 125hp to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual or 4-speed semi-automatic transmission. In production until 1971, the Porsche 911T 2.2 Liter Targa was replaced by the Porsche 911T 2.4 Liter.

This is not just because of its good looks. Before that, you had two beautiful convertibles: the 190SL and the 300SL Gullwing. The result is a beautiful design without any fuss. The roof was given a safe roll-proof construction that rose at the sides. With this design, it was somewhat akin to an Oriental building; a Pagoda. Voila, a spitz name was born for this beautiful SL, and later became a legend. Design and engineering came together in a cruiser that screamed to cruise around elegantly in a timeless classic. You know us a bit by now, and know that we are always looking for something nice, something extra. Ours is an original American-made manual transmission Mercedes 250 SL. This one has been neatly restored and fully documented, just the way you want it! We ourselves are still amazed at how modern this Sixties-Lovely drives.

        "text": "Chevrolet Corvette 1969 $89,950  1969 Corvette L71 427/435 Yellow Yenko Delivery For 1969 Cheverlot refined the new C3 1968 model with changes that increased horsepower as well as fixing small things that were irritating to customers. One important update was the ladder-type, steel-reinforced frame was stiffened in an effort to reduce body shake and vibration. A second was a production tooling change that opened up the inner door panels a half-inch per side, allowing occupants additional shoulder space.  The base engine became the 300 horsepower 350 cubic inch V-8.  Near the top of the optional engine list was the L71 427. A $290.40 upgrade that got you 435 horsepower with triple holley carburetors. The only higher up the chain a buyer could go was the L88/L89 engines intended for racing. Most people associate the name Yenko with the 427 Camaro/SCs, 427 Chevelle/SCs, and 427 Nova/SCs, but the Canonsburg, Pennsylvania's Yenko Chevrolet was very proud to be the Greater Pittsburgh area's only \"authorized\" High Performance Corvette dealer back in the late 60s. Throughout the 1960s, Don and Frank Yenko routinely ran ads in the Pittsburgh Press proudly announcing \"Buy Your Corvette at Yenko Corvette Center,\" and they sold a lot of performance Corvettes. This very special car was one of those. A copy of the tank sticker on file verifies other important details about this car. Built in March 1969, this highly original Daytona Yellow 1969 Corvette is one of 2,722 produced with the L71 427/435 HP Tri-Power engine, in this case mated to a 4-speed manual transmission and optional 4.11:1 gearing to draw full peak horsepower from the big-block V-8. At just more than 40,000 original miles, it retains most of its original Daytona Yellow paint and the original black interior complete with tilt-telescopic steering column, tinted glass and Delco AM/FM radio. Proudly displaying Yenko badges on the hood and tail panel, it retains its transistor ignition, chrome luggage rack, bright fender louver trim and Rally wheels with Whitewall tires. A very original car with lots of unique details. For example, the correct Tri-Power Smog Pump which was an exclusive to the Tri-Power cars. Original clear tape on the headlight wiring loom-the vacuum headlights and parking lights all function like new-having the correct black paint \"cut line\" in the engine compartment at the firewall tip of each fender. Also the original NOS F70x15-inch Firestone white striped bias ply tires, 15x8-inch Rally wheels, four-clip beauty rings and correct hubcaps all point to this car being totally original. Historically, this Corvette L71 has \"been seen around\" the Greater Pittsburgh area for most of its fifty years. In 1981 it was owned by Harry Statowitz in indianola. By the early 2000s it was in the hands of Larry Tenorovich. In 2006 it was purchased by a New Florence, Pennsylvania, Corvette collector named Bob Priest. Priest had performed a basic engine rebuild on the original date code (\"LT\") 427 big-block, 4.251-inch bore and 3.76-inch stroke, and cast-iron square-port \"L71\" big-block cylinder heads, using the original stock GM components.  In late 2007 Brian Henderson bought the car. A Pennsylvania native, Brian is co-owner of one of the most successful muscle car restoration shops in the country, Latrobe, Pennsylvania's Super Car Workshop. The car was purchased by the current owner in 2016. The car has recently been sorted and its triple Holley 2 barrels have been rebuilt and tuned. It represents a very rare opportunity to purchase a documented Yenko delivered L71 427/435 Corvette in outstanding original condition.  $89,950"

This pony car is painted in the factory-correct Prairie Bronze and complemented by the Palomino beige vinyl interior. Additional factory features include a set of Rally Pac gauges, convertible top, power brakes, 3.00:1 rear-end gears, A/C, and a period-correct radio. This early 1965 Mustang still uses the original style generator and appears to have early-style body panels unique to this era. The original speedometer, glove box door, air cleaner, and valve cover have all been swapped out in favor of newer parts to improve functionality. The odometer reads 70,608 miles, but the true mileage is unknown. This Mustang is located in California. The third-party photos and inspection show a well-cared-for Mustang. The gold-colored exterior is in good condition, with minor chips, and the interior shows only minor wear to the dash, inner door panels, and the headliner. The car is said to be in good operating condition, including a new convertible top window. Included in the sale is a full-size spare and one set of keys.  This Mustang is being sold through a CLASSIC.COM Pro and is located in Newbury Park, CA.  About the model The first generation Ford Mustang was built in one of three body styles; hardtop (notchback), fastback, or convertible. The Ford Mustang was first launched as an unofficial 1964-1/2 model. These \"1964-1/2\" Mustangs were available with an inline six, a 260 cubic inch V8, or the 289 cubic inch V8. Upon the 1965 Mustang's official introduction, new engines became available. Depending on the engine used, these cars were available with a 3-speed manual, a 4-speed manual, or a 3-speed automatic transmission, all of which sent drive to the rear wheels. For the 1967 model year, Ford updated the Mustang, which resulted in the 1967-1968 First Generation Ford Mustang.

        "text": "Ford Thunderbird 1957 $85,000  For the 1955 model year, Ford introduced its answer to Chevrolet's Corvette, the Thunderbird, or the \"T-Bird\" as it has become known as today. Featuring an all metal body and V-8 engine, unlike Chevrolets 6 cylinder fiberglass Corvette, the T-Bird was built for sporty good looks, but also for comfort. For the 1957 model year, Thunderbird sales increased dramatically with an all new cosmetic design and performance options. Featuring an extended tail end by 6 inches, a new grille and bumpers, the 1957 T-Bird is considered by many to be the most beautiful of all the two seat Thunderbirds. Mechanically, you were able to upgrade the performance by ordering either the E-Code or F-Code engines. The E-Code is an incredible and very rare option increasing the horsepower by a lot. The E-Code features dual four barrel Holley carburetors, increased bore and stroke, higher compression ratio and automatic choke giving the 312 cubic inch Ford Y-Block V-8 enough horsepower to beat Chevrolets fuel injected 283 V-8 by just 2 horsepower. Furthermore buyers were also able to order the performance engines with the optional 3 speed manual transmission and even further overdrive was available for an additional cost. A true performance sports car, the E-Code is one of the coolest 1950's American sports cars ever made. Offered here is one of the finest and rarest examples of an original 1957 Ford Thunderbird \"E-Code\" that exists today. Owned by a gentleman here in Connecticut for many many years, this E-Bird has been cherished and very well taken care of. Besides being a true E-Code with the high performance \"dual quad\" engine, this E-Code is equipped with its original factory 3 speed manual transmission with factory overdrive! This is a true unicorn among Thunderbirds. On top of being such a rare bird, the restoration is wonderful having had a body off restoration some years ago with all the right details down to the firewall stampings and proper radiator hoses. Currently the car wears period chrome wire wheels and original skirts, but it also comes with its factory original steel wheels and \"dog dish\" hubcaps found only on true performance Birds. Mechanically it runs and drives incredibly well and is ready for the open road or car shows this coming spring. Contact us today for more information.  $85,000"

Introduced in 1954 at Earls Court Motor show, the XK140 incorporated a number of changes and improvements to the earlier model.Most significantly was increased legroom and higher standard horsepower at 190, with 210 available with fitment of the optional C-Type racing head. There were three different versions of the XK140. Standard cars with the 190 HP engine, single exhaust systems, disc wheels, and rear wheel covers.Next came the Special Equipment or SE modelswith the same engine, but with full dual exhaust system and knock off wire wheels. Also included were twin fog lamps and windshield washers. In the United States, this version was known as the 140M. Finally, the highest-specification SE model equipped with the C-Type head which became known as the XK140MC, as distinguished by an S prefix in their chassis numbers. Further, those cars equipped with the optional C-Type head were fitted with a plaque mounted on the passenger side dash, proclaiming that car as a replica of the car that had achieved 141 MPH at Le Mans. In a short production window of slightly more than 2 years a total of 8,936 chassis were built in all performance variations, and made available with three different body styles. First was the DHC (drophead coupe) with roll-up windows and jump seats; next was the FHC (Fixed Head Coupe); and last was the OTS (Open Two Seat Roadster), such as the car offered here, which had no exterior door handles or windows. Open Two Seat Roadster bodies were mounted on approximately 30% of the chassis. The car presented here is the most desirable version of the XK140. As verified by its JDHT Heritage Certificate it is a true XK140MC OTS Roadster, the highest-specification offered with the more desirable and sporting coachwork. Originally delivered through Max Hoffman of New York in February 1955. It is offered from a 51-year ownership, having been purchased in July 1972 from Richard Willard of Leominster Massachusetts by the current owners husband as a Mothers Day gift. The car was driven regularly as a summer car through the 70s, 80 and 90s, and in 2010 the owner made the decision to change the factory colors of black with red interior to the current blue on blue which displays quite well. Currently fitted with a replacement engine A62778 with C Type head G2934-8S. However, most importantly the original, rebuildable C head is included in the sale of the car. It is fitted with its original identification plate and body number tag. Also installed on the car are chrome XKE wheels which were an aesthetic decision by the current owner; the original XK140 painted spoke wheels are also included in the sale. Recent sorting includes a tune up, brake job, fluid change and over 400 miles of driving. This car additionally comes with a soft top, tonneau cover, side curtains, owners manual, shop manuals, and a complete set of documentation including the aforementioned Heritage Certificate as well as invoices spanning over 50 years of ownership.  $85,000"

Excellent drive train, 150-155 psi compression in every cylinder, 65-70 psi oil pressure when warm, no smoke cold or hot, quiet valves, excellent clutch operation, strong synchromesh, and no clunks in the rear end. We can see a lot of recent service work done...new alternator and fuel pump, new windshield rubber seals and compression strip, new brake calipers, pads and shoes, new brake flex lines, some new metal lines, and a new battery and coil. Top is very good, tonneau appears to be new, carpets and dash are all in very good condition as are interior panels and seats. Wiring looks like it has never been cut into, radiator fins are excellent as is the original cardboard radiator shroud. All signs of a properly serviced, cared for classic sports car. As for the rest....lots of smooth power and torque from the 2.5 liter six cylinder engine, power assist disc brakes, the IRS offers a better ride than most other period sports cars, roomy, comfortable, ample trunk space (spare wheel is in its own compartment under the trunk floor,), and even has its original (working) AM-FM radio. Amazing, ORIGINAL radio! Large diameter wheels/tires and high gearing offer comfortable highway cruising and these cars are perfect for either around town, country roads, or long distance touring. Reliable, easy to service and maintain, parts are widely available and easily accessed, and if you like the style of TRs, you will certainly enjoy this fifty two year old classic British sports car. And if you desire a racing style, we can install Minilite style alloy wheels and if you prefer a more traditional look, converting to wire wheels is easy.  $14,900"

The inner structure of the tub was reinforced, new impact bumpers with shock absorbers were integrated front and rear for a smooth appearance, a new short-hood look was introduced, and the doors received new internal bracing to improve side-impact resistance. The revised front trunk space now contained a single battery and a collapsible spare tire nestled over its 21-gallon fuel tank. The magnificent 1974 Porsche 911 Carrera 2.7 coupe featured here is finished in highly desirable Black with rare Gold graphics over Black. This exquisite motorcar is been meticulously maintained and is among one of the finest examples we have offered in years. This 911 still retains its original engine and transmission, which, in combination with its factory color combination, makes this the perfect example to add to any premier collection. I personally believe the investment potential of this rare limited production Carrera will grow beyond your imagination offered to the most demanding collector, investor, or enthusiast who aspires to own one of the very best!  $139,900"

Regarding the Jaguar XK150, the successor to both the XK120 and the XK140, the type name referred to the car's top speed in miles per hour. Although the XK150 fell just short of that speed, at the time it was one of the fastest production cars in the world at an impressive 135 miles per hour. Despite this minor disappointment, these cars remain absolutely stunning! The XK150 is distinguished from its predecessors by the curved windscreen, which is now a single piece instead of a split window. In addition, the grille in the nose is slightly wider and the windscreen has been moved back slightly, giving the nose an even more imposing look. Our XK150 underwent a thorough restoration in 2002, so the car is currently in excellent condition. The beige interior evokes associations with the seats in the back rooms of Windsor Castle, and in harmony with the deep dark blue exterior, this example really makes a statement on the road. Owning a classic car like the Jaguar XK150 is a source of pride and joy for enthusiasts who appreciate the craftsmanship and attention to detail behind its creation. Whether you are looking for a solid investment or just want to experience the excitement of driving a true classic, the Jaguar XK150 undoubtedly deserves your attention. What makes our example special? Apart from its aesthetic features, this XK150 has also undergone a technical metamorphosis during its restoration. Besides a complete engine overhaul, this British beauty boasts a BMW gearbox, which only further enhances the driving pleasure. In short, an ultimate gentleman sports car ready for many enjoyable miles!  $129,500 (OBO)"

        "text": "BMW 2800CS 1971 $85,000 (OBO)  - Chassis # 2204412 The BMW 2800 CS was the first in a series of coupes produced from 1968 to 1975, internally known as the BMW E9. The Karmann-designed 2800 CS replaced the 2000 C and CS and used a new straight-six engine dubbed the M30. The larger engine required both the wheelbase and the overall length of the car to be increased, yet the car was still lighter and more agile than the series it was replacing, weighing in at 1,420 kg (3,131 lb). The 2.8 L engine put out 168 hp through a 4-speed manual transmission. Only 276 examples of the 2800 CS were produced in 1971 out of a total of 6,283 produced over four years before the E9 range was replaced by the E24 6 Series. As a follow-up to the BMW New Class line, the 2800 CS continued the automakers pursuit of creating sporty automobiles while retaining the luxurious feel they had come to be known for. Many of the design cues used on the 2800 CS, like the longer nose and straight-six engine, would become staples of BMW and give the car both a timeless look and modern usability in todays traffic environment. Today, the 2800CS remains highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike. Thanks to their low production numbers, timeless good looks, and a high degree of useability, they have garnered a fantastic following in the collector car community. Pricing over the past 5 years has been steady with a general upward trend. We see these cars as solid investments, not very likely to pop in value but also highly unlikely to lose any value as well. They present a fantastic opportunity to purchase and use the car as intended while retaining the money invested. As is the case with any collector car, finding an example with great history and non-traditional colors is always the safest bet. This particular example, Chassis # 2204412, is an extremely original example that was owned and lovingly preserved by the same family for over 50 years. In that time, it has retained its original engine, much of its original paint, and all of its matching interior. It shows incredible indicators of originality, including factory stickers, inspection markings, and clamps. It was purchased new by Mr. Falk from Autos-Import S.A. of Geneva, Switzerland, in 1971 with a Sahara paint job and a tan woolen interior with corduroy cloth inserts. Original equipment includes power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, a rear-window defroster, and a Blaupunkt radio. The original owner passed away a short two years after purchasing the car, upon which it was passed down to his son. The son continued to own and meticulously maintain the car throughout the years, often at the same dealer it was purchased from. In 1996, the BMW was imported stateside through American Lamprecht, Inc. in Lawrence, NY, and was appraised in July of that same year by a company in Rowayton, CT, with just 41,466 kilometers (25,765 miles) on the odometer. In 2001 and 2007, it was entered in the Greenwich Concours dElegance and won best in class in the 2001 show. The meticulous service records continued, with the front brake calipers having been rebuilt in 2012 at La Jolla Independent BMW Service of La Jolla, CA. After 48 years of ownership, the son listed the BMW for sale on Bring a Trailer, where it was purchased by our client and current consignor. Services under its new owner began in 2021 with a new tailpipe installed at European Auto Center Repair in Norwalk, CT. In May of 2021, the car underwent a major service at Sports Car Restoration in Plainville, CT, that would last through October of that same year and total almost $20,000. During that time, it received new ignition wires, a new distributor cap, a new rotor, new fuel and coolant hoses, new carburetor chokes, a valve cover gasket, a rebuilt speedometer, odometer, and turn signals, some electric window repairs, and a replacement transmission. The transmission was replaced due to excessive grinding in the original gearbox. A used ZF S5-16 Four-Speed gearbox, in great condition, was sourced and installed, and the original was kept and will be included with the sale of the vehicle. The exterior, interior, underbody, and engine bay were also thoroughly cleaned and degreased during the service and areas at risk of rust were coated in a preventative wax coating. In November of 2022, the car visited Rennsport Automotive in Bedford Hills, NY, for new fluids as well as new spark plugs, distributor points, condenser, cap, and rotor. The valve cover gasket was also replaced alongside new V belts and a power steering filter. As it sits, following the numerous services it underwent in the past two years, this BMW 2800 CS is now a turnkey time-capsule example ready to take on anything from twisty roads to more concour shows. With largely original paint, an incredible original interior, all of the original equipment and accessories, and just ~30,000 original miles on the odometer, this rare German saloon with only one family ownership for 50 years is the pinnacle of automotive preservation. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the original purchase agreement, all of the importation documents and service records going back to new, manufacturers literature, 1970s first aid kit and roadside assistance kit, tools, spare parts, and upholstery fabric, a GPS unit, a radar detector, and a BMW car cover.

After the 300 SL was introduced, an American Mercedes importer noticed that many people were interested, but that the 300 SL was too expensive for what most wanted to spend on a weekend car. After a phone call with Germany, everything accelerated; later that year the 190 SL (based on the Ponton) appeared at the New York show. A year later, the production version was ready in Geneva. Remarkably, not as a sports car, but as a comfortable two-seater. This became a great success, from 1955 to 1963 more than 25.000 cars were produced in Germany. Our 190 SL is from 1961, when smoking and ivory were still very normal, and was brought to the Netherlands in 1994. There the car remained in the family until 2019, after which it went to a Dutch collector. This collector decided to thin out his collection and now we were able to add the 190 to ours. The 190 SL is in good condition, and it even participated in the historic Zolder Grand Prix twice. Not for racing, fortunately, because it was never meant for that, but for strolling. If you want to enjoy yourself comfortably in the direction of Italy or just along the beach in the Netherlands without having to participate in every traffic light race, then this is the car for you! You dont have to prove anything with this car because, 190 SL. Pure class. Any way you look at it  Mercedes 190 SL  $120,000 (OBO)"

        "text": "Shelby Cobra 1965 $750,000  History of the DRAGONSNAKE program: During the first half of the 1960s, the Cobra achieved motorsport success all over the world. It dominated USRRC and SCCA circuit racing, and was an increasingly persistent thorn in Ferraris side in international competition. In 1965, it finally broke the Italian marques stranglehold over GT racing by winning the International Championship for GT Manufacturers. With the fearsome acceleration offered by a powerful V8 in a compact chassis, it was even well suited to drag racing. In 1963, a small band of employees persuaded Carroll Shelby to sanction the development of a drag-racing package. Among other upgrades, four stages of tune were offered for the 289ci engine, producing anything from 270hp to 380hp. The famous Dragonsnake was born. Only five factory 289ci Dragonsnakes were built, but other CSX Shelby Cobras were converted to Dragonsnake spec by independent privateers who could buy the package from Shelby when new. The Cobra made to dominate the drag strip did just that in the 1960s  The goods: The story goes that after a few employees at Carroll Shelby's small car company created a drag-strip-focused version of the Cobra on their own time, Shelby approved a tiny production run of this quarter-miler called the Dragonsnake. Not legal to drive on the street, they could be ordered from the factory or customers could have their Cobras fitted with Dragonsnake components like a chrome roll bar, new tachometer, revised rear fender flares to fit fat drag slicks on American Racing wheels, and sliding side windows. Only five left the the factory, four fitted with the 289-cubic-inch V8, one got the 427-ci monster. The concept car featured here (CSX 2800) is dedicated to drag racer and NHRA champion Bruce Larson, a man the organizing body calls \"NHRA's original triple-threat Pro driver.\" In 1963, Larson drove Jim Costilow's 289 Dragonsnake to class honors at the Winternationals, Springnationals, and Indy U.S. Nationals, setting records throughout the year in the process. Larson took the Nationals again in 1964. Because Larson was working at a Chevrolet dealership when he did this, the dealership owner had Larson in a Chevy by 1966. But the Cobra had proved itself a winning race car in yet another discipline, and would keep claiming trophies into the late sixties. The remaining three continuation Dragonsnakes that we are now offering for sale will start as an aluminum slab-side roadster in the CSX2000 series, meaning based on the original 289-ci chassis. The tube rails are four-inch round units, the engine is a 364-ci V8 with an aluminum block and eight Weber carbs making 500 horsepower, fed by a 14-gallon gas tank and Holley electric fuel pump. It's shifted through a Tremec five-speed manual to spur a car weighing roughly 2,100 pounds. Inside, an 8,000-rpm tach mixes with black leather seats, leather door pulls, a rearview mirror, glove box, custom shift knob, and stainless steel roll bar. Other kit includes an aluminum radiator and electric fan, rack and pinion steering, adjustable Penske shocks, 1963-style disc brakes, a custom exhaust, polished side vents and chrome bumpers, and vintage Cobra badges. The car sits on 15-inch vintage FIA wheels wearing Mickey Thompson tires sized 29 x 4.5 in front, 28 x 10.5 in back. Each Dragonsnake costs $750,000 before options. These Dragon Snakes are authenticated by Shelby and built under their guidance with CSX # 's reserved in the SAAC registry for each build.  $750,000"

If you are looking for a quality first-generation Mustang, this beautiful specimen might be your car. This restored 1965 C-code coupe captures all the excitement from almost 60 years ago when the Mustang forever changed the automotive landscape. It epitomizes the classic Mustang look with its timeless lines and Poppy Red paint, and offers a sporty ride with its V8 engine and modest proportions.  Built in August 1964, this particular Mustang represents the first month of production for the revised 1965 model. It was the subject of a thorough restoration and has more new parts than can possibly be listed here. The floors, frame sections, rockers, and torque boxes are all solid and free of rust problems. The body was repainted in its original Poppy Red and looks fantastic; is there a better color for a first generation Mustang? All the chrome and moldings were replaced or reconditioned, as were the lenses, emblems, and trim pieces. Note the 289 Hi-Po badges on the fenders. The classic 14 styled steel wheels wear double redline bias ply tires that look so perfect under this car. The factory C-code 2-barrel 289 was replaced with a rebuilt 4-barrel 302. It resembles a 1965 Hi-Po engine with its black paint, chrome valve covers, and open element air cleaner, but the practicality of a distributor vacuum advance canister keeps things real. You will have to look closer to see performance parts like the aluminum Edelbrock intake manifold that has been painted black, or the Holley 4160 carburetor. The balance of the drivetrain consists of a C4 automatic transmission and 8 rear end with 2.80 gears. The brakes, steering, and suspension are all in good operating condition as well. The car has a standard black interior that looks factory fresh. Seats, carpet, door panels, headliner, dash, instruments, switches, bezels, steering wheel, sunvisors; everything looks new. Same with the mirrors, door seals and window felts. The only change from stock is a digital AM/FM radio that fits in the original dash opening. Everything is functional as well including the the speedometer, fuel gauge, lights, turn signals, wipers, washers, horn, and heater/defroster. The trunk houses a full size spare, and check out the chrome plated scissors jack! This Mustang presents a very appealing package. It is a gorgeous car inside and out, in turn-key condition with a V8 engine. While this classic can be appreciated by anyone, just be prepared to draw attention from all types of people wherever you go.   $39,500"

        "text": "Ford F250 1966 $39,900  All vehicle trades considered including classics and performance. We can assist with financing and shipping as needed. Huge price reduction! Take a close look at this 1966 Ford F250. This southern truck has been through a comprehensive frame-off restoration. Of course that involved extensive exterior, interior, and mechanical work. But it also included a number of upgrades such as a Crown Victoria cradle swap, Gear Vendors overdrive, and a monster 545ci engine. It all comes together in a fabulous looking truck that has stump-pulling torque yet rides as comfortably as a new car. This is definitely not your average old pickup. To begin, this project started with an Arizona truck that was clean and dry throughout. It still retains all its original sheetmetal. After being stripped down and prepped, the body was professionally painted a brilliant silver from tip to tail. It was given the roll pan treatment in back along with new chrome, trim, and emblems throughout. Note the factory tool box on the right side of the bed. There are also aluminum Torque Thrust wheels that look absolutely perfect with the rest of the truck. This Ford was originally built with a Y-code 352ci engine. While theres nothing wrong with that, it wasnt going to make the cut for this project. Instead a new motor was built, that being a 460 Ford that was stroked to a mammoth 545 cubic inches. It was built for the street, so while there is prodigious torque and great power, it also starts and idles just fine and runs on pump gas. It has a very healthy sound through the 3 custom exhaust, but it is also equipped with electric cutouts if thats not enough for you. The transmission is a rebuilt Ford C6 that has been fitted with a Gear Vendors overdrive unit, making this pickup very highway friendly. The rear end is a limited slip Ford 9 with 3.50 gears. The engine cradle has been replaced with that from a late model Crown Victoria along with a bit of custom work. This gives a much improved front suspension along with an upgrade to power rack and pinion steering and power disc brakes. The rear suspension has been lowered as well. When everything is combined with the 129 wheelbase you end up with a surprisingly comfortable ride. It is nothing at all like you might expect from a 1966 pickup! The interior has been completely redone as well. The bench seat is from a late model F150 and includes a center armrest. It is a perfect fit and looks right at home, as does the custom headliner. The dash combines the original instrument cluster with a few aftermarket gauges along with controls for the overdrive, cutouts, and electric fans. The entire truck was rewired with a Painless harness for trouble-free operation. The headlights, turn signals, horn, wipers, and heater/defroster all function properly. The old 1966 factory radio is still present though it does not work. The collector truck market has a lot to offer, but this one still stands out. To be sure, it is a quality build with a great look and sound along with lots of nice parts. But what really stands out is how the finished product works so well. It offers a remarkable ride with much improved performance over stock along with great street manners. At least until you open those cutouts.   $39,900"

The 1964 Galaxie 500 R-Code was the most fearsome Ford of the early 1960s. With a 427ci dual 4-barrel engine rated at 425hp it delivered the most powerful engine of its day. Think about it; back then you could walk into a Ford dealer and essentially buy the same car that was cleaning up in NASCAR, albeit with a street version of the legendary 427. And while the Galaxie was a huge success with millions produced, only a few thousand R-codes were ever built, making them very rare today. This offering provides a unique opportunity to own one of these remarkable cars with its original, rebuilt engine. This Galaxie shows 40k miles and is the beneficiary of a recent refurbishment that included a 2016 trim-off repaint in its original Wimbledon White. It is a great color for the attractive 1964 styling with its fastback style roof and sleek, subdued trim. The sheetmetal all looks straight without any signs of past trauma, and the floors are original throughout. The original door tag is also present and shows a production date of 10-10-63 making it a fairly early build. All of the chrome and trim is in good condition right down to those meaningful 427 emblems on the fenders. The 15 steel wheels wear General tires from 2016. Note the Ford hub caps are included; we just thought it looked meaner without them. While the exterior of this Galaxie may draw its share of looks, the engine compartment is truly captivating. There sits the cars original dual quad 427ci R-code which was factory rated at 425 hp and 480 ft-lbs. While Ford did not VIN stamp engines until 1968, this one shows the correct C4AE 6015-A casting number and a proper 3K1 (10-1-63) casting date. The engine was fully rebuilt and has roughly 500 miles since completion. Note the engine block did not require an overbore or sleeves. The cylinder heads are the correct C3AE 6090-J castings and are mated to Fords impressive cast iron headers. The intake manifold, dual Holley carburetors, and air cleaner were all replaced though the original pieces are included. Same with the alternator. The transmission appears to be the original T10 4-speed based on date codes (like the engine, no VIN stamps were applied until years later). Note the T10 is correct for early 1964 Galaxies; later builds received the new-for-64 Toploader. The transmission was also rebuilt so it shifts properly and stays in gear. The 9 rear end is also believed original and came from the factory with 3.50 gears and an open differential. As an R-code, brakes and steering are manual which keeps things fast, light, and simple. All mechanical systems are in good operating condition with many new parts throughout. The code 75 red interior is mostly original and looks terrific for its age. There is a split bench seat in front and another bench seat in back that offers plenty of legroom. Note there are no seat belts. The carpet has been replaced and a new headliner was professionally installed. The dash is simple and straightforward with instruments limited to a speedometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge. An aftermarket oil pressure gauge has been installed along with a T-handle Hurst shifter. The headlights, dash lights, turn signals, backup lights, horn, wipers, courtesy lights, and parking brake all work properly. So do the heater / defroster and factory AM radio. The cavernous trunk contains what may be an original spare tire and bumper jack. This R-code is more than just a rare classic car. Its a piece of history from the birth of the horsepower wars, when win on Sunday, sell on Monday really meant something. This big Galaxie is also great fun to drive, offering an experience completely unlike anything today. These cars dont show up on the market very often, especially in this condition and with an original drivetrain. And while other 64 R-codes have sold well into six figures, this one presents as a relative bargain.   $87,500"

Only rust is behind the rear wheels on each side, very, very little in rocker panels and bottom of front fenders. The rest of the sheet metal is excellent including the floor and the trunk floor.

Boiled out fuel tank and all fuel lines cleaned. New battery. New complete interior and the seats were stripped down to the springs.

This stately and elegant Bentley has been restored by world renowned Bentley and Rolls Royce Restorer Richard Gorman @ Vantage Motorworks Miami. After the restoration, Mr. Gorman sold the car to Emir Nasser of Kuwait, who added it to his magnificent car collection. Prior to the Sheiks ownership, this very special Bentley was owned by famous actor Nicholas Cage as part of his storied collection. After the late Sheikhs ownership, Cooper Classics LTD acquired the car and had the restoration refreshed by Automotive Restorations in Stratford Connecticut in 2022. During the refreshening of the restoration, we installed 4 new BF Goodrich Silvertown Whitewall tires. The total mileage is 32,689 Miles. The car appears as new inside and out despite being an older restoration and is ready to be used and enjoyed. It fires right up and everything functions as it should. The Air Conditioning blows ice cold out of the rear compartment as it should. We feel this is likely one of the finest examples in existence, and the only Flying Spur S3 Continental available for purchase at the time of this writing. A similar example was once owned by Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones in less-rare Right Hand Drive spec and was famously known as Blue Lena, which sold for over $1 million at auction. This car comes with all of its tools, including its jack, manual, build sheet, and records.  Contact Seller"

The original numbers matching engine comes with the car, and can be rebuilt with all the Go Fast aftermarket options available. This was an air conditioned Cougar with lots of options. This Cougar would be worth at least $30,000 to $40,000 when fully restored. ..  BODY: This Cougar doesnt need a lot of rust / body repair. The frame is straight and the quarters are in decent condition. Overall not that much is needed to get this Cougar body ready to paint. INTERIOR:  The interior should be brought back to excellence. The good news is that you can see what is needed. You arent accepting someone elses mistakes or bad repairs. The instrument panel is in good condition, just dirty, but you will want a new dash pad. The High Back seats are worth some money all by themselves. The seats will need recovering, but new covers are available to make the job much less costly. The door panels are there, but you probably want new ones anyway. ENGINE BAY: The original 351 Cleveland engine could probably be started again, but should be rebuilt along with the carburetor and the distributor could be upgraded with a modern Petronixs kit.  The engine bay is in great condition, and just needs to be cleaned and painted.  MISC. The car is definitely a project but we can help where you need our help. We can sell you any of the items you may need, like new seat covers, new carpet Etc. Please ask any questions, we know someone will receive a great project and ultimately a great Classic Big Block Cougar. The Cougar is currently off the DMV System in California. We will supply you with the documents you will need to get the car licensed in your state.    $3,500 (OBO)"

Good restorable Mustang Convertibles are very hard to find. This Mustang can be restored into an awesome Classic. If you have ever wanted a 66 Mustang Convertible project that was affordable, this is the car.The interior and engine also look to be in good shape. Originally a six cylinder car, with a stick shift, you could keep the car as is, or easily upgrade the suspension to a 5 lug suspension both front and rear.We would recommend rebuilding the original engine that comes with the car, but you could also consider replacing it with a 289, 302, or even a 351 engine, and either a C-4 automatic or a T-5 manual transmission if you want to be able to spin the tires easily.Call us if you need a different engine and/or a transmission.All of the engine/transmission options are available separately at very reasonable prices. The car looks to be an original Blue convertible, but once you do the restoration, it can be repainted to any color of your choice. The original top was Black and, but it will need some restoration to have it functioning properly again. It comes equipped with its original manual transmission, so the clutch pedal is already in place if you decide to upgrade to a T-5 or better. This convertible was beautiful - see pictures of how it could look when fully restored. It brought buyers into the showrooms by the thousands and Fords strategy workedselling more Mustangs than ever before. When fully restored, this car will easily sell for $30,000 or more.   This car has a good exterior body shell, no accidents, and most all the panels are very straightand the quarters are in decent condition. If you have body repair skills, this is a great project. The frame of this Convertible is in fair condition and straight, but it will need new floor pans, rocker channels, torque boxes, and frame rail extensions.The front frame rails look to be in good condition, which makes it a relatively easy car to restore. Dynacorn now makes a jig welded bottom half for any Mustang convertible which makes restoring convertibles much easier than it used to be.The convertible top will need to be replaced, and the vinyl window should be changed.

A supercharged 1.8-liter inline-four was installed along with a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and the chassis has been fitted with a lowered suspension and four-wheel disc brakes with Wilwood front calipers. The body is finished in yellow and has a black soft top, a louvered hood, fender flares, and triple windshield wipers. Other equipment includes black leather upholstery, 15 alloy wheels, a roll bar, a Moto-Lita steering wheel, burl wood trim, DJ Safety harnesses, and a JVC stereo. This modified MGB is now offered on dealer consignment with build records and photos, magazine articles featuring the car, and a California title listing the vehicle as a 1967 MG coupe.  Drivetrain and chassis components from a rusted MGB GT were transferred to a donor roadster body during the aforementioned build, which was conducted under current ownership by On The Road Again Classics of Morgan Hill, California. The car was stripped to bare metal, exterior trim was removed, and Sebring-style front and rear valances, front brake-cooling ducts, and fender flares were added before a repaint in yellow. Additional details include a black soft top, a louvered hood, an enlarged mesh grille, front bumperettes, triple windshield wipers, black side mirrors, red-lens taillights, and a single exhaust outlet. Paint chips and blemishes around the car can be viewed in the photo gallery below.  Eight-spoke 15 alloy wheels are mounted with 205/50 Falken Azenis tires. The suspension has been lowered and modified with negative front camber, a 7/8 front sway bar, fast road springs, and heavy-duty lever-arm shocks. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with Wilwood four-piston front calipers plus vented rotors up front and Cobra units out back.  The cabin is upholstered in black leather with red piping and is accented with burl wood trim on the dash, center console, and door panels. A roll bar has been added along with a Moto-Lita steering wheel, a JVC AM/FM/cassette stereo, red DJ Safety four-point harnesses, and MG-branded rubber floor mats. The seats have headrests, and HVAC outlets are positioned to the left of the glovebox. The wood on the driver-door armrest is cracked. A battery cutoff switch is located in the trunk.  Smiths white-dial instrumentation consists of a 170-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges, while an Innovate Motorsports digital air/fuel mixture display has been added in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 10k miles, which is said to represent the distance added since completion of the build. Total chassis mileage is unknown.  The replacement 1.8-liter inline-four was reportedly overbored .040 and features a nitrided crankshaft, a lightened flywheel, a high-capacity oil sump, a custom camshaft, an aluminum cylinder head, Rimflo valves, roller rocker arms, hardened lifters, a finned valve cover, and Arias forged pistons with an 8.3:1 compression ratio. A supercharger has been added along with a PerTronix electronic ignition system, a cold-air intake, and a heavy-duty radiator with dual electric puller fans. The exhaust headers flow into a stainless-steel resonator, muffler, and finisher.  Power is sent to the rear wheels through a T9 five-speed manual transmission and an 8 Ford rear end with a limited-slip differential and 3.5:1 gearing.  Build photos and records are pictured in the gallery along with magazine articles featuring this vehicle.  The chassis plate shown above was installed by the current owner, and the numberGHD3L99429is consistent with an MGB GT produced in 1966. The VIN listed on the California title bears a 67 prefix, and that document describes the car as a 1967 MGB GT coupe.  Visit us at http://www.MohrImports.com for full photo and video collection.

We are proud to present the nicest 356SC Cabriolet that has come through our doors in a very long time. This car benefitted from an extensive, in depth $155K restoration performed by marque specialists Club Sport Racing in Florida, which is documented with each and every invoice for the process. The car was stripped to bare metal and repainted in its factory Red, and the interior was completely reupholstered with new correct materials. The interior presents as new and all the gauges work, including the clock. This is a matching numbers and colors car including both its Certificate of Authenticity and Kardex. This 356SC has perfect panel gaps, and the paint maintains a glass-like mirror finish all around. The black soft top is new and in excellent condition, with a matching black boot cover. The car benefits from a working, modern day radio. The car has driven less than 3500 miles since the restoration and was recently serviced in 2020 including a brake service and a carb tune up. This European spec 356SC starts up with ease and is a joy to drive, thanks to the matching numbers transmission and engine which were both rebuilt during the restoration in 2013-2016. The engine bay is highly detailed with all correct decals and stickers. The underside is so clean you could eat off of it, and the car has absolutely no rust anywhere. We recently re-acquired this 356SC after selling it to a fastidious 356 Collector owner after multiple years of ownership and care. This owner put about 2500 miles on the car, and had the original carburetors rebuilt by the famed 356 Carburetor Rescue, which recently announced the closing of their business. These rebuilt carburetors come in a box with the car, and the set currently installed on the car is in perfect tune. This 356SC is ready to be enjoyed by its new owner and includes Restoration Records, Period Service Records, Tool Kit + Jack, Manuals, Spare Wheel, Top Cover, and service manuals.  Contact Seller"

A very clean CarFax tracks mileage to assure accuracy.

You have power windows, locks, cruise control, captains chairs with arm rests, bench back seat, nice stereo system and lots of chrome trim throughout. A professional grade bedliner installed in case you actually want to haul something. I have gone through an extensive reconditioning process to assure she is mechanically sound and ready for years of driving. The entire cooling system was replaced including the water pump, radiator, thermostat, serpentine belt and hoses. Installed a brand-new alternator and battery, spent more than $2,500 replacing every component of the AC system (compressor, lines, condenser, accumulator, etc.) as well as having the dealer remove the dash to replace the evaporator. It blows ice cold now and the heater works perfectly as well. A complete fluid change all around with new exhaust header gaskets, valve cover gaskets, intake manifold gaskets and draining the transmission fluid, replacing the filter and installing a new pan gasket. Fresh front-end components and alignment so she tracks perfectly and cruises nicely at 80+ on the Montana highways. #brunoclassics Additional images and videos available  $15,000"

It is powered by the revised, matching numbers 3.0 liter V12 engine that is linked to a 4-speed manual gearbox with an overdrive on the 3rd and 4th gears. The Ferrari has disc brakes all around, and was one of the first production cars with independent front suspension. The engine is the famous Colombo V12 that delivers about 240 hp at 7000 rpm. Remarkable performance at the time for a 2+2. The 250 GTE was also an important car for the future of Ferrari. The success of this model convinced Ferrari that there was a market for more practical, high-end sports cars. This led to the development of later 2+2 models such as the 330 GT 2+2 and the 365 GT 2+2.
