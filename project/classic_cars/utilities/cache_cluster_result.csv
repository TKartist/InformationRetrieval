After the 300 SL was introduced, an American Mercedes importer noticed that many people were interested, but that the 300 SL was too expensive for what most wanted to spend on a weekend car. After a phone call with Germany, everything accelerated; later that year the 190 SL appeared at the New York show. A year later, the production version was ready in Geneva. Remarkably, not as a sports car, but as a comfortable twoseater. This became a great success, from 1955 to 1963 more than 25.000 cars were produced in Germany. Our 190 SL is from 1961, when smoking and ivory were still very normal, and was brought to the Netherlands in 1994. There the car remained in the family until 2019, after which it went to a Dutch collector. This collector decided to thin out his collection and now we were able to add the 190 to ours. The 190 SL is in good condition, and it even participated in the historic Zolder Grand Prix twice. Not for racing, fortunately, because it was never meant for that, but for strolling.

264,q1,2337,d2338,264,3.9242378466304473,mercedes bmw x1,BMW,2800CS,"BMW 2800CS 1971 $85,000 Chassis # 2204412 The BMW 2800 CS was the first in a series of coupes produced from 1968 to 1975, internally known as the BMW E9. The Karmanndesigned 2800 CS replaced the 2000 C and CS and used a new straightsix engine dubbed the M30. The larger engine required both the wheelbase and the overall length of the car to be increased, yet the car was still lighter and more agile than the series it was replacing, weighing in at 1,420 kg . The 2.8 L engine put out 168 hp through a 4speed manual transmission. Only 276 examples of the 2800 CS were produced in 1971 out of a total of 6,283 produced over four years before the E9 range was replaced by the E24 6 Series. As a followup to the BMW New Class line, the 2800 CS continued the automakers pursuit of creating sporty automobiles while retaining the luxurious feel they had come to be known for. Many of the design cues used on the 2800 CS, like the longer nose and straightsix engine, would become staples of BMW and give the car both a timeless look and modern usability in todays traffic environment. Today, the 2800CS remains highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike. Thanks to their low production numbers, timeless good looks, and a high degree of useability, they have garnered a fantastic following in the collector car community. Pricing over the past 5 years has been steady with a general upward trend. We see these cars as solid investments, not very likely to pop in value but also highly unlikely to lose any value as well. They present a fantastic opportunity to purchase and use the car as intended while retaining the money invested. As is the case with any collector car, finding an example with great history and nontraditional colors is always the safest bet. This particular example, Chassis # 2204412, is an extremely original example that was owned and lovingly preserved by the same family for over 50 years. In that time, it has retained its original engine, much of its original paint, and all of its matching interior. It shows incredible indicators of originality, including factory stickers, inspection markings, and clamps. It was purchased new by Mr. Falk from AutosImport S.A. of Geneva, Switzerland, in 1971 with a Sahara paint job and a tan woolen interior with corduroy cloth inserts. Original equipment includes power steering, fourwheel disc brakes, a rearwindow defroster, and a Blaupunkt radio. The original owner passed away a short two years after purchasing the car, upon which it was passed down to his son. The son continued to own and meticulously maintain the car throughout the years, often at the same dealer it was purchased from. In 1996, the BMW was imported stateside through American Lamprecht, Inc. in Lawrence, NY, and was appraised in July of that same year by a company in Rowayton, CT, with just 41,466 kilometers on the odometer. In 2001 and 2007, it was entered in the Greenwich Concours dElegance and won best in class in the 2001 show. The meticulous service records continued, with the front brake calipers having been rebuilt in 2012 at La Jolla Independent BMW Service of La Jolla, CA. After 48 years of ownership, the son listed the BMW for sale on Bring a Trailer, where it was purchased by our client and current consignor. Services under its new owner began in 2021 with a new tailpipe installed at European Auto Center Repair in Norwalk, CT. In May of 2021, the car underwent a major service at Sports Car Restoration in Plainville, CT, that would last through October of that same year and total almost $20,000. During that time, it received new ignition wires, a new distributor cap, a new rotor, new fuel and coolant hoses, new carburetor chokes, a valve cover gasket, a rebuilt speedometer, odometer, and turn signals, some electric window repairs, and a replacement transmission. The transmission was replaced due to excessive grinding in the original gearbox. A used ZF S516 FourSpeed gearbox, in great condition, was sourced and installed, and the original was kept and will be included with the sale of the vehicle. The exterior, interior, underbody, and engine bay were also thoroughly cleaned and degreased during the service and areas at risk of rust were coated in a preventative wax coating. In November of 2022, the car visited Rennsport Automotive in Bedford Hills, NY, for new fluids as well as new spark plugs, distributor points, condenser, cap, and rotor. The valve cover gasket was also replaced alongside new V belts and a power steering filter. As it sits, following the numerous services it underwent in the past two years, this BMW 2800 CS is now a turnkey timecapsule example ready to take on anything from twisty roads to more concour shows. With largely original paint, an incredible original interior, all of the original equipment and accessories, and just ~30,000 original miles on the odometer, this rare German saloon with only one family ownership for 50 years is the pinnacle of automotive preservation. Upon purchase, the new owner will receive the original purchase agreement, all of the importation documents and service records going back to new, manufacturers literature, 1970s first aid kit and roadside assistance kit, tools, spare parts, and upholstery fabric, a GPS unit, a radar detector, and a BMW car cover.

267,q1,881,d882,267,3.5639808332853016,mercedes bmw x1,BMW,Z3,"BMW Z3 1978 $38,000 VIN # WBSCK9333XLC89705 The reintroduced popularity of the roadster body style brought about by the Mazda Miata in North America necessitated a reaction from the European Makes to offer their own interpretation on the genre after helping establish a market in the midcentury. BMW entered into the fray in 1995 with the Z3. In classic roadster fashion, a long hood and short rear deck composed the overall shape. However, the lines were far from the typical teutonic straightedges commonly seen in the period, and instead, designer Joji Nagashima employed the softer, rounder shapes from the roadsters of the past. Every single body panel possesses some form of curvature, an element that surely gave the manufacturing side of the business a bit of a headache. Fortunately, it all works quite well, and today, the Z3 looks like nothing BMW has put out before or since, and the boldness of the design has aged remarkably well. Enthusiasts of the brand might have been saddened to see an inline6 unavailable at launch under that long hood, but all could rest assured that BMW would deliver soon enough. Many could be satisfied with the lightness and responsiveness of the 4cylinder models, but more power always tends to make things better. Just a year after the cars introduction, the traditional Inline6 arrived along with deliciously punched out fenders allowing for a 2.5inch wider rear track. It was only a matter of time now before the Mdivision got its hands on the little roadster. Falling in line with E36 M3, North American examples of the new Z3 M Roadster were fitted with the S52 engine upon release. While down on power from its more exotic, individual throttlebodied cousin, this bored and stroked M52 motor is not without its merits in the context of the contemporary automotive scene. At the end of the day, a naturally aspirated inline6 with a 7,000rpm redline makes for an enticing proposition to any gearhead. The Z3 M Roadster on offer here, chassis # WBSCK9333XLC89705, is a 1owner example finished in Estoril Blue over a full black interior. Showing just 24,266 miles this is one of the most well cared for examples we have handled. Delivered new to Roadshow BMW in Tennessee, the car was immediately sent to its one and only owner in Decatur, Illinois. From here the owner began thoroughly enjoying the Z3 as he put roughly 6,000 miles on the car in its first two summers. Over the next 6 years usage became less frequent but still regular with proper maintenance carried out along the way. As it sits today this Z3 is entirely unmodified and ready for continued use after a baseline fluids swap as the last service was done in late 2020, or roughly 1,000 miles ago. This Z3 M Roadster presents a great opportunity to acquire a collector grade example of the platform. With a handwritten log documenting every service and the miles corresponding to them you know exactly how meticulously maintained the car really is. Included in the sale are the tools, first aid kit, black leather tonneau cover, the Z3 Roadster branded tonneau carrier case, and available service records and logs.

Factory Sunroof. Spare Tire, Comprehensive Service Records. I've had the car since 1992 and have driven it about 45,000 miles since. Had it up to 150mph through the desert on the way back from California after I bought it there so the top factory speed of 143 is incorrect. Engine was rebuilt as it was burning oil and now it's fine all the receipts are in hand and it was done by a German owned and operated small import repair shop in Chicago as referenced above. The German owner would probably be happy to answer questions about the rebuild and the car upon special request but I don't want to burden him with calls at this point. Likewise the car was stored for a long time and I wanted to get it back to 100% shape looks wise so I had Joe Filek at Captain America Designs in Hampshire, Illinois do all the stripping and body work at a cost in excess of $10k and had him reinstall the rechromed bumpers. Update 8/8/2022 although $2k Climate Control Servo installed the system needs some kind of repair on that. This MercedesBenz manufactured Homologation Special Edition was specially built in production form to qualify for FIA racing standards, meaning in order to competitively race MercedesBenz had to create at least 1000 production vehicles to accompany official rally cars it wanted to race competitively. The 450SLC 5.0/500SLC coupes were produced by MercedesBenz from 1978 to 1981 and are among the rarest postwar models. They were manufactured by Mercedes Benz to homologate the 5 liter for road rally purposes. Some cars were competitively campaigned with factory support, but the rest of the production was sold to the European market to meet homologation guidelines. The combination of the lighter weight and higher horsepower made for a quick and competitive car which raced successfully with the introduction of the 5 literengine in the World Rally Championship Series including First Place finishes in 1979 and 1980 at the Ivory Coast Rally. Other notable participation in competition included the Rally of Argentina, Rally of New Zealand, Acropolis Rally and Portugal Rally. The cars were given massive factory support under the leadership of Eric Waxenberger. The fact that the Managing Board of MBAG officially withdrew from world rallying in 1980 makes the 5.0 the last factorysponsored wholly Mercedes model. The rally racing clock for MercedesBenz ended for good with the success of this homologated SLC special. The Last photo in the gallery is of500SLC Rally cars Four 450 SLC 5.0 being cleaned at a rally in 1979 Along with the performance enhancements and plaudits which are detailed below, this car's comfort and daily drivability combined with every modern amenity led renowned championship drivers of the time period to use them as personal getarounds.1979 World Champion Driver of Ferrari Team Jody Scheckter chose this as his personal car. Jean Pierre Ganier and Patrick Depailler of the Tyrrell Formula 1 team also chose the 500 as their daily drivers. 2769 of the 500SLC's were made over 2 years in 198081 and fewer than 100 cars were imported into the United States. In 1999 MercedesBenz SLC specialist Bob Hatch of Hatch and Sons estimated that at most there might be 50 of these cars in the country good enough to interest a collector, but in the years since his statement, given the drivability of the these cars, there are certainly significantly less than that at present. The example be offered here is certainly in the very top echelon of those Mr. Hatch was speaking of due to its meticulous care over the years and frankly I'd be surprised if there's one in better condition after the engine rebuild and bodywork/painting rechroming, re'tiring' and all the miscellaneous new parts anywhere. This example differs from the stock 450SLCs in several important and distinctive ways. The hood and trunk lids are made from aluminum for significant weight savings. The car weighs 3,333lbs, 220lbs less than the standard SLC. To emphasize the lengths to which MB went to upgrade the car for homologation, it even has an alloy air cleaner to add to the weight savings. The front and rear aerodynamic spoilers the factory added result in a 9 10 % reduction in wind resistance and a top speed which exceeds 142MPH. The 5.0 is the very first MercedesBenz aluminum block V8 production motor and is lighter than the standard iron block . It produces in excess of a whopping 300 HP and 350lbs of torque and true blacktop powerhouse in its day. The 5.0 engine features factory reworked heads with larger valves, pressure fed valve adjusters, crossbolted main bearing caps and many other special tweaks. The 500SLC also features the upgraded 4speed automatic. There's a window until late October/early November where this car is for sale/viewing/driving as it won't see a drop of rain or snow and certainly not salt while it's under my care. $65,900",9

This car is more than just a vehicle, it's a piece of history, a testament to the golden age of automotive design. It's not just a car, it's a lifestyle, a statement, a symbol of elegance and sophistication. This beautiful machine has been lovingly cared for by three owners, all of whom have kept it safely tucked away in a garage, preserving its charm and character. It has a new exhaust system including new chrome pipes.Its sleek silver exterior, a $5,000.00 recent paint job addition, gleams like a moonbeam, turning heads wherever it goes. Under the hood, the engine purrs like a wellfed cat, with a compression of 150 psi in five of the six cylinders and 145 psi in the remaining one. The tires, though not brand new, still have plenty of life left in them, with 5/32 tread on the front from 2000 and 8/32 on the rear from 2005. The brake pads and rotors are in good condition, ensuring a smooth and safe ride. However, like any classic car, it has its quirks. There are small oil leaks, some radiator corrosion, and the idler arm bushing shows some wear. The interior is a sight to behold, with excellent leather seats that cradle you in comfort. The back of the driver seat is coming loose, but it's a minor issue that should be easy to fix. The front passenger carpet shows fraying. The odometer is inoperable, showing 2050 miles, but we believe it has likely rolled over to 102,050 miles. The car runs beautifully, but does experience some stalling when coming to a stop, which we suspect may be a fuel pump issue. Despite these minor issues, this car is a gem, a true classic that will bring joy to any car enthusiast. This car comes with a treasure trove of original documents, including the maintenance manual from the first owner, the original MercedesBenz dealer's book from October 15, 1971, the maintenance booklet, the owner's manual, and the MercedesBenz 1970 catalog. This car is being sold on behalf of a dear friend who unfortunately passed away in a motorcycle accident. His widow has made the difficult decision to part with this beautiful machine. This is a unique opportunity to own a piece of automotive history, and to continue the legacy of care and love that this car has always known. This 1972 Mercedes 280 SE is more than just a car. It's a statement, a lifestyle, a piece of history and would be considered in between excellent and good condition. It's waiting for the right person to write the next chapter of its story. Could that person be you? $15,000",9

Despite this minor disappointment, these cars remain absolutely stunning! The XK150 is distinguished from its predecessors by the curved windscreen, which is now a single piece instead of a split window. In addition, the grille in the nose is slightly wider and the windscreen has been moved back slightly, giving the nose an even more imposing look.
