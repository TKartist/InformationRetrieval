This award winning 67 GTO Hardtop Coupe was ordered from the factory with special metallic paint Plum Mist and factory air. While this was a GM color, Pontiac stopped offering plumb mist on the GTO in 1966. Born in Pontiac, Michigan on October 31st, this special order GTO was delivered to Smith Motor Company in Laurens, South Carolina. Years later the car was found abandoned in a Texas auto body shop, when it later underwent a complete frame off rotisserie restoration in 2016. The car has its numbers matching Pontiac 400 4bbl with 335hp, threespeedTurboHydramaticTH400, which was equipped with aHurst Performancedualgate shifter, called a ""his/hers"" shifter, that permitted either automatic shifting in ""drive"" or manual selection through the gears. Everything works as it should and it is documented that the car has been driven less than 2600 miles since restoration. It has always been stored in a climatecontrolled garage. The car comes with restoration documentation as well as Pontiac Historical Societys documentation of the special paint code and window sticker. It received the Restored Auto award at the 2021 Good Guys car show. All sheet metal is original other than the hood which was purchased after the original was damaged by the sand blasting process. The exhaust and headers were replaced during restoration and provides a great rumble from the stock 400. Designed by John DeLorean, the Pontiac GTO is considered of the most desirable cars of the muscle car era. The 1967 is often considered the most desirable, featuring sleek design updates to the hood, grill and taillights. I am sad to see my baby go, but it is time to turn over the keys and let someone else enjoy this classic icon of American car history. $74,900",26

6,q1,2854,d2855,6,7.667175213197657,bmw volk,Delahaye,135 Competition,"Delahaye 135 Competition 1936 $12,000,000 This is the 1936 ""Talk of Paris"" car, the beginning of the famed Figoni Streamlined Teardrop Period, an objet d'art This 1936 135 Competition Disappearing Top Convertible is notable for many reasons, including its streamlined flowing objet d'art design by Joseph Figoni, with the Figoni et Falaschi patented disappearing top, pioneered on this car . It was specially ordered when new to be equally at home on a boulevard... or on a racetrack. It has a racing engine, gearbox and chassis. It is restored to 100point level for Concours d'Elegance competition, and is the winner of numerous prestigious concours awards. But most importantly, as the premier example of 1930s French coachbuilding, this beautiful automobile can be seen and valued as fine art, with all the implications for further appreciation that the fine art market commands. Mobile art; A true movable feast for the eyes. The chassis 46864 is correct in all respects Club Delahaye France Archives Rarely do competitive racing chassis and engine and imaginative aerodynamic coachwork come together in the same car. This was Figoni et Falaschi's signature style applied to a convertible... the new flowing streamlined coachwork for which FigoniFalaschi would become internationally famous. It most dramatically illustrates Figonis famed streamlined creations, in this case for a wealthy Parisian named Wolf, a personal friend of Figonis. Wolf could afford the best of the best, so he challenged Delahaye and Figoni to create a car with elegant line, fine et elance, with the fast and reliable Competition 3.5 liter sixcylinder engine, and the competition chassis... bearing in mind his intent to race the car and enter in rallies, as well as concours events and various showings for Figoni. This is one of the most elegant creations of Joseph Figoni and one of the most important Delahaye cars. Club Delahaye France Archives The Delahaye Type 135 Competition longwheelbase chassis was a factory competition special, ordered by Monsieur Wolf to satisfy his purposes of personal use, concours events and racing requirements. At Delahaye, the competition engine was placed into the rugged Type 135 Competition chassis, a durable advanced design for its time, proved in the coming years at races like the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This Delahaye 135 Competition Convertible has been authenticated by Club Delahaye France, and Figoni records, as the original body and chassis with all pertinent numbers on the car matching the original Figoni and Delahaye records. The Competition Engine. The car is powered by a 3.5 liter overhead valve, 120 horsepower, inline sixcylinder Delahaye engine, foundrymarked T35 . It is coupled to a rugged 4speed manual competition transmission with synchromesh on the top three gears. This car was ordered with the competition engine version, with a matched set of triple downdraft Solex 40PAI carburetors, a highercompression cylinder head, an oil cooler, and two fuel fillers in the trunk. The engine and 4speed competition gearbox are positioned low in the chassis, thus contributing to the benefits of a betterbalanced vehicle. In the front, you'll find an independent suspension using transverse leaf springs as the lower control arm . Powerful brakes and 17"" RudgeWhitworth chromed wire wheels with 5,60 x 6,00 Michelin tires were fitted. The wheelbase is 116 inches, front track is 54 7/8 inches, and rear track is 58 3/4 inches. Other special competition components include: When Joseph Figoni took delivery of Wolf's rolling chassis from the Delahaye factory, he set out to make the most streamlined body possible. He wanted the convertible top to be lowered within the body. Today, we take this complex process for granted. But back then, Figoni, a streamlining pioneer, had to invent a very effective disappearing top for this car. The folding mechanism is described in French Patent 795.769, Perfectionnements aux vhicules dcapotables, applied for October 1, 1935 and issued January 13, 1936, just preceding the construction of this car. The Type 135 Competition would be successful on nearly every venue in which it competed. It earned victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the MonteCarlo Rallye, the ParisSaintRaphael race, several Grand Prix races, and many other events both before and after WWII. In 1937, a year after this longwheelbase 135 Competition was delivered to Monsieur Wolf, similar Type 135 Competitions won the Monte Carlo Rallye, and placed first and second at Le Mans. And our car, so beautiful at Concours showings, is an integral part of that championship heritage, itself placing 6th in the 1949 Monte Carlo Rallye out of a field of 230 cars, in an extremely difficult and dangerous race on the rutted muddy wreckstrewn roads of postwar Europe. This flowing teardrop is Figoni one of one piece unique, combining the Delahaye identity in the grille and hood with generous teardrop fenders flanking Marchal headlights tucked tightly to the grille and a pair of separately controlled Marchal fog lights fitted low below them. The fender shape is echoed at the rear with skirts enclosing the rear tires. Chrome accents highlight the fender trailing edges matching the chrome accent sweeping back from the peak of the grille, down across the doors then filling the rear fender joint and small chrome spline down the rear deck. The lines are beyond stunning. Monsieur Wolf granted the privilege of showing his car to his close friend Figoni, for tours and other showings of the new streamlined coachwork. Figoni himself drove this car, as Wolfs eyesight was poor enough to limit his driving. Later, Wolf hired the famous French racing team of Guy Mairesse and Paul Valle to campaign the car in various racing events. We have a photo of the team piloting the car in the Rallye de Monte Carlo in 1949, kindly supplied by Claude Figoni, Josephs son. You'll appreciate the gorgeous interior's sparkling jewellike engineturned dashboard, soft and supple light gray quill ostrich leather seats and door panels, piped in dark blue leather. The lightcolored upholstery is a perfect complement for the stunning Bleu Fonc exterior and works perfectly with the turned pattern dash and beautiful wood accents. Carpets are dark blue as is the soft top and trunk lining. There are so many small touches that make this car unique like the upswept curve at the center base of the folding windshield, a theme picked up on the polished wood door panels, and on the upholstery. And, the car also has a set of matching fitted luggage as per the original build sheet. The luggage is finished in reverse colors of dark blue quill ostrich with gray edging and handles. The entire ensemble of internationally competitive streamlined teardrop windcheating luxury coachwork is simply breathtaking. In excellent 100point condition, she's ready for the next owner to take to the finest concours or rally events and compete for Best Of Show with every prospect of success. She? Mais oui... ceci est une belle voiture franaise, aprs tout! Refined meticulously detailed elegance and streamlined design combine masterfully with competition engine and chassis in this piece unique objet dart, consistently judged to be one of Joseph Figonis finest creations. Show, tour or simply stare at her; a visual feast; to be savored and enjoyed as both movable art and a solid investment. $12,000,000",37

Fourwheel disc brakes were standard, and the heatexhaust venting worked into the front fenders was now functional. Smoother lines on the hood and grille made the car more stylish. Cosmetically restored in 2017, the example being offered here is a beautiful vehicle equipped with an A.O. Smith body. With a detailed engine bay and underside, this convertible is being sold with its auxiliary hardtop included. The car showcases itself almost delicately in its correct eyecatching Goldwood Yellow exterior, augmented by a black softtop and matched interior. However, any ideas of being domesticated disappear as the 327/365 HP V8 engine comes to life. This is the solidlifter version of Zora ArkusDuntovs legendary smallblock, which features among its attributes the GM block casting number , head casting number , intake casting number and even the No. 2818A carburetor under the chrome air cleaner. A fresh water pump and battery are among its more recent refinements. The highwinding engine is backed by a closeratio Muncie 4speed transmission and a 4.11:1 Positraction rear end. Other unique points of interest are the knockoff wheels with whitestripe tires, sidemounted exhaust pipes, Teakwood steering wheel and optional AM/FM radio with power antenna. The interior also features the redesigned cues for 65, such as widepadded bucket seats and molded door paneling with arm rests. Coupled with the first bigblock models arriving at midyear, many consider 1965 to be a pivotal season for Americas Sports Car. In terms of color, only Tuxedo Black came on fewer editions in 1965 than Goldwood Yellow, and the driveline options on this example make it a standout in terms of true street performance.

The custom interior includes champagne leather seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, matching carpeted floor mats, smoke colored Ttop removable roof panels, matching carpeted luggage area with black concealment shade.The rear window hatch was engineered with hinged glass to open on the Collector Edition Corvette, rather than a fixed window.Although due to a design flaw, most hinges fail after regular use. Collector Edition Corvettes also has standard equipment that was optional on other 82 corvettes such as electric windows, sixway power drivers seat, power door locks, cruise control, automatic electric antenna, power mirrors, rear window defogger, etc. The 5.7liter, 350 cubic inch, L83 V8 uses Crossfire fuel injection which features two crossmounted 48mm throttlebody injection units. Each throttlebody feeds one bank of cylinders on the v8 engine. This gives it 200 horsepower at 4,200 rpm and 285 lb.ft of torque. During full throttle a solenoid operated door in the hood opened to allow air directly into the air cleaner. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a fourspeed automatic transmission and a limitedslip differential. This car can move. 1982 corvettes came with a fourspeed automatic transmission with overdrive and a lockup torqueconverter clutch breakthrough technology at the time. The collector edition includes standard features such as power steering and brakes, a telescoping and tilting steering wheel, pop up halogen headlamps, full instrumentation such as fuel, oil pressure and temp gages, tachometer, and voltage.Fourwheel independent suspension.Limited slip 2.87 differential. An authentic Collector Edition Corvette will have a 0 as the sixth character in its VIN as this car does.Production was limited to 6,759 cars.This makes this car a rarity. About this Collector Edition Corvette I Bought this Vette here in Maryland in late 1984 from a GM mechanic who loved it but couldnt afford it.It had about 20,000 miles on the odometer. Today its 61,000 miles. For a few years I commuted in it, before making it my weekend ride. Its always been garaged, even at the office. My employer paid for all maintenance and repairs, so nothing needed was missed. To my knowledge, the car has not been in an accident and the engine is original. Restoration Over the past 12 months, Ive invested over $10,000 in restoration. All documented.Including: Additional Features Also included is a custom cotton dust cover and a framed poster of the 1982 Collector Edition Corvette.The dust cover is especially helpful for protecting the car in your garage. I have the original keys, as well as several copies.Plus, the original Ttop leather storage covers, original owners manual and the Chevrolet Corvette service manual are included.See photos. Notice the champagne leather Ttop bracket bag in the back this is for the optional: Roof Panel Carrier.It contains mounting brackets for the Ttops when theyre off the car.I have included photos of the mounting frames.Theyre like new.Ive never seen these offered for sale in like new condition. Not a Perfect Car There is a scratch on the passenger door, which Ive shown in the photos.I had a recent quote of $350 to repaint the door.Ive also highlighted a few other flaws, no matter how trivial, in the photos. Aside from the Air Conditioning, all power features and gauges on this car work.The air conditioning compressor runs, but needs Freon.The rear windows on Collector Edition Corvettes nearly all have problems opening due to the design flaw in the hinges.The release handle on this car does not allow the rear window to open. Want to learn more? Id be glad to put a prospective buyer in touch with both the local Corvette mechanics whove recently worked on the car.Theyre more than happy to speak with you.You are also welcome to hire a mechanic for an independent opinion on the car.Of course, I will answer any questions you might have to the best of my knowledge. Asking Price The asking price is not arbitrary nor based on an inflated opinion of the cars condition.After much study, I set the asking price based on the recent sale of a Collector Edition Corvette, in very similar condition and owner history.That car sold for $29,400 at auction sixteen months ago. Auctions are a strong indicator of true market value.Ive observed at least eight other completed auctions of similar vehicles in that price range in the past two years.Allowing for the air conditioning and the scratch on the door, Ive set my price slightly lower.I believe its a very fair market price for this car. Why you should seriously consider this car Buying this car is like stepping back in time to 1982. Its in showroom condition. I love this car, but Im selling it to make room in my garage for some other projects.Ive thoroughly enjoyed it, but now its time to pass it on to bring joy and someone else. When I sell a car, my name goes on the bill of sale.There should be no surprises for the buyer.Ive made every effort to be candid about the true condition of the car. Every repair expense since Ive owned it is fully documented and indexed in a binder.See photos.These records are included with the car so you can protect your investment. When you buy a car from a dealer, you dont know the history of ownership and care.This dramatically increases your risk.With this car, you have a wealth of information available to you.Including a 40year ownership history.Plus the recent investment of over $10,000 in restoration.All fully documented. A quality classic corvette is an investment.They always go up in value.If you compromise your standards, and buy a low priced, low quality, classic car, youre setting yourself up for failure if you ever choose to sell it.But if you buy a high quantity specimen, like this one, and take good care of it, youll do very well if you decide to sell it.Thats far more important than bargain hunting or haggling for a great deal.Think strategically about the long game for your investment.Dont let this one get away. Summary This is a high end, recently restored collector vehicle.If you want a C3 Collector Edition Corvette in original condition, that you wont have to spend time and money on to drive and enjoy after you invest in it, with a known and documented history, this car wont disappoint you. $27,950",10
180,q1,4304,d4305,180,6.7545590571263245,bmw volk,Chevrolet,Corvette,"Chevrolet Corvette 1977 $32,200 1977 CORVETTE L82 LISTING ID CC1744856 ORIGINAL OWNER The auto for sale is a late production L82 Corvette delivered to a GM dealer in Detroit who immediately assigned it to the body shop where the entire car wasblocked, sanded, and covered with 6 coats of black lacquer paint. When finished, it was gifted to his nephew, a newly minted Medical Doctor. In the interim the Doctor had accepted a position in France, so he took possession, drove to Minneapolis then sold it to me in early November 1977. Since then it has been meticulously maintained for a very demanding Mechanical Engineer. Effectively I am the original owner although technically the car has been mine for 46 years less the few weeks it was in transit. In Minneapolis the car was stored in a heated garage from October to May every year until 1986 when it was relocated to California and then to Arizona, where it has been garaged ever since. The 1977 Corvette is a beautiful automobile, but this model year also had some significant disappointments. The 1977 Corvette is a 3500pound sport car designed to operate with 350+ horsepower. By 1977 the L82 engine output had been reduced by almost 150 HP due to emission controls. in my opinion, this model with 210 HP is underpowered and, even with the California Emission Certification option installed, it still failed to meet California or Canadian emission standards. The shortcoming was addressed by Twin City Racing in Minneapolis who Installed an Edelbrok performance intake manifold and in 1984 after a 2year year search installed a factory set of 2.17 Chevy heads. Estimated improvement 100115 HP, several years later a custom exhaust system was fabricated and installed. The factory double y single cat converter system was replaced with larger diameter straight pipes utilizing exhaust routing layouts designed into the Corvette frame. Another catalytic converter and twin high bypass mufflers completed the design. The results were amazing! Emissions for hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, idle and loaded, were roughly 90% lower than Arizona mandates. A copy of the last emission test is attached. As this Corvette sits today, it has roughly 350 horsepower, was licensed in California for 14 years and had noproblempassing California emission protocols. If the buyer prefers a Survivor car most original factory parts are like new, including AM/FM stereo radio, clock, radiator tanks, set of 2.02 heads, intake manifold and other spare parts. It was last repainted in 1997. In 2004 Mike Scott, a Corvette judge and owner of Corvette Corrections in Anaheim California appraised the car for not less than $20,000 in 2023 dollars. In the appraisal he also said this is one of the nicest 1977 Corvettes I have inspected. It is also one of the rarest by color combination. Black exterior and smoke gray leather interior. This car has been kept in very good condition inside and out. This vehicle is also highly optioned. A copy of the appraisal is attached. Maintenance log is available. $32,200",10

Power is supplied by a 390cid V8 and backed by an automatic transmission. The attached picture is a screenshot referenced from the ""Vintage Thunderbird Club International, Original Factory Specifications, Volume 4, November 2002"" magazine. As indicated, there were only 17 ""M"" code Hardtop models produced in 1962, ""seventeen"". That alone makes this car very rare. This car is a survivor and to my knowledge, all equipment on this car is original except items that would have been replaced due to normal wear. If the person that purchases the car desires, I still have all the parts I have had replaced. Features include a SwingAway steering wheel; power windows, door locks, and drivers seat; factory air conditioning; and 48spoke KelseyHayes chrome wire wheels. Many new parts have been installed including the tires, brakes, fuel pump, fuel lines, brake booster, spark plugs, and wires. This Rangoon Red Thunderbird with a reported 58,874 original miles and a white leather interior comes with receipts, parts records, and a clear title. My restoration efforts have all been focused on getting the car back in road worthy condition, which it is. I have not had any interior or exterior cosmetic processes performed on this car. This will allow the new owner to put their stamp on the car by performing only the work they want. This Rangoon Red Thunderbird hardtop reportedly still wears its factory chrome and stainless trim, emblems, and handles. The original headlights, grille, and bumper can be seen at the front. The factory bumper with integrated taillights and fuel door is mounted at the rear. The seller states a cosmetic piece at the bottom of the antenna is missing and there are spots of rust at the back wheel well. There is no rust on the underside of the car. A set of 14inch chrome 48spoke KelseyHayes wire wheels with tribar center caps are wrapped in 215/75/14 whitewall tires. The interior is furnished with original white leather front bucket seats with factory seat belts and a matching rear seat. This Thunderbird features the SwingAway steering wheel. With the transmission in park, the steering wheel and column slide 18 inches to the right, allowing the driver to exit the cabin easily. The steering column is topped with a threespoke white steering wheel with a chrome horn ring. The padded dashboard is white on the bottom and contrasting gold on the top, split by ribbed trim that flows down into the center console, which houses a 120mph speedometer, a clock, and a fuel/temperature gauge. The odometer shows 58,874, which the seller states is accurate. The engine is an Mcode version of the 390cid V8. The Mcode option featured three twobarrel Holley carburetors and produced 340 horsepower. Factory chrome valve covers, a finned openelement air cleaner, and new spark plugs and wires complete the engine. Factory power brakes, air conditioning, power steering, and a mechanical radiator fan can be found under the hood. According to the seller, it was originally purchased by the late Aurelbelle Shaffer, who was the wife of the late Raymond Shaffer, the former president of Greyhound. Aurelbelle drove this Thunderbird as her second car and always kept it parked under a carport in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 1992, the car was placed in a storage facility in Arizona and kept there until it was moved to Georgia in 2010. The car remains in a building and has only been driven very sparingly since 1973. Receipts for parts and service work will be included in the sale. $24,900",5

For instance, the design behind this 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air Coupe, dressed in a twotone red and white exterior, screams oldschool luxury and style and belongs on the sets of Hollywood. What makes this car stand out is its factory styling done to perfection; all its exterior trim is present and in excellent condition, with the current owner reporting new chrome trim. For that added factory appeal, this 50s beauty sits on its factory hubcaps that are wrapped with whitewall tires, with the driver having the option to finetune the ride height through an adjustable airbag suspension system. Matching the twotone red and white exterior is a matching interior. Like the exterior, the interior is factory spec and made to stand out and stay true to character. Step in, and you will find the car's interior components present and in great shape; you get A/C to weather those hot summer cruises and power windows and steering in place to make every drive effortless. Engine Considering the condition of this 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air Coupe exterior and interior, it's unsurprising that this American legend's engine bay is in mint condition. Open the hood, and you are treated to the sight of a 283ci straight six powertrain neatly nestled in and providing decent performance. The highlighting factor, however, is not the performance but how clean the engine bay is. Components like the carburetor and other mechanical components stand out, shine out, and are ready to be featured in any automotive magazine. Power is sent to the car's rear wheels in true oldschool fashion through a 3onthetree manual transmission. $48,000",5

Mileage shows as 98,052 which is believed to be correct. The wagon spent its life up until late 2019 in Virginia. I am the 5th Owner. It has one repaint in the original Loch Haven Green color which matches the trim tag. There is no rust in the body. There are photos included of the wheel wells showing this. The wood is original except for some small repairs, and is in good condition. The fabric top was replaced within the last 15 years, and is in good condition. A set of metal drip edges for the top were acquired by the previous owner after the top work was done. He felt that the edging was well done when the top was replaced & did not justify tearing it up to install the steel ones. They are included in the sale. Mechanical: At some point before the previous Owners purchase a Ford 8BA flathead V8 was installed. He installed a new radiator, shroud, & Drake high efficiency water pumps, and it runs cool even on hot Savannah days. He had the car rewired including a plug for the boat trailer. The boat trailer currently does not have lights or wiring. A vintage turn signal kit was installed when the wiring was done, & it works great. All lights & the horn work. The radio & gauges were rebuilt when the wiring was done & they work fine. Previous owner replaced the gas tank, generator, voltage regulator, carburetor, and stock lever action shocks. Since purchasing the car I have installed a Pertronix ignition system w/ Pertronix plug wires and coil, new spark plugs, a new alternator charging set up, all new Bendix/Self Adjusting brakes on all 4 wheels, and a new 6 volt battery. Interior: The wagon has all 3 seats. The leather seating surfaces are in excellent condition with no visible wear, rips, etc. I installed all new rubber floor mats from front to rear with insulation. I also installed new interior & exterior mirrors, sun visors, and rear window hardware. The previous owner installed new dash plastic, & rebuilt the gauges & radio. Chassis & undercarriage As stated above the brake system was replaced with Bendix/Self Adjusting drum brakes. The mufflers were replaced with new glass pack units received when the car was purchased. The dual exhaust system is tight and not objectionably loud. There is an electric fuel pump near the tank that has been replaced under my ownership, & it works fine. Other than mild surface rust & grime the chassis is in fine condition. There are no noted leaks from the brake system. The tires are relatively new Coker radials that are in good condition. Driveability I keep a 6 volt Battery Tender on the car, and it starts easily, comes to an easy idle with some use of the choke, warms quickly, and drives out with no problems. Lets face it this is an 82 year old vehicle that is built more like a piece of furniture than a modern car! Steering does not shimmy but can be somewhat vague. Brakes, even w/ the Bendix units, are not 4 wheel discs. Leave room in traffic! 1953 Fleetcraft Runabout & 15hp Evinrude Outboard Boat: from what I can find 1953 may be the first year that Fleetcraft made a fiberglass hulled boat. There is no data plate or serial # on the boat. The previous Owner bought the boat at an auction in PA, which makes sense since Fleetcraft boats were originally made in SE PA. He bought it because the hull color is such a good match w/ the wagon, plus the wood deck & interior. The hull, wood deck, & interior are all in great shape, and do not require any current work. Evinrude Fast Twin 15hp outboard can be identified as a 19531954 model from the Serial #1501201914. Since I had no plans to put the boat in the water I put oil in the cylinders, pulled it through a few times, & have not attempted to start it. There is a 6 gallon portable fuel tank that goes with the sale. Trailer: I replaced the tires, tubes, and wheel bearings. Installed a trailer dolly to aid in storage. Fun Fact: The last two years, 2021 & 2022 I have been invited to bring the woody & boat to the Hilton Head Island Concours dElegance for their 2 day On the Water display of antique water craft. They got a lot of attention! $57,500",5

This vehicle was build to be driven, daily if you so desire, that is what it is for, to drive, and have fun, not to just be parked and looked at. When I drive the car I always get the thumbs up sign from other drivers and pedestrians. The car is a magnet. And it's fun to show it off even though it's more fun to drive. The picture section depicts the two prior stages the vehicle was in prior to its road to completion. The Sierra Gold pictures show the condition when the car was acquired and restoration started The prime photo's show in stage body work and then the finished product. Included with the car is all of the invoices of work performed and receipts of parts purchased that I kept while on this mission.

I purchased this car in 2005 and have garaged it ever since; only driving for pleasure and a few trips. The car has never been used for daily transportation and has never seen snow or salt. The car had 6000 miles on it when I bought it and currently has 78000 on it. The car is regularly driven but only to keep it in good running condition. I have every service record on the car back to January 2005. The car drives as new with no rattles, etc. Everything on the car is original except for the front brakes, tail pipe assembly and tires. The original front brakes were replaced at about 76000. The tail pipe assembly from the cat converter back was replaced about 10 years ago. Apparently, a weld cracked. The dealer attributed the failure to fatigue in a weldas it is a complete assembly part. There was not a mark on itit simply just failed. The tires were also replaced at about 40000 miles. They were replaced with the Michelin high speed tire which was original equipment. Only one part is worn out on the car and needs to be replaced; the gas tubes on the trunk have dried outthey need to be replaced. They are hard to find. The car has never been driven hard and has no paint fade. The trunk is clean and without stains. The spare is original to the car I assume. I have never looked at the spare tire.The car has had minor paint work over the years. And the pictures show the car was repaired excellently, but it has had minor paint work. These are very rare and most of them wound up on low end used car lots because they were a cheap classy ride. In fact, the Infiniti dealer told me that my car is the last one they see at all.

It has not been changed since it rolled off of the showroom floor in the fall of 1961. It is complete with the 409 engine, 4speed transmission, and the Super Sport package. This survivor is one of 142 ever built. This car comes with both the Muncie and Borg and Warner 4 Speed transmission. This car in magazines: More pictures: http://www.mjpropix.com/Cars/ImpalaSuperSport/ Chevrolet brought real power to the people during 1961, and did so with style. The midyear introduction of the Super Sport option package showcased another new arrival, the 409CUIN V8. The SS kit was offered on any Impala. It included Super Sport trim inside and out, chassis reinforcements, stronger springs and shocks, power brakes with sintered metallic linings, spinner type wheel covers, and of Chevys earliest uses of narrow band whitewall tires. The dashboard gained a Corvette type grab bar, and the steering column got a 7000 RPM Tachometer. Only Chevys toughest V8s were offered with the SS package. It was available with 348CUIN with fourbarrel or tri power. The other choice was the 409. Essentially a larger displacement 348, its upgrades include forged aluminum pistons, a wilder camshaft and 11.25:1 compression. A single fourbarrel mated to the aluminum manifold. It made 360 bhp. It also made history. Chevy built 491,000 Impala for 61. Only 453 had the SS package and of those, just 142 got the 409. But word spread quickly. Here was a mainstream Chevy V8 with 409 lbft of torque and the ability to turn mid 15 second quartermiles with the standard 3.36:1 rear axle and mandatory fourspeed manual transmission.
