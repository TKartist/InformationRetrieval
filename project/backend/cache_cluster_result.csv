Car crafting had gone toward a more radical approach as the 1960s era began, and this creation aptly named Legacy captures that theme from every angle. Of course, programs of this nature began with a 'hot mill,"" as the writers would say, in the case a crrca1962 327 CI Corvette V8 engine with extensive detailing and equipped with a frontmounted 671 crankshaftdriven blower kit. Using period appearing sidedraft carburetors, gold and chrome plating with custom handengraving abound on this powerplant, while a Hurst shift arm directs the transmission behind it. From the exterior, one notes the roofline which came from a 1957 Buick is chopped 3 inched and then channeled 5 inches at the front, graduating to 2.5 inches at the rear. The rear fender wells are boxed and the fender ends themselves were extended 6 inches and raised 1.5 inches, with 1959 Cadillac tail lights installed. Even the trunk is shopped 8 inches. A 1961 Chrysler front fender assembly showcases extended angular headlamps, with the front fender wells flared with 3/4inch chromoly tubing and boxed to conceal wiring. Metal fabrication was utilized throughout the build with no fiberglass. A 1962 Jaguar independent rear suspension , front suspension and Jaguar universal joints provide underpinnings and components are either gold or chrome plated. The engine rests in handbuilt motor mounts, while brake and gas lines have been enclosed within the modified squaretube frame. The deep tones selected for the paint are dramatic, with a power blue custom interior inside. The most modern upgrade beyond that is a set of Colorado Custom wheels that put it to the pavement through BF Goodrich Radial T/A tires.

This vehicle was build to be driven, daily if you so desire, that is what it is for, to drive, and have fun, not to just be parked and looked at. When I drive the car I always get the thumbs up sign from other drivers and pedestrians. The car is a magnet. And it's fun to show it off even though it's more fun to drive.
