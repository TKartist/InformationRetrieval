This Trans Am features a nice repaint in factory Yellow, a beautiful mostly stock interior, a good running Pontiac 400 engine and a four speed manual transmission. This Trans Am is finished in the beautiful and desirable color combinations of Yellow over Black vinyl interior. This is the factory color scheme as verified on the trim tag pictured above. This factory color combination is fairly rare and I have not seen many in this color scheme over the years. Exterior The Yellow exterior is in good overall stock condition. This Trans Am has nice Yellow paint and was repainted 26 years ago. The paint is in good overall condition and still shines well but has a few blemishes due to age around the car. The decals still look great and the emblems show well around the car. There are some minor imperfections and paint touch ups that may not be noticeable in the photos, but nothing was intentionally excluded from the photos. The tires have good tread left and the OEM rally wheels are in great shape with no curb rash and come with original trim rings. All weather stripping and window sweeps are in good condition. Trunk is solid and clean with the original space saver spare tire and jack, with a felt trunk mat. This TA was rust proofed when new and much of the undercoating is still visible on the underside of this car. Interior The Black vinyl interior of this Trans Am is in very nice stock condition. The seat covers are in great overall condition. There are no rips or stains and the seats are super comfortable. The carpet is in great condition with no major wear, but there is a mar in the rear passenger area. The original dash is in excellent condition with no fading, cracks, or warping and the dash bezel is in good condition. The stereo was upgraded years ago to a after market Pioneer CD/MP3 player and new front and rear speakers were added. The system sounds great and offers a lot of musical variety. The door panels are in great shape and both door pulls are solid and in tact. The headliner and package tray are in good overall condition but the headliner is drooping on the sides. All interior lights and gauges work as they should outside of the clock. The stereo, horn, wipers, and blower motor also work. This car has not been smoked in; there is no aroma what so ever. Mechanical This Trans Am is in good mechanical condition and comes with a good running Pontiac 400 engine and a four speed manual transmission. The engine was rebuilt around 26 years ago when the car was repainted. Approximately 25,000 miles have been added since the restoration 26 years ago. This Trans Am is a good driver that feels good on the roads. There is no smoke when starting or driving the car. It starts right away every time, idles well, and runs good. The Dynomax muffler was recently added and a newer style cat was added at some point. Also, the engine is clean and nicely detailed as one can see from the photos. This is a factory NON AC car which really cleans up the engine bay and adds to performance. $29,900",1
11,q1,32,d33,11,4.176050419030074,yellow,Chevrolet,Corvette Stingray,"Chevrolet Corvette Stingray 1965 $84,990 To fans of the Corvette, the exciting refinements of the midyear design for 1965 offered real attraction back in the day, and modern collectors still find the thirdyear Sting Ray package very appealing. Fourwheel disc brakes were standard, and the heatexhaust venting worked into the front fenders was now functional. Smoother lines on the hood and grille made the car more stylish. Cosmetically restored in 2017, the example being offered here is a beautiful vehicle equipped with an A.O. Smith body. With a detailed engine bay and underside, this convertible is being sold with its auxiliary hardtop included. The car showcases itself almost delicately in its correct eyecatching Goldwood Yellow exterior, augmented by a black softtop and matched interior. However, any ideas of being domesticated disappear as the 327/365 HP V8 engine comes to life. This is the solidlifter version of Zora ArkusDuntovs legendary smallblock, which features among its attributes the GM block casting number , head casting number , intake casting number and even the No. 2818A carburetor under the chrome air cleaner. A fresh water pump and battery are among its more recent refinements. The highwinding engine is backed by a closeratio Muncie 4speed transmission and a 4.11:1 Positraction rear end. Other unique points of interest are the knockoff wheels with whitestripe tires, sidemounted exhaust pipes, Teakwood steering wheel and optional AM/FM radio with power antenna. The interior also features the redesigned cues for 65, such as widepadded bucket seats and molded door paneling with arm rests. Coupled with the first bigblock models arriving at midyear, many consider 1965 to be a pivotal season for Americas Sports Car. In terms of color, only Tuxedo Black came on fewer editions in 1965 than Goldwood Yellow, and the driveline options on this example make it a standout in terms of true street performance.
